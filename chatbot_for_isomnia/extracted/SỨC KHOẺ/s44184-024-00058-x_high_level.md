# Title: Neurocognitive consequences of adolescent sleep disruptions and their relationship to psychosis vulnerability: a longitudinal cohort study

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of sleep disruptions on cognitive functions and their subsequent relationship to psychosis risk among adolescents. Conducted with a cohort of 3,801 high school students over five years, the research highlights that response inhibition mediates the link between sleep disturbances and psychotic-like experiences. Additionally, spatial working memory deficits correlate with increased psychotic-like experiences, suggesting that these cognitive factors may be critical targets for preventive interventions in mental health.
