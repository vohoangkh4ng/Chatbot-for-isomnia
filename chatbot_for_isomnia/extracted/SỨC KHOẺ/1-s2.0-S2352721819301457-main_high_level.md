# Title: Identifying drivers for bedtime social media use despite sleep costs: The adolescent perspective

## Summary: This article explores the motivations behind adolescents' use of social media at bedtime and its perceived impact on sleep. Through focus group discussions with adolescents aged 11-17, the study identifies two main themes: "Missing Out" and "Norms & Expectations." These themes highlight concerns about offline peer exclusion and social disapproval, which drive adolescents to prioritize social media interactions over sleep. The findings suggest that understanding these social dynamics is crucial for addressing sleep health in adolescents, as insufficient sleep can lead to negative consequences for mental health and academic performance.
