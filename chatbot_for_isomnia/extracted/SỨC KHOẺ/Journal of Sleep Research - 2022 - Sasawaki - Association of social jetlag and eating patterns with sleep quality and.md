# Association of social jetlag and eating patterns with sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in Japanese high school students

## Summary
A high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality has been reported in adolescents, but the effects of social jetlag on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness are unclear. Therefore, we assessed the association of sleep and eating patterns with daytime sleepiness and sleep quality among a total of 756 Japanese high school students. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to evaluate sleep quality, the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale to evaluate daytime sleepiness, and an 8-day sleep diary. Data on average sleep duration, social jetlag, midsleep on free days sleep corrected, and the differences in the first and last meal timing between school days and non-school days were obtained from participants' sleep diaries. The results reveal that social jetlag is associated with differences in the first meal timing between school days and non-school days, and that social jetlag of more than 2 hr is associated with extremely poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness in Japanese high school students. Our findings suggest that reducing social jetlag to within a 2-hr window is important to prevent poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness for this population.

The prevalence of sleep problems is high in adolescents. Many US high school students (68.9%) have reported insufficient sleep (≤ 7 hr on a school night). Adolescents aged 13–19 years old with short sleep duration (< 7 hr on a school night) were about 62.6% in Singapore. Moreover, the average sleep duration of Japanese adolescents aged 15–18 years is 411.9 min (about 6.865 hr) per night in males and 398.8 min (about 6.647 hr) per night in females. Another study reported that the average sleep duration is 380 min (about 6.334 hr) per night among Japanese high school students. These results suggested that many adolescents had short sleep duration.

In addition to short sleep duration, a high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality has been reported in Japanese adolescents. Using the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS), a criterion used to define excessive daytime sleepiness, 23.5% of Russian high school students had a PDSS. score > 17, one of the cutoff points to define excessive daytime sleepiness. According to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a criterion popularly used to define pathological daytime sleepiness, the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness in 15.9% of South Korean high school students was a score > 10. By contrast, the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness, defined as PDSS ≥ 21, was 43.9% in Japanese high school students. For sleep quality, Liu et al. reported that 41.9% of Chinese high school students scored ≥ 6 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), one of the cutoff points used to evaluate poor sleep quality, whereas Shimura et al. showed that 53.1% of Japanese high school students had PSQI scores ≥ 6.

Recent studies have indicated that social jetlag (the divergent sleep phases between weekdays and weekends) may affect circadian physiology, including sleep homeostasis. Although a correlation of social jetlag with sleep quality and daytime sleepiness has been suggested, these relationships have not been fully understood. In addition, how long social jetlag is associated with sleep quality and daytime sleepiness has not yet been revealed. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the correlation between the length of social jetlag and sleep quality and daytime sleepiness taking account of meal timing. This quantitative evaluation by categorizing by the length of social jetlag may clarify what kind of lifestyle we should actually be careful about and help prevent subjective sleep problems.

## METHODS

### Participants

This study was conducted at 13 high schools in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. The questionnaires were distributed by teachers. All participants and their parents were provided with a written explanation of the study. The 3552 students gave informed consent, and responded to two sleep questionnaires and completed an 8-day sleep diary, in which participants recorded their sleep duration and meal timing. The inclusion criteria were that participants completed the sleep questionnaires and demographic questions, and that data spanning five school nights and two non-school nights, including the timing of meals, were recorded in the sleep diary. This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Ethical Committee of Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.

### Questionnaire

Participant sex and age were obtained as demographic variables. The questionnaires consisted of the Japanese version of the PSQI and the Japanese version of the PDSS. The PSQI consisted of seven components: sleep quality (C1), sleep latency (C2), sleep duration (C3), habitual sleep efficiency (C4), frequency of sleep disturbance (C5), use of sleep medicine (C6), and daytime dysfunction (C7). The global PSQI score was calculated by summing up the component scores and indicating sleep quality. A global PSQI score ≥ 6 was defined as poor sleep quality. In addition, a global PSQI score ≥ 8 was used as a cutoff point to define extremely poor sleep quality. Therefore, we used both a global PSQI score ≥ 6 as a cutoff point for poor sleep quality and a global PSQI score ≥ 8 as a cutoff point for extremely poor sleep quality. The PDSS was used to evaluate participants' daytime sleepiness for children and adolescents. The PDSS consisted of eight questions inquiring about sleepiness. A global PDSS score ≥ 21 was used as the criterion of excessive daytime sleepiness.

### Sleep diary

Participants recorded their sleep duration in an 8-day sleep diary in this study. We used the longest sleep duration for each night as the main sleep duration. Average sleep duration, social jetlag, midsleep on free days sleep corrected (MSFsc) were calculated by the main sleep duration throughout 7 nights, including five school nights and two non-school nights. School nights were defined as the nights before a school day, and non-school nights were defined as the nights before a day in which participants reported no school and woke up without an alarm clock. According to previous studies, social jetlag was calculated as follows: social jetlag (hr) = average midsleep on non-school days - average midsleep on school days. Social jetlag indicates the difference between social time and the individual biological clock. We calculated MSFsc according to a previous study:

If SDf ≤ SDW : MSFsc = MSF = (SO f + SD f) / 2
If SDf > SDw : MSFsc = MSF - (SD f - SD week) / 2

where MSF = midsleep on non-school days; MSFsc = midsleep on non-school days sleep corrected; SDw = sleep duration on school days; SDf = sleep duration on non-school days; SD week = average sleep duration across the entire week; and SO f = sleep onset on non-school days.

Moreover, participants recorded their timing of breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks in the sleep diary. The times of the first and last meals were obtained from these records. First or last meal was defined by the meal that individuals ate regardless of breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at first or at last in that day. The difference in first or last meal timing between school days and non-school days was calculated as follows:

Difference in first meal timing between school days and non-school days (hr) = average time of the first meal on non-school days (hr) - average time of the first meal on school days (hr)

Difference in last meal timing between school days and non-school days (hr) = average time of the last meal on non-school days (hr) - average time of the last meal on school days (hr)

2.4 | Data analysis

participants included 258 individuals aged 15 years, 340 individuals aged 16 years, 156 individuals aged 17 years, and two individuals aged 18 years. The descriptive statistics of participants are shown in Table 1. In addition, the distributions of social jetlag and difference in first and last meal timing between school days and non-school days are represented in Figure 1.

Next, we performed the correlation analysis between social jetlag and difference in first and last meal timing between school days and non-school days because a correlation between social jetlag and the difference in meal timing between weekdays and weekends of breakfast and dinner was reported in adults, but this relationship was not fully understood in high school students. Figure 2 shows the correlation between social jetlag and difference in first and last meal timing between school days and non-school days. There was a positive correlation between social jetlag and difference in first meal timing between school days and non-school days (Pearson's r = 0.565, p < 0.001). Interestingly, there was no significant correlation with difference in last meal timing between school days and non-school days (Pearson's r = 0.022, p = 0.547).

Previous studies have not cleared the correlation between the length of social jetlag by quantitative classification, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Social jetlag was categorized into three groups according to the absolute value in this study. Table 2 shows the demographic characteristics, sleep habits and eating habits grouped by the absolute values of social jetlag. Individuals with longer social jetlag exhibited both a longer difference in first meal timing between school days and non-school days and a later chronotype. Additionally, the average sleep duration of participants with social jetlag ≤ 1 hr and those with social jetlag > 2 hr was significantly shorter than that of participants with social jetlag > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr. The sleep duration on school days of participants with social jetlag > 2 hr was shorter than that of participants with social jetlag > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr and those with social jetlag ≤ 1 hr. The bedtime and midsleep time on school days of participants with social jetlag > 2 hr was later than that of participants with social jetlag > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr and those with social jetlag ≤ 1 hr. Moreover, the sleep duration on non-school days of participants with social jetlag > 2 hr and those with social jetlag > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr was longer than that of participants with social jetlag ≤ 1 hr.

analysis using the Bonferroni method revealed the following: (1) females had higher PDSS scores than males; (2) participants aged 17 years and older had higher PDSS scores than participants aged 15 years; (3) participants with social jetlag > 2 hr had higher PDSS scores than participants with social jetlag ≤ 1 hr; and (4) participants with later MSFsc (MSFsc > 3:25) had higher PDSS scores than participants with earlier MSFsc (MSFsc ≤ 3:25).

Table 4 shows the results of multiple logistic regression analysis with sleep quality or daytime sleepiness as dependent variables and demographic characteristics, sleep habits and eating habits as independent variables.

Significantly associated variables for poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥ 6) included the following: (1) 16 years old (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09–2.14); (2) 17 years old and older (OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.70–3.99); (3) sleep duration > 6 hr and ≤ 7 hr (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.23–0.75); (4) sleep duration > 7 hr and ≤ 8 hr (OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.15–0.49); (5) sleep duration > 8 hr (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.12–0.46).

Significantly associated variables for extremely poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥ 8) were as follows: (1) 16 years old (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.10–2.77); (2) 17 years old and older (OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.49–4.23); (3) social jetlag > 2 hr (OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.30–4.98); (4) sleep duration > 6 hr and ≤ 7 hr (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.25–0.76); (5) sleep duration > 7 hr and ≤ 8 hr (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.21–0.65); (6) sleep duration > 8 hr (OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.06–0.32); and (7) later MSFsc (MSFsc > 3:25; OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.16–2.77).

Significantly associated variables for excessive daytime sleepiness (PDSS ≥ 21) were as follows: (1) female (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.31–2.48); (2) 17 years old and older (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.10–2.61); (3) social jetlag > 2 hr (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.20–4.03).

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first study that revealed that not social jetlag > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr, but social jetlag > 2 hr was associated with extremely poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness even considering the difference of first or last meal timing between school days and non-school days. The results suggested that social jetlag > 2 hr affected subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness differently from social jetlag of > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr.

First, this study revealed that there was a positive correlation between social jetlag and difference in first meal timing between school days and non-school days, but there was no significant correlation with difference in last meal timing between school days and non-school days. These results suggested for the first time that social jetlag was correlated with the difference in first meal (the first meal regardless of breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks) between school days and non- | Demographic Characteristics | PSQI Mean | PSQI SD | PSQI p-value | PSQI Post hoc | PDSS Mean | PDSS SD | PDSS p-value | PDSS Post hoc |

Second, this study revealed that the participants with social jetlag > 2 hr have different characteristics about sleep cycle and meal timing on weekends and weekdays in adults. The result of a positive correlation between social jetlag and difference in first meal timing between school days and non-school days in our study is supported by this previous study, but social jetlag and difference in last meal timing between school days and non-school days were not significantly correlated in our study. This discrepancy could be caused by the difference of definition of meals or lifestyle of participants. In addition, previous studies have indicated that the meal pattern affected energy metabolism and the endocrine system. Recent studies reported that social jetlag is | Variable                                      | Poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥ 6) | Extremely poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥ 8) | Excessive daytime sleepiness (PDSS ≥ 21) |

associated with metabolic syndrome and obesity. The correlation of social jetlag with obesity or metabolic syndrome may be influenced by short sleep duration and irregular eating patterns, including difference in first meal timing between school days and non-school days. This study revealed that not social jetlag > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr, but social jetlag > 2 hr was associated with extremely poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥ 8) and excessive daytime sleepiness (PDSS ≥ 21), even considering the meal timing. The results suggested that the effect of social jetlag > 2 hr on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness was different from that of social jetlag > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr. A previous study using the quantitative classification of social jetlag has revealed that not social jetlag > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr, but social jetlag > 2 hr was associated with high waist circumference. This result also suggested that not social jetlag > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr, but social jetlag > 2 hr was associated with health problems. Moreover, our study suggested that a primary affected factor for extremely poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness was not the difference in first or last meal timing between school days and non-school days but social jetlag > 2 hr in this population. The present study also revealed that bedtime on school days and non-school days and wake-up time on non-school days of participants with social jetlag > 2 hr was later than those with social jetlag < 1 hr and social jetlag > 1 hr and ≤ 2 hr. The result suggested that sleep phase of individuals with social jetlag > 2 hr was delayed. Previous studies have reported that individuals with delayed sleep phase experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and insomnia in adolescents, and suggested that delayed sleep phase was correlated with sleep problems. These findings supported that our finding that social jetlag > 2 hr was associated with extremely poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness.

The precise mechanism linking social jetlag > 2 hr, extremely poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness is unclear, but social jetlag of more than 2 hr may trigger circadian disruption. The central clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus drives the sleep–wake rhythm, the circadian rhythm of the autonomic nervous system, body temperature and hormones. Social jetlag indicates misalignment between the biological clock and social time. Therefore, significant circadian misalignment through social jetlag > 2 hr might cause the disruption of physiological rhythms, and consequently correlate with extremely poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness.

Moreover, this present study suggested that sleep duration by sleep diary and chronotype was associated with sleep quality. These results were supported by previous studies suggesting a positive correlation between MSFsc and PSQI scores, and a negative correlation between sleep duration and PSQI scores.

Some limitations exist in this study. First, the sleep diary length is 8 days. Our results may have been affected by this short recording period. However, following a previous study, our sleep diary included five school nights and two non-school nights. This sleep diary composition reflects a typical week for high school students. Second, we did not use an objective evaluation of sleep. Future study needs to utilize both objective and subjective methods of sleep evaluation. However, sleep diaries are considered highly reliable because sleep diary data have corresponded to polysomnographic measures of sleep. Third, our study lacks various demographic data (e.g. family structure, economic status, body weight, body mass index, club membership, caffeine intake, smoking and alcohol consumption) and may include a recall bias on sleep time. In addition, our study did not consider the frequency of breakfast and snacks because we did not have enough information of dietary composition and each participant's defined breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks by their subjective criteria. Previous studies showed the association between short sleep duration and eating snacks or skipping breakfast. Further study needs to consider frequency of breakfast and snacks.

In conclusion, our study revealed that social jetlag > 2 hr is associated with extremely poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness in Japanese high school students. We suggest that reducing social jetlag to within a 2-hr window is important to prevent poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness in this population. | Author(s) | Year | Title | Journal | Volume | Pages |
