# Consumption of energy drinks and their effects on sleep quality among medical students

## Abstract
**Background and Objectives:** Energy drinks contain caffeine, which causes genuine concern among health professionals and authorities about their negative health effects. Their effect on sleep quality specifically was not well studied. In our study, we aim to assess the prevalence of energy drink consumption and its effect on the quality of sleep among Saudi medical students.
**Materials and Methods:** A cross‑sectional study was done on 260 medical students who were in their first till the sixth academic year at King Abdulaziz University Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. An online questionnaire was distributed as a Google form including demographics, the beverage questionnaire (BEVQ‑15), and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI).
**Results:** Coffee was found to be the most favorite (56.5%) caffeinated beverage among medical students, 46.2% reported a sleep duration of 5 h, and 15% reported a sleep latency of more than 30 min. Also, 19.3% were found to have reduced sleep efficiency (less than 74%) and 82.6% used sleep medication once a week. Male students had a significantly higher mean frequency of drinking Energy & Sports drinks (Red Bull, code red, Gatorade, etc.) compared to females. Moreover, 74.6% of the medical students studied had poor sleep quality, with no relationship found between sleep quality and participant demographics, favorite caffeinated beverages, BEVQ‑15 scale scores, or the frequency of energy drink consumption. In contrast, the PSQI and BEVQ‑15 scores showed a significant positive correlation.
**Conclusion:** Students at the university level should be educated on the causes of poor sleep quality and the effect of energy drinks on sleep quality. More research on a larger sample of Saudi university students is needed to determine the scope of the problem.

## Introduction
Beverages marketed as “energy drinks” contain stimulants, particularly caffeine, and are marketed as both mental and physical stimulants. They entice the average user by promising increased energy, alertness, and athletic results. However, there is genuine concern among health professionals and authorities about their negative health effects. There are some safety concerns about energy drink consumption, as well as claims of physiological and behavioral benefits. High levels of caffeine in energy drinks have been shown to have negative effects on the cardiovascular system. Caffeine consumption is known to have negative consequences. High consumption of caffeine is known to have adverse effects, including increased blood pressure in susceptible individuals and sleep problems in adolescents.

During their academic years, medical students experience high levels of subjectivity stress. Academic overload, a lack of leisure time and facilities, fatigue, and increased psychological toxicity are all factors to consider. Caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks, are used to increase alertness. and help people cope with stress, but they have a negative impact on their sleep quality.

A previous study conducted in 2016 confirmed that college students consumed energy drinks primarily to compensate for insufficient sleep, have more energy, drink with alcohol while partying, and primarily while studying.

Another study conducted in the USA in 2011 discovered that participants’ reported stress and their usage of energy drinks had a positive association. However, academic achievement was found to be inversely correlated with this. According to a previous study, freshmen and sophomores had fewer energy drinks in the previous 30 days than junior students. Male students were found to consume more than female students. Moreover, in 2019, in Saudi, the frequency of energy drink users was higher in male nonmedical students (both senior and junior) compared to medical students. The most significant determinant identified was male gender.

Few studies were done in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of caffeinated beverage/energy drink consumption among college students, but none studied the association between energy drinks specifically and their effects on sleep quality in medical students. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of energy drink consumption and its effect on the quality of sleep among Saudi medical students.

### Materials and Methods

**Study design and setting**
This was a cross‑sectional study conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The study duration was from July to September 2021.

**Sample size and sampling**
With a margin of error of 5% and a confidence interval of 95%, a sample size of 260 students was obtained. The inclusion criteria were medical students of both genders studying from the first till the sixth academic year in King Abdulaziz University. The exclusion criterion was medical students with chronic/mental illnesses.

**Data collection**
An online questionnaire was distributed as a Google form that included opening questions about participants’ demographics. The second section of the questionnaire included the beverage questionnaire Beverage Intake Questionnaire (BEVQ‑15) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI).

The BEVQ‑15 was used to assess energy drink beverage consumption (“How much per week”), and total beverage consumption was calculated by adding all beverages together. The average weekly total intake of energy drinks was calculated by multiplying the number of bottles per week by the amount per bottle of each beverage. Total beverage consumption was calculated by adding all beverages together.

The PSQI is a 19‑item self‑reported questionnaire that evaluates sleep quality over the preceding month. The PSQI has identified seven sleep components: sleep duration, sleep disruption, sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency, use of sleeping medicine, daytime dysfunction, and overall sleep quality. The sleep components were scored on a scale of 0–3, with 3 indicating the most severe dysfunction. The overall score ranged from 0 to 21, with higher total scores (also known as global scores) indicating poorer sleep quality. Participants who received a global score of more than 5 were categorized as poor sleepers, while those who received a score of less than 5 were categorized as good sleepers.

**Data analysis**
Data were statistically analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) application version 26. To investigate the association between the variables, the Chi‑squared test (χ2) was applied to qualitative data that was expressed as numbers and percentages. The association between the quantitative nonparametric variables that were expressed as mean and standard deviation (Mean ± SD) was examined using the Mann–Whitney test and the Spearman’s correlation analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine risk factors of poor sleep quality, where the odds ratio was determined at a confidence interval of 95%. Statistical significance was defined as a P value of less than 0.05.

**Ethical considerations**
The research ethics committee at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, approved the study. An online consent was obtained from all students before they completed the online questionnaire.

### Results

**Study population**
Of the study participants, majority were females, younger than 25 years of age, and currently at their clerkship years of medical school. Most of the participants reported that coffee is their favorite caffeinated beverage. The mean PSQI and BEVQ‑15 scores indicated poor sleep quality and high consumption of energy drinks, respectively.

**Sleep disorders among participants**
About less than half of the participants reported a sleep duration of <5 h. A few of them reported prolonged sleep latency of more than 30 min, and most of them had no day dysfunction due to sleep loss. Half of them had normal sleep efficiency; however, the majority reported using sleep aid medication less than once a week. ## Risk factors for poor sleep quality
The study showed that majority of studied medical students had a poor sleep quality based on the PSQI score [Figure 1]. A nonsignificant relationship was found between sleep quality and participants’ demographics, favorite caffeinated beverages, scores of BEVQ‑15 scales, and frequency of consumption of energy drinks (P < 0.05) [Table 3].

## Effect of gender on PSQI/BEVQ‑15 scales
A nonsignificant relationship was found between participants’ gender and all components of the PSQI scale (P > 0.05). Male students had a significantly higher mean frequency of drinking Energy & Sports drinks (Red Bull, code red, Gatorade, etc.) compared to females (P < 0.05) [Table 4].

## Prevalence of consumption of energy drinks among medical students
Coffee was found to be the most consumed drink in this study, which agrees with the findings of another study conducted on 823 Patagonian Chilean college students. In a previous study, 56.5% of the participants reported that coffee is their favorite caffeinated beverage. In contrast, data from another study on University of Sharjah (UOS) students revealed that the majority of students did not consume energy drinks. The current study found that medical students aged 18–24 years had the highest energy drinks (ED) consumption. A study conducted on Italian students reported similar results. The current study discovered that 74.6% of the participants had poor sleep quality [Figure 1], which is consistent with

different studies that found poor sleep quality among college students. That could be explained by the need of medical students to study for longer duration at the expense of sleep time.

Risk factors for poor sleep quality among medical students
In our study, we found a nonsignificant relationship between sleep quality and participant demographics, favorite caffeinated beverages, BEVQ‑15 scale scores, and frequency of energy drink consumption. The results are similar to those of a study conducted in Western Nepal, where the demographic characteristics were not shown to be significantly linked with sleep quality. Our results could be attributed to the use of a subjective method to evaluate the sleep quality, that is, by using a self‑reporting questionnaire, instead of an objective method by using sleep study that could vary from time to time based on different contributing factors other than energy drink consumption. In contrast, a study done among Ethiopian College students found that more than three‑fourths of students used caffeinated beverages, with poor sleepers reporting higher consumption than those with good sleep quality. This could be explained by the known effect of caffeine on the sleep cycle and biological clock.

Relation between sleep quality and energy drink consumption
The PSQI and BEVQ‑15 scores showed a significant positive correlation. This finding appears to be similar to the findings of another cross‑sectional study conducted at the New York College of Podiatric Medicine, which found a link between poor sleep quality and coffee and energy drink consumption. This is not surprising, given the negative effect of caffeine on sleep structure and circadian rhythm.

In addition, a study done in Zambia’s Copperbelt University School of Medicine to assess the consumption of energy drinks among students discovered a significant relationship between sleep quality and energy drink intake. Another study conducted at the UOS discovered a link between energy drink consumption and students’ sleep quality and patterns. In this study, 41% of students consumed energy drinks on a regular basis. Almost 50% of the participants slept normally, while the other half had difficulty sleeping.

Effect of gender as an independent factor on sleep quality
According to the current study, the percentage of female students who slept less than 5 h was 50.54%, whereas the percentage of female students who slept more than 7 h was Table 4: Relationship between participants’ gender and components of the PSQI scale and frequency of consumption of energy drinks

Conclusion

In this study, most of the studied students (74.6%) had poor sleep quality, with a nonsignificant relationship between sleep quality and participant demographics, favorite caffeinated beverages, BEVQ‑15 scale scores, and frequency of energy drink consumption. The PSQI and BEVQ‑15 scores, on the other hand, showed a significant positive correlation. Male students had a significantly higher mean frequency of drinking Energy & Sports drinks (Red Bull, code red, Gatorade, etc.) compared to females.

Recommendation

University students should be educated on the causes of poor sleep quality as well as the effects of energy drinks on sleep quality during their primary care visits. Further research on a larger sample of Saudi university students is required to assess the magnitude of the problem.

Limitations

This study was done on medical students at the King Abdulaziz University (KAU) only, which limits the contribution of other universities in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, because it is a self‑administered questionnaire filled out by the students, there is a possibility for reporting bias in cross‑sectional studies.
