# Title: Changes in Sleep Patterns and Disorders in Children and Adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorders during the COVID-19 Lockdown

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on sleep patterns and disturbances in Italian children and adolescents diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). Through an online survey completed by parents, the research compares sleep behaviors before and during the lockdown among 100 ASD patients, 236 ADHD patients, and 340 healthy controls. Findings indicate that during the lockdown, ADHD children experienced later bedtimes and risetimes, while ASD children maintained their sleep schedules. Overall, both clinical groups exhibited reduced sleep duration and increased sleep disturbances, including anxiety at bedtime and daytime sleepiness, highlighting the unique challenges faced by these populations during the pandemic.
