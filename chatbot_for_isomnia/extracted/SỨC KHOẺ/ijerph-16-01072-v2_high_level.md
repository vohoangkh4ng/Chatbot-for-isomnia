# Title: Does Sleep Mediate the Association between School Pressure, Physical Activity, Screen Time, and Psychological Symptoms in Early Adolescents? A 12-Country Study

## Summary: This study investigates the mediating effects of sleep duration and sleep onset difficulties on the relationship between school pressure, physical activity, screen time, and psychological symptoms in early adolescents. Analyzing data from over 49,000 children across 12 countries, the research finds that school pressure and screen time are linked to increased psychological symptoms, while physical activity is associated with lower symptoms. Sleep plays a significant mediating role in these associations, suggesting that interventions aimed at improving mental well-being in adolescents should focus on managing schoolwork, promoting physical activity, and reducing screen time.
