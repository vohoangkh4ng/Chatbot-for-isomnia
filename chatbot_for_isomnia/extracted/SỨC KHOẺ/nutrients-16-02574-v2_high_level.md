# Title: Social Jetlag on Obesity-Related Outcomes in Spanish Adolescents: Cross-Sectional Evidence from the EHDLA Study

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between social jetlag (SJL) and obesity-related outcomes among Spanish adolescents aged 12-17 years. Utilizing data from the EHDLA project, the research examines how differences in sleep patterns between weekdays and weekends affect body mass index (BMI) z-scores, waist circumference, and body fat percentage. The findings indicate significant associations between SJL and increased obesity-related metrics, with higher odds of excess weight, obesity, and abdominal obesity linked to each 60-minute increment in SJL. The results underscore the importance of addressing circadian misalignment to prevent and manage obesity in adolescents, particularly highlighting a more pronounced effect in boys compared to girls.
