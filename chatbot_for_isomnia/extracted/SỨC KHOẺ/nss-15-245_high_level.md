# Title: Medical Cannabis Use Patterns for Sleep Disorders in Australia: Results of the Cross-Sectional CAMS-20 Survey

## Summary: This article investigates the patterns of medical cannabis use among Australians with sleep disorders, based on a subanalysis of the Cannabis as Medicine Survey (CAMS-20). It reveals that a significant portion of respondents (64%) reported using medical cannabis for sleep disorders, primarily insomnia. The study highlights associations between younger age, inhaled administration methods, and the use of THC-dominant products among those treating sleep disorders. Additionally, many participants reported a decrease in benzodiazepine and alcohol use after starting medical cannabis. The findings suggest that medical cannabis is often used alongside other health conditions, indicating a complex interplay in treatment approaches for sleep disorders.
