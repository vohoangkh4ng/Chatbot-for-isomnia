# Sleep problems and self-harm in adolescence

## Background
Although self-harm and sleep problems are major public health problems in adolescence, detailed epidemiological assessment is essential to understand the nature of this relationship.

## Aims
To conduct a detailed assessment of the relationship between sleep and self-harm in adolescence.

## Method
A large population-based study in Norway surveyed 10 220 adolescents aged 16–19 years on mental health, including a comprehensive assessment of sleep and self-harm.

## Results
Adolescents with sleep problems were significantly more likely to report self-harm than those without sleep problems. Insomnia, short sleep duration, long sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset as well as large differences between weekdays versus weekends, yielded higher odds of self-harm consistent with a dose–response relationship. Depressive symptoms accounted for some, but not all, of this association.

## Conclusions
The findings highlight a strong relationship between sleep problems and self-harm. Interventions to reduce adolescent self-harm ought to incorporate sleep problems as a treatment target.

Self-harm among adolescents is a major public health concern with approximately 10% of adolescents having reported self-harm at some stage in their lives. Although there is growing consensus that we need to look beyond psychiatric disorders to fully appreciate the complexity of the antecedents of self-harm, it remains difficult to predict with acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity which young people are at elevated risk of self-harm. As a result, there has been a growth in studies focusing on more specific markers of risk.

In this population-based study, we used data from the youth hordaland-survey of adolescents in the county of Hordaland in Western Norway. All adolescents born between 1993 and 1995 and all students attending secondary education during spring 2012 were invited to participate. The main aim of the survey was to assess the prevalence of mental health problems and service use in adolescents. Data were collected during spring 2012. Adolescents in secondary education received information via email, and time was allocated during regular school hours for completion of the questionnaire. A teacher was present to organise the data collection and to ensure confidentiality. Those not in school received information by postal mail to their home address. Survey staff were available by telephone to answer any queries from both the adolescents and school personnel. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Western Norway.

## Sample
A total of 19 430 adolescents were invited to participate, of which 10 220 agreed, yielding a participation rate of 53%. Sleep variables were checked for the validity of their answers based on preliminary data analysis, resulting in data from 374 adolescents being excluded due to obvious invalid responses (e.g. negative sleep duration or sleep efficiency). Thus, the total sample size in the current study was 9875 with valid responses on sleep and self-harm variables.

## Instruments
### Demographic information
All participants indicated their vocational status, with response options being ‘high school student’, ‘vocational training’ or ‘not in school’. Maternal and paternal education (highest level) was reported separately with three response options; ‘primary school’, # Sleep problems and self-harm in adolescence

Perceived family economy (i.e. how well off they perceive their family to be) was assessed by asking the adolescents how their family economy is compared with most others. Response alternatives were 1 = ‘approximately like most others’, 2 = ‘better economy’ and 3 = ‘poorer economy’.

## Self-harm

Self-harm was assessed using the following question which is taken from the Child and Adolescent Self-harm in Europe (CASE) Study: ‘Have you ever deliberately taken an overdose (e.g. of pills or other medication) or tried to harm yourself in some other way (such as cut yourself)?’ If a participant endorsed the ‘yes’ response, they were asked to complete the following item thinking about the last time they self-harmed if they had self-harmed more than once: ‘Describe what you did to yourself on that occasion. Please give as much detail as you can – for example, the name of the drug taken in an overdose’. Classification of self-harm was done according to the CASE guidelines by two coders and in line with the CASE definition of self-harm: ‘act with a non-fatal outcome in which an individual deliberately did one or more of the following: initiated behaviour (e.g., self-cutting, jumping from a height), which they defined as a score above the 90th percentile of the Total SMFQ-score; intended to cause self-harm; ingested a substance in excess of the prescribed or generally recognised therapeutic dose; ingested a recreational or illicit drug that was an act the person regarded as self-harm; ingested a non-ingestible substance or object’. Frequency of self-harm was also recorded and coded as follows: ‘none’, ‘once’, ‘two or more times’.

A total of 1024 of the 10 220 young people completed the open-ended question on self-harm. In 140 (1.2%) patients, the information was not sufficient to code as self-harm, and for 38 (0.3%) the description did not meet criteria. This resulted in 846 (7.5%) of the total population meeting the criteria for self-harm. In the current sample, after deleting non-valid responses on sleep, a total of 702 (7.2%) met the criteria for self-harm.

## Perfectionism

Perfectionism was assessed by the short version of the Perfectionism (EDI) subscale from the Eating Disorder Inventory. The scale was adapted to a 3-point scale from the original 6-point scale for this study with the response options: ‘not true’, ‘somewhat true’ and ‘certainly true’, and a total score was employed for the present study.

## Sleep variables

### Insomnia

Difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS) were rated on a 3-point Likert-type scale with response options ‘not true’, ‘somewhat true’ and ‘certainly true’. If a positive response was endorsed (‘somewhat true’ or ‘certainly true’), participants were then asked how many days per week they experienced problems either initiating or maintaining sleep. Duration of DIMS was rated in weeks (up to 3 weeks), months (up to 12 months) and a last category over a year. A joint question on tiredness/sleepiness was rated on a 3-point Likert-type scale with response options ‘not true’, ‘somewhat true’ and ‘certainly true’. If there was evidence of tiredness/sleepiness (‘somewhat true’ or ‘certainly true’) participants reported the number of days per week they experienced sleepiness and tiredness respectively. Insomnia was operationalised according to the DSM-5 criteria for insomnia: self-reported DIMS at least three times a week, with a duration of 3 months or more, as well as tiredness or sleepiness at least 3 days per week.

### Other sleep variables

Self-reported bedtime and rise time were indicated in hours and minutes using a scroll down menu with 5-minute intervals and they were reported separately for weekends and weekdays. Time in bed (TIB) was calculated by subtracting bedtime from rise time. Sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were indicated in hours and minutes using a scroll down menu with 5-minute intervals, and sleep duration was defined as TIB – (SOL + WASO). For statistical analyses purposes in the present study, sleep duration was categorised in two.

## Statistic

IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for Mac (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) was used for all analyses. Pearson’s chi-squared test and independent samples t-tests were used to examine differences in demographic, psychological and sleep variables between the adolescents reporting self-harm versus no self-harm. Pearson’s chi-squared tests were also used to examine differences in sleep problems in method of self-harm (i.e. self-cutting and overdose) and frequency of self-harm (none, once, two or more times). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the predictive effect of the sleep variables (independent variables) on self-harm (dependent variable), using ‘no self-harm’ as the reference category. Both crude and adjusted models were examined, the latter adjusting for the following covariates entered in separate blocks: (a) demographics (age, gender, parental education and family economy), (b) demographics+depression (SMFQ total score), (c) demographics+perfectionism (EDI total score), (d) demographics+ADHD (ASRS Inattention and ASRS Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales, and (e) fully adjusted model (i.e. including all covariates). Results

Demographic characteristics of the sample
The mean age was 17.9 (s.d. = 0.8) years, and the sample included more girls (53.3%) than boys (46.7%). The majority (98%) were high-school students. A total of 5.3% of the sample was defined as immigrants as they had both parents born outside Norway. In terms of maternal education, 10.1% had been educated to primary school level, 41.3% to secondary school level and 48.6% to university/college level. The corresponding percentages for paternal education were 10.6%, 46.4% and 43.0% respectively. A total of 67.4% reported having a family economy (income) ‘like most others’, whereas 25.5% had ‘better’ and 7.1% had ‘worse family economy’.

Self-harm
As detailed in Table 1, 7.2% of the population met the criteria for self-harm, of which 55% reported self-harm on two times or more occasions. There were significantly more girls (11%) than boys. Self-harm was significantly associated with lower parental education, poor family economy, as well as more symptoms of depression, perfectionism and ADHD (all P50.001).

Self-harm and sleep
As depicted in Fig. 1 and detailed in Table 1, there was a significant relationship between self-harm and sleep duration. The average sleep duration among adolescents reporting self-harm was 5.33 h, compared with 6.29 h among adolescents without self-harm. Figure 1 shows that a significantly larger proportion of adolescents reporting self-harm slept less than 5 h compared with no adolescents without self-harm. Adolescents reporting self-harm also reported significantly longer SOL, WASO and had larger sleep deficiency than their non-self-harming peers (all P50.001). The differences between weekdays and weekend bedtimes were also larger among those adolescents who self-harmed (P = 0.023) and they also napped more frequently during the day (P50.001; see Table 1 for details).

Method of self-harm and sleep

The prevalence of insomnia among adolescents reporting an overdose (n = 115) was 47%, compared with 43.3% among those reporting self-cutting (n = 547), and 16.6% of those reporting no self-harm. Similarly, nearly half of those reporting overdose tend to sleep less than 4.85 h (1 s.d.), compared with 30.6% among those reporting self-cutting and 13.3% of those reporting no self-harm.

Frequency of self-harm and sleep

There were significant dose–response associations between sleep problems and the frequency of self-harm. The prevalence of insomnia was 48% among adolescents reporting self-harm two times or more, compared with 37% among adolescents reporting having engaged in self-harm once. The same pattern was found for short sleep duration (37% v. 29%), SOL (64% v. 59%) and WASO (30% v. 24%).

Discussion

This population-based study of adolescents demonstrated a consistent association between sleep and self-harm, presenting as a dose–response relationship; the more sleep problems, the higher frequency of self-harm. Self-harm was linked to a range of different sleep parameters, including insomnia, short sleep duration, long SOL and WASO, as well as large discrepancies between weekdays versus weekend bedtimes. Whereas depression did account for some of the association between sleep and self-harm, neither perfectionism nor symptoms of ADHD had any impact on the sleep-self-harm association.

Previous studies have heightened our awareness of the importance of sleep in relation to self-harm and suicidal behaviour, but the measures assessing sleep have typically been brief and non-specific, often using a single item to assess symptom of insomnia. The current study extends this literature by assessing a wide range of different sleep problems, including a full operationalisation of the recent DSM-5 criteria of insomnia. Further, no studies have previously examined the link between sleep duration, in contrast to subjectively reported insomnia. Whereas sleep duration and insomnia may indeed overlap, they Hysing et al

are distinct sleep parameters, with differences in relation to both risk factors and consequences such as school performance and gender patterns. It is therefore important to assess a wide range of sleep parameters, as conclusions regarding one of them (e.g. insomnia) cannot necessarily be generalised to the others (sleep deficit). However, the results from the current study show that the sleep–self-harm relationship is consistent across a wider range of sleep measures. However, inspection of the overlap in confidence intervals suggests that insomnia is a stronger risk factor than some of the other sleep parameters, such as sleep deficiency, SOL and weekday–weekend differences.

As we expected, adolescents who reported self-harm also had higher rates of depression, perfectionism as well as ADHD symptoms than those who did not report self-harm. Knowing from past research that these factors have been linked to both initiation and maintenance of sleep problems, they may be important factors in accounting for the overlap between self-harm and sleep. As hypothesised, depression accounted for some of the association between sleep and self-harm, but the latter association remained significant even in the fully adjusted analyses, which is consistent with previous studies. Theoretically, emotional regulation can serve as a useful framework for understanding this relationship. Indeed, it has been suggested that the effect of sleep problems on emotion regulation may be more marked in adolescents than in adults. This was exemplified in an experimental study comparing sleep deprivation on a catastrophising task in three age groups, with adolescents showing a higher rate of catastrophising when sleep deprived than adults. Symptoms of Sleep problems and self-harm in adolescence

ADHD have also been shown to be related to self-harm and it has been previously suggested that they may explain the link between sleep and self-harm. However, this was not supported in the present study, with impulsivity, inattention and hyperactivity not reducing the strength of the association between sleep and self-harm.

The present study indicates that sleep problems and short sleep duration are sensitive markers for self-harm. The findings also suggest that the relationship between sleep and self-harm varies as a function of method of self-harm. In future research, it would be important to determine whether this relationship is moderated by frequency and medical seriousness of self-harm.

The general effectiveness of sleep interventions in reducing symptoms of both sleep and co-occurring symptoms suggests that such interventions may play a role in the prevention and treatment of self-harm. Incorporating sleep interventions diagnostically to improve self-regulation has been suggested, and has shown promise in reducing symptoms of depression as well as addressing sleep problems. Recently, including healthy sleep in the prevention of self-harm and suicide has been suggested as one of five factors recommended for future interventions. However, further studies are required to determine whether including sleep interventions, as part of self-harm treatment or prevention programmes, is effective.

Strengths and limitations

Although the study has many strengths, there are some potential limitations worth discussing. A limitation of the present study, consistent with other studies which rely on self-report, is that the findings are subject to response biases and may have been affected by demand characteristics. Nonetheless, as far as possible, we have employed widely used questionnaire measures with recognised reliability and validity. The present study is based on a broad and detailed assessment of sleep. Although the definition of insomnia was based on published quantitative criteria, it was not based on a structured interview, which, of course, is difficult to employ in a population-based study.

However, the use of both SOL and WASO to estimate exact sleep duration was a significant strength of the current study, as most population-based studies on sleep rarely provide such detailed measures. Although self-reported sleep parameters, including SOL and WASO typically differ from those obtained from objective assessments, studies have shown that such self-report sleep assessments can be recommended for the characterisation of sleep parameters in both clinical and population-based research.

Self-harm is related to sleep across a wide range of sleep parameters and this relationship is partly accounted for by depression. Addressing both sleep and depression in the prevention and treatment of self-harm may be fruitful avenues for new research. References
