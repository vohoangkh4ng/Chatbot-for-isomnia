## Chronic Administration of Melatonin: Physiological and Clinical Considerations

**Abstract:** Background: Exogenous melatonin is commonly used to treat insomnia, other sleep problems, and numerous medical illnesses, including Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, and mild cognitive impairment in adults and children. There is evolving information regarding issues with the use of chronic melatonin. Methods: The present investigation was a narrative review. Results: Melatonin usage has risen dramatically in recent years. Many countries only allow melatonin prescriptions. In the United States (U.S.), it is classified as a dietary supplement accessible over the counter and can be derived from animals, microorganisms, or, most commonly, made synthetically. No regulatory agency oversees its manufacturing or sale in the U.S. melatonin concentration of marketed preparations varies widely between product labels and manufacturers. Melatonin’s ability to induce sleep is detectable. However, it is modest for most people. Sleep length appears to be less important in sustained-release preparations. The optimal dosage is unknown, and routinely used amounts vary substantially. Melatonin’s short-term negative effects are minimal, resolve at medicine cessation, and do not usually prevent usage overall. Much research on long-term melatonin administration has found no difference between exogenous melatonin and placebo in terms of long-term negative effects. Conclusion: Melatonin at low to moderate dosages (approximately 5–6 mg daily or less) appears safe. Long-term usage appears to benefit certain patient populations, such as those with autism spectrum disorder. Studies investigating potential benefits in reducing cognitive decline and increased longevity are ongoing. However, it is widely agreed that the long-term effects of taking exogenous melatonin have been insufficiently studied and warrant additional investigation.

## 1. Introduction
Exogenous oral melatonin is used worldwide to treat insomnia and other sleep-related conditions. It is also commonly used to treat conditions such as autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In recent years, melatonin use has increased significantly in both adults and children. It is estimated that in the United States (U.S.), as many as 2.1% of adults and 6% of children, i.e., over 5 million adults and 4 million children, take melatonin at least monthly. Melatonin is available only by prescription in the United Kingdom, European Union, Japan, Australia. However, it is available to purchase over the counter in the U.S. It is considered a dietary supplement by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S., and therefore, it Is not subject to the same regulations required of prescription pharmaceuticals. Subjugation to the investigation of dietary supplements by the FDA usually occurs on an incidence-based interval. Melatonin taken in low-to-moderate doses (e.g., 5 mg daily or less) for short periods appears safe and well-tolerated. However, concerns have been raised about the possible long-term effects of taking melatonin. Therefore, the present investigation focused on the effects of melatonin administration in both children and adults.

2. Literature Search
The present investigation was a narrative review. In 2022, we performed a comprehensive search for English-language studies related to the chronic administration of melatonin. Our investigation searched the following databases: Pub Med and Google Scholar. The study used the following combinations of keywords: melatonin, insomnia, sleep, aging, dietary supplement, and autistic/autism spectrum disorder. The investigation attempted to use as many recent manuscripts as possible—those within the last five years—but also included papers older than five years if they were particularly relevant to our topic. We also attempted to search for, use, and cite primary manuscripts whenever possible. A summary of the studies reviewed in this paper is outlined in Table 1.

3. Endogenous Melatonin Physiology
The mammalian pineal gland produces melatonin (N-acetyl-5 methoxytryptamine) under direct innervation from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (the central circadian pacemaker). Plasma melatonin concentrations are typically low during the day, rising approximately 2 h before bedtime, remaining elevated through the normal sleep period, and declining rapidly approximately 1 h before wake time. Melatonin levels drop with age, and reduced melatonin levels are found in individuals with mood disorders, dementia, severe pain, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and autistic spectrum disorder.
The role of endogenous melatonin in normal human sleep patterns is not well understood; however, it is generally believed to promote the initiation and maintenance of sleep at night in diurnal mammals. Low nocturnal melatonin levels in humans are often associated with sleep difficulties. Interestingly, in nocturnal mammals, melatonin is still produced at night when they are most active. The significance of this observation is not clear. Melatonin is additionally involved in thymus regulation and immunocompetence. In a larger sense, breakdown of the immune system in the setting of decline in melatonin can result in immunosenescence and consequent inflammation and decline of the brain and body with clinical evidence of anxiety, depression, cognitive decline, pain, and fatigue. These processes can be seen as early inflammatory consequences of degeneration that ultimately result in AD and reduced longevity.

4. Pharmacokinetics of Melatonin
After intravenous administration, melatonin will reach peak plasma levels in approximately 0.5 to 0.6 min. Oral administration results in peak plasma concentration in approximately 60 min. Bioavailability of oral melatonin ranges from 10 to 56% with a mean of 33%. Given the unregulated nature of melatonin, there may be significant variation of bioavailability depending on the source of the exogenous melatonin and the metabolic rate of the patient of which it is administered.
Melatonin is hydroxylation to 6-hydroxymelatonin carried out by CYP1A2 and some other related cytochromes within the liver. There are also reports of metabolism being carried out by CYP1B1, an extrahepatic cytochrome that is capable of the same hydroxylation carried out by CYP1A2. After being hydroxylated, the newly formed 6-hydroxymelatonin will then be conjugated mostly to sulfuric acid, a small percentage will either be conjugated to glucuronic acid, and then excreted in.

## Uses of Exogenous Melatonin
Oral melatonin supplementation has been advocated for treating both short-term and chronic insomnia. This includes both circadian phase delay (delayed sleep-wake phase disorder) and sleep-onset insomnia in adults and children. It is also commonly used for other conditions, including non-24-h sleep-wake rhythm disorder, sleep-wake disturbances in shift workers, jet lag after eastward travel, and sleep onset and maintenance in children and adolescents with autistic spectrum neurogenetic disorders, as well as those with attention-deficit or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. While there are many possibly effective uses of melatonin, each indication needs repeated studies in order to confirm its therapeutic value in said area.

## Available Formulations of Melatonin
Melatonin is available in immediate-release and sustained-release oral tablets, liquid, intranasal spray, transdermal, and sublingual formulations. Recommended doses vary widely, from as low as 0.1 mg to greater than 20 mg. The precise optimal dose for the various melatonin uses is unknown, although typical doses are in the 1–5 mg range. It has been suggested that doses below 1 mg may be as effective as higher amounts. Because the FDA does not regulate melatonin, commercially available formulations can vary in accuracy and may even contain porcine. Individuals may reject these porcine-containing melatonin formulations due to religious or dietary purposes. One study found that actual melatonin content varied from 83% to 478% of the labeled content, with significant lot-to-lot variability, and 26% of the samples contained serotonin as a contaminant. Some writers have recommended that melatonin be more closely regulated in the U.S. and its use restricted to prescription-only. A melatonin-receptor agonist, ramelteon (Rozerem), is available in the U.S. by prescription to treat insomnia.

## Effectiveness of Exogenous Melatonin
The most common use for exogenous melatonin is insomnia. Melatonin is widely believed to have “soporific” (sleep-inducing) effects. Multiple studies have confirmed that an immediate-release formulation taken 30 min before the desired bedtime reduces the time to fall asleep by as little as one minute to over 30 min. This reduction in time to sleep onset is statistically significant but may or may not be clinically significant. Evidence of the ability of exogenous melatonin to increase clinically meaningful sleep duration is less consistent, although this is more likely to occur with a sustained-release formulation. In addition, it appears that some people benefit from the soporific effects of melatonin more than others for reasons that are not clear.

Other common uses of melatonin include treating children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, including ASD, and adults with MCI and AD. Multiple studies of melatonin (e.g., both immediate-release and extended-release) in ASD have shown that melatonin decreases the time to sleep onset, increases sleep duration, and decreases nighttime awakenings. The nighttime administration of melatonin was also shown to improve daytime behaviors in children with ASD. However, some research has shown that melatonin use in children may affect hormonal development, mainly delaying the onset of puberty. Despite the lack of research on the long-term effects of melatonin administration in children, multiple studies of adults with AD have also shown improved sleep quality and decreased “sundowning.” Some studies have shown an improvement in cognitive function in these patients, while others have been inconclusive. In patients with Parkinson’s disease, melatonin improved the quality of sleep as measured by subjective standards, although not by objective criteria (polysomnography), and it did not affect motor symptoms. Melatonin has also been studied for its neuroprotective effects and how it affects neuroplasticity. Specific areas of clinical interest include cerebral. ischemia, neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and children with persistent post-concussive symptoms. Additional studies are needed to verify the effectiveness of melatonin for these indications and determine optimal dosing.

## Short-Term Side Effects of Taking Melatonin
Exogenous melatonin appears to be very safe in moderate doses (less than 5 mg) for short periods. All commonly reported side effects are minor and resolve once medication usage is ceased. The most frequent side effects are headache and somnolence (fatigue). However, one study found no difference in the incidence of these symptoms between the placebo and melatonin groups. Other reported side effects include hypotension, hypertension, dizziness, gastrointestinal upset, vivid dreams, irritability, bedwetting (in children), and depression. However, a meta-analysis by Buscemi et al. and a study by Van der Heijden et al. found no significant differences in side effects between melatonin and placebo.

Multiple potential drug interactions have been reported. Tricyclic antidepressants, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, caffeine, and oral contraceptives may decrease melatonin metabolism, and thus, increase serum melatonin concentrations. In contrast, carbamazepine, omeprazole, beta-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, alcohol, and smoking may decrease serum concentrations. Melatonin can increase the risk of bleeding in those taking exogenous doses as related to recent studies that show that there may be a dose-response relationship between coagulation activity and plasma levels of melatonin. In this study, Wirtz et al. found decreased plasma levels of coagulation factors FVIII:C and Fibrinogen 1 h after oral administration of 3 mg melatonin. There is little primary literature that targets melatonin and warfarin interaction. Of the few studies performed, there was a small cohort of 10 patients evaluated for potential melatonin-warfarin interaction at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Noha Ashy and K.V. Stroff found increased measures of INR (international normalized ratio) and PT (prothrombin time) in patients that were administered both melatonin and warfarin. Melatonin can also decrease the effectiveness of extended-release nifedipine for blood pressure control. It can potentially decrease the effectiveness of immunosuppressant medication used after organ transplants. Melatonin used with benzodiazepines or zolpidem may cause increased sedation.

Exogenous melatonin does not appear to reduce endogenous melatonin production via rebound insomnia. Withdrawal symptoms have not been reported with cessation of exogenous melatonin. Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.

## Melatonin: Usage and Considerations
### Anti-Aging and Oxidation Protection
Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to several age-related diseases, such as AD and cardiovascular disease, caused by oxidative stress induced by the buildup of ROS. The production of melatonin is not only found within the pineal gland. Some studies have found melatonin production within bone marrow, retina, and gastrointestinal tract. These extra pineal sources of melatonin are produced within mitochondria of the tissues above, and this production significantly decreases with age, with mitochondrial dysfunction increasing. A thorough review published in 2022 discussed the causative factors of aging and how the decrease in melatonin production may be an important factor in aging. Gimenez et al. summarized how exogenous administration of melatonin reduces the oxidation of compounds such as cardiolipin, implicated in cardiovascular disease, and its inhibition in proinflammatory events such as COX-2, amyloid beta toxicity, and mTOR signaling. The reduction of oxidation of compounds related to mitochondrial function may be implicated in an “anti-aging” effect. Essentially, melatonin may preserve mitochondrial function, thus preventing the vicious cycle of oxidative damage that arises in concordance with aging and age-related diseases that have exhibited an ever-increasing incidence within the U.S. population.

9.2. Melatonin as a Potential Marker in Alzheimer’s Disease
The diagnosis and determination of progression of AD is obtained via many tests, including PET scanning for the uptake of flurodeoxyglucose indicating the presence of amyloid beta plaques and tau fibers. Historically, it has been troublesome to use biomarkers within liquid media to track the progression of AD. A 2021 study found a significant difference in nighttime circulating levels of melatonin in AD and age-matched individuals, suggesting this may be a new biomarker to consider in clinical practice; however, more studies need to be performed in order to further evaluate the use of circulating melatonin as a diagnostic tool for this disease.

9.3. Therapeutic for Mild Cognitive Impairment
MCI is a condition that involves impairment of an individual’s memory, reasoning, or perception. This condition is implicated in the progression of AD as an early-stage finding that can be diagnosed with concurrent imaging showing beta-amyloid plaques or tau fibers on a PET scan. A systematic review and meta-analysis of over 22 randomized control trials found that melatonin usage significantly increased the Mini-Mental State Examination score in patients suffering from mild AD. This finding suggests that melatonin may be an effective adjuvant therapeutic option for improving MCI in patients suffering from mild AD.

9.4. Delay of Puberty
There has been concern that long-term exogenous melatonin might delay children’s sexual maturation. This stems from the observation that the highest nighttime melatonin Neurol. Int. 2023, 15                                                                                                     529

levels are found in very young individuals (1–3 years) and that levels drop progressively until adolescence. The drop in nocturnal serum melatonin levels parallels the sexual maturation process. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that artificially keeping melatonin levels high might not allow the triggering of important pubertal developmental steps. Boafo et al. analyzed three human studies that tracked pubertal timing along long-term exogenous melatonin use. The primary focus was melatonin effectiveness or dosing in all three studies, with pubertal timing as a secondary outcome. One study showed no effect on pubertal development based on Tanner scores. A second study showed “perceived pubertal timing as late” (a subjective delay) in melatonin users compared to controls. In a third study, out of 44 children with severe neurodevelopmental difficulties, 5 developed precocious puberty before starting melatonin therapy; however, there was no apparent impact on the onset of puberty in the remaining 39 subjects. Boafo et al. concluded that the number of patients studied was too small to draw reliable conclusions, patient follow-up was incomplete, and measures of pubertal timing were poor. They concluded that the role of melatonin in sexual maturation and the timing of puberty is understudied, and thus, that additional research is necessary.

9.5. Effect on Seizures
There has been concern that melatonin may increase the incidence of seizures in those with a seizure disorder. However, no effect on seizure activity was observed in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in children by Wasdell et al. or by Carr et al. Another study found a decrease in seizures in children who took exogenous melatonin to improve sleep. In patients with epilepsy with idiopathic generalized tonic-clonic seizures, Maghbooli et al. found that the addition of melatonin to patients’ valproic acid treatment was associated with a significant reduction in the severity of epilepsy and improvement in sleep quality.

9.6. Increase in Bone Fractures
There have been reports of increased risk of bone fracture associated with exogenous melatonin. A study of adults in the United Kingdom by Frisher et al. found that adults (average age 65) who received 3 or more melatonin prescriptions (2 mg, extended release) were 44% more likely to suffer a fracture than the control group. Until the association between melatonin and fractures has been clarified, the possibility of increased fracture risk is a reason to use melatonin with caution in older adults and those with previous low-impact fractures.

9.7. Impairment of Balance or Cognition
There have been concerns that exogenous melatonin could impair balance or cognition. Immediate-release melatonin is cleared quickly from the system. Oral, immediate-release melatonin has a half-life of approximately 45 min and time to peak blood concentration of approximately 30 min. A single oral dose of melatonin will increase blood concentrations for approximately 5 h. A study of men and women aged 60–71 in China found that, compared to placebo, a single 3 mg dose of melatonin significantly impaired balance 1 h after ingestion; however, it did not significantly affect cognitive function. A long-term, placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal women found no increase in adverse events, daytime drowsiness, muscle weakness, or impaired balance the day after taking 1–3 mg of immediate-release melatonin; however, higher doses (over 3 mg) of controlled-release melatonin products can potentially cause next-day drowsiness. A study by Gooneratne et al. demonstrated high blood levels of melatonin for an average of 10 h following ingestion of a 4 mg product (3 mg controlled-release + 1 mg immediate-release) compared to 6.4 h following a 0.4 mg product (0.3 mg controlled-release + 0.1 mg immediate-release). For these reasons, caution has been advised when driving or operating heavy machinery within 6 h after taking melatonin, especially after taking controlled-release products. 9.8. Worsening of Restless Leg Syndrome
Taking melatonin may increase leg movements in restless leg syndrome (RLS). A small study of 8 subjects with severe RLS found significantly more leg movement when measured 1 h and 4.5 h after taking 3 mg of melatonin in the evening compared to no melatonin. However, the patients in the study did not report any increase in leg discomfort. In contrast, preliminary evidence shows that melatonin may decrease periodic leg movement disorder symptoms involving involuntary leg movements while sleeping.

9.9. Worsening of Asthma
There has been concern that exogenous melatonin might worsen asthma. However, a small study among people with stable, mild, to moderate asthma found that taking 3 mg of melatonin at night for 1 month did not significantly affect lung function compared to placebo.

9.10. Worsening of Depression and Bipolar Disorder
Extremely high doses of melatonin (250 to 1200 mg daily) have been reported to worsen depression and bipolar disorder. However, a study among people with depression using melatonin 0.5 to 6 mg daily for up to 3.5 years did not report a worsening of depression.

10. Summary
In summary, commonly reported side effects of long-term use of exogenous melatonin are minor, and data from the available studies regarding its long-term safety are generally reassuring. No clinically significant adverse effects have been consistently identified.

11. Conclusions
Exogenous melatonin is widely used worldwide in adults and children to treat insomnia, other sleep disorders, and various other medical conditions, including autistic spectrum disorder, minimal cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease. It is classed as a dietary supplement in the U.S.; hence, it is available over the counter and considered a nutraceutical product by the government. Any regulatory agency does not closely monitor its production and sale as compared to substances described as drugs in the U.S., and the melatonin content of available preparations may vary considerably. The effectiveness of melatonin in initiating sleep is measurable but small in most people. It appears to have less of a role in increasing sleep duration than in sustained-release preparations. Optimal dosing has not been established; commonly utilized doses vary widely. Short-term side effects of melatonin appear mild, resolve when stopping the medication, and do not limit its use in most cases. Many studies of the long-term use of melatonin have shown no difference in the incidence of long-term side effects between exogenous melatonin and placebo. Melatonin taken in low to moderate doses (5 mg daily or less) appears safe for short- and long-term use. However, it is widely agreed that the long-term effects of taking exogenous melatonin have been insufficiently studied. The greater potential therapeutic values of melatonin usage have yet to be explored thoroughly and warrant further research. Some of the most promising potential roles for long-term higher dose melatonin include reduced Alzheimer’s disease related symptoms and increased longevity. Though some experts have advocated for larger doses of melatonin—including over 20 mg per day—a lower dose is a more reasonable dose for adults at present, until additional studies are performed. Using either an immediate relief preparation and/or in combination with an extended-release formulation—e.g., 3 mg immediate release and 3 mg extended release—is a reasonable starting point. Further research is warranted, but preliminary data suggest that melatonin may greatly benefit aging individuals given its relatively safe profile, potential anti-aging effects, mitigation of cognitive decline, and unequivocal improvement in sleep quality.
