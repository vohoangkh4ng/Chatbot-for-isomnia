# Title: Presleep Cognitive Arousal and Insomnia Comorbid to Parkinson Disease: Evidence for a Serial Mediation Model of Sleep-Related Safety Behaviors and Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between presleep cognitive arousal and insomnia disorder (ID) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). It highlights that ID is prevalent among PD patients, with 55.6% meeting diagnostic criteria. The study proposes a serial mediation model where presleep cognitive arousal influences ID through sleep-related safety behaviors and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep. The findings suggest that psychological factors play a significant role in insomnia among PD patients, indicating that targeted interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy could be beneficial for treating ID in this population.
