# Title: The association between Internet usage and sleep problems among Japanese adolescents: three repeated cross-sectional studies

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between Internet usage and sleep problems in Japanese adolescents, utilizing data from three large-scale surveys conducted in 2012, 2014, and 2017. The study finds that while sleep status remained unchanged, increased Internet usage was linked to various sleep issues, including insomnia, shorter sleep duration, later bedtimes, and poorer sleep quality. Notably, longer screen time (over 5 hours) was strongly associated with these sleep problems, particularly due to social media use and online gaming. The findings highlight the need for public health interventions targeting Internet use to enhance adolescent health.
