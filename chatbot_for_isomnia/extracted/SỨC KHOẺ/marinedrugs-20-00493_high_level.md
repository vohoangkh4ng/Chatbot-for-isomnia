# Title: Potential Psychoactive Effects of Microalgal Bioactive Compounds for the Case of Sleep and Mood Regulation: Opportunities and Challenges

## Summary: This review discusses the emerging global epidemic of sleep deficiency and its association with serious health issues, financial burdens, and mental health problems. It highlights the limitations of conventional treatments for sleep and mood disorders, particularly the side effects of benzodiazepines and antidepressants. The article explores the potential of microalgal bioactive compounds as sustainable alternatives that may positively influence mood and sleep disorders. It catalogs microalgae species that produce these beneficial compounds and addresses challenges such as dosage, bioavailability, and interactions with existing treatments. The authors conclude that further investigation into the functionalization of microalgae bioactives could help overcome these challenges.
