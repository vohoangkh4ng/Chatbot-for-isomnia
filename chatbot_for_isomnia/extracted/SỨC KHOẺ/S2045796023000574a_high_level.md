# Title: Subjective and objective sleep alterations in medication-naïve children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis

## Summary: This article summarizes the evidence regarding sleep alterations in medication-naïve children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing sleep parameters between ASD patients and typically developing individuals. They analyzed data from 16 eligible studies, which included 981 ASD patients and 1220 typically developing individuals, focusing on both objective and subjective sleep measures. The findings indicate that medication-naïve ASD patients experience significantly longer sleep latency compared to their typically developing counterparts.
