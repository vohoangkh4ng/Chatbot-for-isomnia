# Title: The mediating effect of after-midnight use of digital media devices on the association of internet-related addictive behavior and insomnia in adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the prevalence of insomnia among adolescents and explores how after-midnight use of digital media devices (DMD) mediates the relationship between internet-related addictive behavior (IRAB) and insomnia. Conducted with 2,712 school students, the findings reveal significant levels of insomnia, with 12.6% experiencing moderate and 3.6% severe symptoms. The analysis indicates that after-midnight DMD use significantly contributes to sleep disparities and mediates 18.2% of the association between IRAB and insomnia. The study highlights the need for preventive policies to address these issues.
