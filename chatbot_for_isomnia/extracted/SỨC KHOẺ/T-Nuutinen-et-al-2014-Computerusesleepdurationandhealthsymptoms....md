**Objectives** This study investigated whether computer use is associated with health symptoms through sleep duration among 15-year olds in Finland, France and Denmark.
**Methods** We used data from the WHO cross-national Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study collected in Finland, France and Denmark in 2010, including data on 5,402 adolescents (mean age 15.61 (SD 0.37), girls 53 %). Symptoms assessed included feeling low, irritability/bad temper, nervousness, headache, stomachache, backache, and feeling dizzy. We used structural equation modeling to explore the mediating effect of sleep duration on the association between computer use and symptom load.
**Results** Adolescents slept approximately 8 h a night and computer use was approximately 2 h a day. Computer use was associated with shorter sleep duration and higher symptom load. Sleep duration partly mediated the association between computer use and symptom load, but the indirect effects of sleep duration were quite modest in all countries.
Conclusions Sleep duration may be a potential underlying mechanism behind the association between computer use and health symptoms.

Introduction

Electronic media use forms an important part of life for today’s children and adolescents. In the US, studies report that media exposure among school-aged children and adolescents is nearly 8 h a day, even when taking multitasking into account. From 2004 to 2009, total media exposure in a typical day among US adolescents increased over 2 h, yet the recommendation for total media use itself is only 1–2 h of quality programming per day.
Previous studies indicate that frequent electronic media use, computer use or TV viewing is associated with mental and somatic symptoms, socio-emotional problems, and tiredness. Many cross-sectional studies have also reported an association between excessive electronic media use and later bedtime, shorter sleep duration, and sleep disturbances.
Various mechanisms may explain the association between media exposure and sleep. Electronic media use may simply delay bedtime and reduce the amount of sleep one gets during the 24-h cycle due to the obligation to wake up early for school in the morning. Also, the bright light of the screen may suppress melatonin secretion, phase-delay the biological clock, and increase mental and physiological arousal, which in turn may make falling asleep more difficult. It is also possible that media, not turned off during the night, may awaken adolescents, at different moments of nights, reducing total sleep time. Because sleep is essential for mental and somatic health as well as daily functioning and because it seems that adolescents are sleeping less than recommended, it is important to study factors which potentially threaten to get sufficient amount of sleep. One mechanism behind the association between electronic media use and health may be that electronic media use reduces or impairs sleep.
Whether the effect of electronic media on sleep and health varies by gender remains unclear. Boys and girls differ in how they use electronic media; boys are usually more frequent users and play more, whereas girls are more engaged in communication activities. Boys and girls also differ in their sleep habits. Girls report longer sleep duration. Girls’ earlier onset of puberty may explain gender differences in sleep during adolescence. Physiological changes during puberty may also influence the sleep–wake cycle, thereby delaying circadian phase. The physiological need for sleep may also increase during puberty. In addition, girls usually experience more health problems than boys do, a phenomenon evident in many countries.
Only few studies have previously examined whether sleep mediates the association between electronic media use and health. Punamäki et al. found among Finnish adolescents that sleep habits and tiredness partly mediated the association between intensive use of information technology and poor perceived health. Barlett et al. reported in a 13-month follow-up study that sleep (time 2) partially mediated the associations between media exposure (time 1) and attention problems, physical aggression, and body mass index (time 3). They suggest that sleep may be a general mediating mechanism between media exposure and health outcomes. To our knowledge, no study exists which specifically focus on sleep duration as mediator between computer use and health symptoms. Because daily electronic media use is increasing, examining the associations between electronic media use and health and investigating the underlying mechanisms is becoming increasingly important.
This study aims to explore the association between computer use and psychological and somatic symptom load among 15-year olds adolescents and to investigate whether sleep duration mediates this association. We used comparative data from representative samples of adolescents from three countries. We hypothesize that computer use is associated with shorter sleep duration, and more symptoms. We also hypothesize that shorter sleep duration is associated with more symptoms, and short sleep duration partly mediates the association between computer use and health symptoms.

Methods

We drew Finnish, French and Danish data from the international WHO (World Health Organization) collaborative study Health Behaviour of School-aged Children (HBSC) from 2010. The survey instrument used in the HBSC study is Computer use, sleep duration and health symptoms

an internationally standardized questionnaire developed by the international research network. The questionnaires were administered in school classes, and the students answered the questionnaire anonymously. The sampling of nationally representative populations within age groups of 11-, 13- and 15-year olds was based on the HBSC study protocol. In Finland, schools were selected by cluster sampling from school registers, taking into account the size of schools and regions. One class was then selected randomly from each school. In France, the sampling method was also school-based cluster sampling that took into account the size of the schools; then, two classes were randomly chosen from each selected school. In Denmark, schools were randomly selected from a complete school register using simple random sampling, and all relevant classes from these schools were included. This study comprises total of 5,402 adolescents (mean age 15.61 years (SD 0.37, girls 53 %) from Finland (n = 2,110), France (n = 1,906) and Denmark (n = 1,386). The national research teams reported the following response rates among 15-year olds: Finland, 96 %; France, 77–80 %; and Denmark, 86 % (among the full sample of 11-, 13-, and 15-year olds). Because the sampling varied somewhat between the countries, counting equivalent response rates is difficult. The Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD) cleaned the data. The criteria for excluding cases were pupils deviating with more than ± 6 months from the mean age in each age group and/or missing more than 25 % of the answers to selected key questions. Total sample size was 5402 from Finland, France and Denmark. In our analyses, we also excluded adolescents missing values for any of the following variables: computer use, sleep duration, psychological or somatic symptom load, and Family Affluence Scale; thus 5,025 adolescents were remained in our analyses. The HBSC study was approved at national levels, and each country confirmed its respective legal requirements. Pupil participation was voluntary in all countries and based on informed consent. In Finland, ethics approval came from the National Board of Education and the Trade Union of Education. In addition, in Finland, schools’ headmasters independently decided whether to participate in the study or not. In France, the Ministry of Education and the French National Commission of Computer Science and Freedom approved the study protocol. In Denmark, no formal agency exists to handle ethical approval of questionnaire-based survey studies in the general population. Therefore, the research team approached the school director, the board of parents, and the board of pupils in each participating school for approval. We assessed computer use on school days with the question: ‘‘How many hours a day do you usually use a computer for chatting, surfing the internet, emailing or doing your homework?’’ Response categories were ‘‘not at all’’, ‘‘half an hour’’, ‘‘1 hour’’, ‘‘2 hours’’, ‘‘3 hours’’, ‘‘4 hours’’, ‘‘5 hours’’, ‘‘6 hours’’ and ‘‘7 hours or more’’. Computer use on school days served as a continuous variable. We calculated sleep duration from pupils’ reports of bedtimes and wake-up times on school days. Bedtimes were asked as follows: ‘‘When do you usually go to bed if the next morning is a school day?’’ Answering alternatives for bedtimes on school nights ranged in half an hour intervals from ‘‘at latest 9 pm’’ to ‘‘2 am or later’’. We assessed wake-up times with the question: ‘‘When do you usually wake-up on school mornings?’’ Response categories ranged in half an hour intervals from ‘‘5 am at the latest’’ to ‘‘8 am or later’’. We then calculated sleep duration using the following formula: 24 - bedtime + wake-up time. We measured psychological and somatic symptom load with the HBSC Symptom Check List (HBSC-SCL), which asks the following question: ‘‘How often have you had the following symptoms during the past 6 months?’’ We included three psychological symptoms (feeling low, irritability or bad temper, feeling nervous; Chronbach’s alpha total 0.76; girls 0.75; boys 0.75) and four somatic symptoms (headache, stomachache, backache, and feeling dizzy; Chronbach’s alpha total 0.64; girls 0.64; boys 0.62). The response categories were: (5) almost daily, (4) more often than weekly, (3) weekly, (2) monthly, and (1) seldom or never. For each student, we added the responses as a simple index of symptom load; the range for psychological symptoms was 3–15, and for somatic symptoms, 4–20. We used these two indices as quasi-quantitative measures in the correlational analyses. The Family Affluence Scale (FAS II), which is an indicator of socioeconomic position, served as a covariate in the models. FAS II is the sum variable of four items: whether the student has his/her own bedroom, the number of cars in the family, the number of family holidays, and the number of computers in the family. The FAS II score ranges from 0 to 7, where 7 is meaning the most affluent position.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics appear as means and standard deviations. We tested differences in computer use, sleep duration, and symptom load between genders within countries using the Mann–Whitney U test and differences within genders between countries with the Kruskall–Wallis test. We calculated Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients for computer use, sleep duration, and psychological and somatic symptom load. We performed descriptive statistics and correlation analyses with Predictive Analytics SoftWare (PASW) Statistics version 18.0 for Windows. To examine associations between computer use, and psychological and somatic symptom load and the mediating role of sleep duration, we used SPSS AMOS 18 to apply structural equation modeling. First, the measurement model, which is equivalent to a confirmatory factor analysis with somatic and psychological symptoms, was examined before testing the structural mediation model. Because the variables were non-normally distributed, we chose an asymptotically distribution-free (ADF) method to examine both the measurement model and the mediation model.

To evaluate whether the measurement model and the mediation models fit the data, we explored several model fit indices including the Normed Fit Index (NFI), Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Root Mean Square Error Approximation (RMSEA), Root Mean Square Residual (RMR), and v2 test. To obtain adequate fit, the following recommended cut-off values are reported, NFI C 0.90, CFI C 0.95, RMSEA B 0.08, and RMR B 0.08. In this study, we followed these cut-off values. A non-significant p value in the v2 test means that the model-implied covariance matrix is equivalent to the empirical covariance matrix. The v2 test is very sensitive to large sample sizes and a non-significant p value is unlikely with large sample sizes.

Based on the results of the measurement model, we formulated two latent variables: psychological symptom load and somatic symptom load. The measurement model achieved adequate fit in all six different groups. Factor loadings varied from 0.338 to 0.821 and correlations between the latent variables varied from 0.586 to 0.740. The mediation model included this measurement model.

The mediation models were made separately for boys and girls and separately for each country across six groups. From the mediation model, standardized direct effects of computer use on symptom load, standardized indirect effects, and standardized total effects (direct + indirect effects) are reported as regression coefficients with their standard errors, 95 % CI, and p values. We performed bootstrapping (500 bootstrap resamples) to estimate the CI and p values. Indirect effects describe the proportion of the association between the independent and the outcome variable, which goes through the mediator variable. We also applied terms as direct effects, indirect effects and total effects later in the text.

## Results

Table 1 shows that computer use did not differ between boys and girls in Denmark and Finland, whereas in France the mean computer use time was higher among girls than boys. In Finland, girls slept less than boys and in Denmark boys slept less than girls. In all countries, psychological and somatic symptom loads were higher among girls than boys. Danish girls used computers more, slept less, and reported lower symptom loads than did girls in Finland and France. The boys differed from each other in their computer use, sleep duration and symptom load; French and Finnish boys, however, showed no differences in either psychological or somatic symptom load. In all countries, increasing computer use was associated with shorter sleep duration and higher somatic symptom load. With the exception of boys in France and Denmark, high computer use was also associated with higher psychological symptom load. Decreasing sleep duration was associated with higher psychological and somatic symptom load in all groups, except among Danish boys. Among Danish boys,

the shorter the sleep duration the higher somatic symptom load was, but sleep duration did not correlate with psychological symptom load (Table 2)
According to most fit indices, the structural equation models achieved adequate fit in all six groups. Computer use was associated with shorter sleep duration and shorter sleep duration was associated with higher psychological and somatic symptom load in all groups. The model explained more of the variance in psychological symptom load (r2) among girls than boys, and the associations between computer use and symptom load were somewhat stronger among girls than among boys. Direct effects of computer use on psychological and somatic symptom loads were significant in most groups, even when sleep duration was included in the models. Except among boys in Denmark and France, computer use was not directly related to psychological symptom load, and among French boys it was unrelated to somatic symptom load. Indirect effects of computer use on psychological and somatic symptom loads through sleep duration were quite modest, but significant in all groups except among Danish boys where computer use was not indirectly related to psychological symptom load through sleep duration (Table 3).

## Discussion

The present study of adolescents in Finland, France and Denmark shows that frequent computer use was associated with shorter sleep duration and higher psychological and somatic symptom loads. These results are in line with previous results as well as our hypotheses. Also, shorter sleep duration was associated with higher symptom load, as it was hypothesized. According to previous results, it was also hypothesized that sleep duration mediates the association between computer use and symptoms. Sleep duration partly mediated the association between computer use and psychological and somatic symptom loads. The indirect effects through sleep duration were, however, quite modest. Computer use was also directly associated with symptom load when sleep duration was included in the model. Thus, mediation was only partial. We observed the same kind of mediation pattern in all groups except among Danish and French boys. Among French boys, computer use was related to psychological and somatic symptom loads only through sleep duration, and among Danish boys, computer use associated with somatic symptom load only through sleep duration.

Punama¨ki et al. and Barlett et al. have reported similar kind of results that sleep mediated the association between electronic media use and health. Punama¨ki et al. found that intensive information and technology use, including computer use and mobile phone use, were associated with poor perceived health, including poor health status, musculoskeletal symptoms, and health complaints among 12- to 18-year olds. | Variable                     | Boys (B)         | Girls (G)        |

association was mediated through impaired sleep habits; sleeping hours and regularity of bedtimes, and waking-time tiredness. Frequent computer use was associated with poorer health, particularly among boys, as was intensive mobile phone use among girls. In our study, we did not statistically test gender differences, but the model explained more of the variance in psychological symptom load among girls than among boys, and the associations between computer use and symptom load were somewhat stronger among girls than among boys. Barlett et al. (2012) reported that among school-aged children (mean age 9.6), baseline screen time was associated with baseline short sleep duration which, in turn, was associated with short sleep duration 7 months later, which was associated with higher body mass index, teacher-reported attention problems, and physical aggression 13 months later.

Strengths of this study include large random samples of pupils in three countries with high response rates and essentially comparative measurements. Our research question was novel, particularly focusing on short sleep duration as mediator between computer use and health symptoms. We also examined boys and girls separately, and found small differences between genders. As the associations were quite similar, especially among girls, in each country, it strengthens the hypothesis that computer use affects sleep duration and health symptoms, and not the other way round.

Of course, certain limitations should be considered in interpreting these findings. The cross-sectional design of the study makes it impossible to draw causal conclusions from the analyses, whereas the statistical method applied is generally based on the idea understanding that the pathways are causal. Although we have selected computer use as the determinant and somatic and psychological symptom load as the outcome measures, the causal pathway may potentially be opposite (i.e. adolescents with high symptom loads may react in an introverted way and use computers more than adolescents with low symptom loads). Furthermore, we are uncertain whether short sleep duration is an outcome of computer use and a determinant of symptom load. We neither can exclude the possibility that adolescents with difficulty falling asleep use computers more than other adolescents do nor can exclude the possibility that short sleep duration is a result of high symptom load. Such circumstances would compromise our model. A common idea in this area of research, however, is that high computer use and short sleep duration are causally related to health problems such as psychological and somatic symptoms ## Computer use, sleep duration and health symptoms

Further, several of the researchers who have published in this area suggest that excessive electronic media use leads to less sleep. Consequently, the use of structural equation modeling, which enabled us to examine indirect effects and how well this specific structure explains the variance of the latent variables, was empirically justified.
A limitation is that the proportion of those with school repetitions varies between countries. The proportion of adolescents who have repeated the class was small in Finland and in Denmark (0–1 %), but it was much more common in France (38 %). It is possible that health symptoms are more common among those who repeated the class. Because they have been excluded there might be a selection bias regarding the French data. The response rate varied between the countries. However, the response rate was relatively high also in the French data, 77–80 %, therefore, we do not think this is a big selection bias problem.
Another potential limitation is the measurements of the applied variables. Although computer use was measured with a fairly simple and straight-forward question, the measurement was sufficiently reliable and valid. The question regarding computer use did not distinguish doing homework from other uses which can be seen as a weakness because doing homework may be linked to school grade which might be linked with psychological symptom load. The fact that most mobile phones these days have access to internet and a wide variety of portable devices further complicates the accurate measurement of computer use. Sleep duration measured with self-reported bedtimes and wake-up times seems to be a valid measure of sleep when reference methods among adolescents have been sleep diaries and actigraphy. Several studies have confirmed the validity of the HBSC-SCL. Ravens-Sieberer et al. used item response theory and concluded that the seven items applied formed a valid scale. Haugland and Wold reported high test–retest reliability of the items and qualitative analyses showed acceptable reliability. In previous confirmatory factor analyses, Hetland et al. demonstrated that the HBSC-SCL reflects two correlated sub-factors: psychological and somatic symptoms.
Finally, unmeasured confounding factors may represent potential limitation of the study. Other factors may also contribute to explanations of the association between electronic media use, sleep, and symptom load among young people. In this study, we examined the possible mediating effect of sleep duration because that computer use may | Variable                     | Boys (B)            | Girls (G)           |

plausibly reduce sleep duration, and reduced sleep duration may lead to more health problems. This relationship is surely complex, and many other possible mediating or explaining factors exist such as lack of physical activity, and sedentary lifestyle, which is related to somatic (overweight) and mental health as well as sleep. Stress at school may impair sleep, reduce sleep efficiency, impair sleep quality and reduce sleep duration. In addition, social factors may explain the associations between computer use, sleep, and perceived symptoms such as loneliness, bullying or problems with family functioning. Socioeconomic differences in health and health behaviors are broadly reported; the lower the parents’ socioeconomic status the poorer the adolescent’s health. Adolescents’ electronic media use also varies by their parents’ socioeconomic status. In a Finnish study, the father’s higher socioeconomic status was associated with more frequent computer use among adolescents and lower socioeconomic status was associated with more frequent mobile phone use.

Future research would do well to adjust for the multitude of family and social factors that can influence symptom load among young people. Also, the assessments of computer use should specify and include the content, timing (bedtime or daytime use), as well as evaluate problematic, addictive Internet use, because internet addiction itself may lead to cognitive, emotional and behavioral symptoms. Specific characteristics of computer use can help one to identify which kind of computer use is harmful and which kind is not, or which kind may even prove beneficial.

As a conclusion we found that sleep duration partially mediates the association between computer use and health symptoms; the more the computer was used, the shorter the sleep duration and the higher the symptom load. The associations were quite similar across three countries despite varying symptom prevalence and computer use. In addition, many adolescents in Finland, France, and Denmark sleep less than recommended. Sleep loss during adolescence is actually driven not by a reduction in sleep requirements but arises from a convergence of biological, psychological, and socio-cultural influences where electronic media use clearly plays a significant role. However, parents are seldom cognisant of what happens after they say ‘‘good-night’’ and leave their children and adolescents in their bedroom assuming that they will fall asleep immediately. ## Computer use, sleep duration and health symptoms

Parental monitoring and rules about computer use and bedtimes are vital during adolescence. Despite the evidence, sleep is a topic that has attracted little attention, and thus, we recommend intensified health education about this topic for both adolescents and for their parents. N. Teija et al.
