# Sleep efficiency as a determinant of insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese adolescents

Insulin resistance (IR) occurs in a transient manner during puberty. Obese adolescents may be at risk for persistent IR during puberty. The objective of the study is to review the literature on the association of the anthropometry and lifestyle characteristics with insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese adolescents, and include data from a new study. Relevant papers were selected and reviewed. In addition, 137 overweight and obese adolescents (42 male/95 female, age 14.4 ¬± 2.3 years, BMI z-score +3.3 ¬± 0.7, HOMA-IR 3.4 ¬± 1.8) from the Centre for Overweight Adolescent and Children‚Äôs Healthcare (MUMC+) were included in this study. Anthropometrics, Tanner stages, sleep characteristics, food intake behaviour and physical activity were determined, and possible associations with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were tested.

Results: Overweight and obese adolescents with unfavourable fat partitioning and family history of NIDDM are at risk for persistent IR. Overweight and obese adolescents from the new cohort showed a higher HOMA-IR postpubertally. BMI z-score, age, pubertal stage and prepubertally total sleeping time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE) were identified as significant contributors. Overweight and obese adolescents showed a persistently higher instead of transiently higher HOMA-IR during puberty, associated with BMI z-score, age, pubertal stage and prepubertally less TST and SE.

## Introduction

During puberty, adolescents undergo a series of biological, cognitive and psychosocial changes. One of the hallmarks of puberty is a change in endocrine conditions and changes in anthropometric factors, such as height, body weight and body composition. In parallel, behavioural changes, such as sleeping time, food intake behaviour and physical activity, driven both by biological processes or social and academic pressures, occur. Together, these factors pose an increased risk for the development of excess weight and obesity, as well as comorbidities such as insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but also non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This review discusses insulin insensitivity during puberty, reviewing the existing evidence for possibly related changes in body weight, especially overweight and obesity, sleep characteristics, physical activity and food intake behaviour. In addition, data from a new, recent study on possible relationships between sleep efficiency (SE) and insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese adolescents are reported.

## Transient IR at Puberty

Puberty is associated with transient IR and hyperglycaemia, due to an impaired ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake. In response, Œ≤-cells in the pancreas increase the production of insulin, leading to the clinical hallmark of high insulin concentrations in the presence of normal to high glucose concentrations. IR, followed by impairment of insulin secretion, can eventually lead to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

IR is a transient physiological stage of normal development. Healthy children with a normal weight experience a stage of physiological IR that starts to rise in mid-childhood, some years before puberty, peaking at mid-puberty and resolving to near prepubertal levels by the end of puberty (Tanner stage 5). Girls, however, are more insulin-resistant than boys at all Tanner stages. In normal weight children, the IR during puberty development is compensated by a sufficient pancreatic Œ≤-cell response to maintain glucose homeostasis. Other metabolic characteristics of pubertal insensitivity to insulin are decreased glucose oxidation and increased free fatty acid oxidation.

It is well known that IR is strongly associated with BMI and body composition. Given that IR can occur during puberty in the absence of changes in BMI, and independently of changes in body fat, factors other than anthropometric changes have to be carefully examined in the onset of pubertal IR. Because of the considerable change in endocrinological parameters, hormones may play a crucial role in the association of puberty and transient IR. One of the most essential changes accompanying pubertal development is the rise in sex hormone concentrations, from barely detectable levels in early childhood towards adult levels in late puberty. IR, however, has not been # DIABETES, OBESITY AND METABOLISM

shown to be associated with testosterone or estradiol levels. It has been hypothesized that the IR of normal puberty might be related to the GH/IGF-I axis. Plasma IGF-I levels are primarily regulated by GH, and GH is a counterregulatory hormone known to be a potent insulin antagonist. Indeed, strong evidence was found for the contribution of hormonal changes in growth hormone/IGF-I to pubertal IR. Moran et al. demonstrated that IGF-I levels in boys and girls rise and fall during the course of puberty in concert with the well-recognized rise and fall in IR. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), the primary carrier protein of IGF-I, correlates positively with IR, whereas IGFBP-1, which is inhibited by insulin, correlates inversely with IR. The data suggest that physiological elevation of the IGF-I/GH axis contributes to the relative IR of normal puberty.

Although pubertal IR is a normal physiologic process compensated by a sufficient pancreatic ùõΩ-cell response to maintain glucose homeostasis, it may contribute to pathology in the presence of pancreatic ùõΩ-cell dysfunction in genetically/epigenetically at risk and obese children. Hyperglycaemia develops once the ùõΩ-cell insulin secretion can no longer compensate for the level of IR. In children, the rate of passage from impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose (IGT/IFG) to NIDDM happens faster compared with adults and can occur over the span of only 12‚Äì21 months. The majority of NIDDM in childhood concerns girls, consistent with their greater adiposity and IR.

IGT is also increasingly common in adolescents. However, as they complete puberty, insulin sensitivity is often restored and hyperglycaemia resolves, as the pancreas is able to meet insulin demands again. Cree-Green et al. suggest that it may be that the transient IGT seen in these teens is similar to that of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), implying that these teens will be at increased risk of NIDDM later in life, compared with obese teens with no IGT.

The divergence in the development of transient or persistent IR during puberty emphasizes the importance of longitudinal research. Goran et al. performed a longitudinal study in 60 children and examined them at Tanner stage 1 and after 2.0 ¬± 0.6 years of follow-up, by which time 29 children remained at Tanner stage 1 and 31 had progressed to Tanner stages 3 or 4. They report that in children progressing to Tanner stage 3, insulin sensitivity fell significantly by 32%, acute insulin response increased by 30%, and the disposition index determined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test fell by 27%, with a significant increase in fasting glucose and insulin. In children remaining at Tanner stage 1, however, there was a slight increase in insulin sensitivity, with no significant change in acute insulin response or fasting glucose and insulin. The pubertal fall in IR was more consistent in African Americans, remained significant after controlling for age, sex and change in fat mass, visceral fat and fat-free mass, and was similar in children at low, medium and high body fat. The pubertal transition from Tanner stage 1 to Tanner stage 3 was associated with a 32% reduction in insulin sensitivity and increases in fasting glucose, insulin and acute insulin response were similar across sex, ethnicity and obesity. The significant fall in deposition index suggests conservation of ùõΩ-cell function or an inadequate ùõΩ-cell response to the fall in insulin sensitivity. The fall in insulin sensitivity was not associated with changes in body fat, visceral fat, IGF-I, androgens or estradiol. In addition, Goran et al. report on a longitudinal study on deterioration of insulin sensitivity and ùõΩ-cell function in overweight Hispanic children during pubertal transition. They examined 1-year changes in insulin dynamics in overweight Hispanic children at high risk of type 2 diabetes as a function of body composition and pubertal transition. They report an increase in fat mass by 13% (3.0 kg) and a decline of insulin sensitivity by 24%. The fall in insulin sensitivity over 1 year remained highly significant even after adjusting for baseline fat mass, age, gender and change in fat mass. The fall in insulin sensitivity was not significantly influenced by Tanner stage. However, subjects in earlier maturation showed appropriate ùõΩ-cell compensation, whereas subjects in the later stages of maturation did not. They conclude that failure to increase the acute insulin response in response to the fall in insulin sensitivity may be one factor in the pathogenesis of the progression of paediatric NIDDM. Taken together, interventions to prevent persistent IR during puberty are necessary.

Transient insulin resistance occurs during puberty, yet when combined with obesity this may be persistent, implying an increased risk of NIDDM later in life

# Development of Excess Weight and Obesity

During Puberty

Excess weight and obesity are major components determining whether IR will be transient or persistent after puberty. Therefore, it is necessary to start treatment and prevention of this chronic disease as early as possible during childhood and puberty. Possible determinants of excess weight and obesity include a rapid catch-up growth after birth to the first birthday, as well as parental influences, that is overweight father and dietary restrained eating behaviour of the mother. Later in life, lifestyle factors of the adolescents themselves, such as restrained eating behaviour and physical activity habits, become more important. As for transient IR, hormonal changes during puberty may also imply a risk of excess weight and obesity.

These changes encompass changes in gonadotropic hormone concentrations, but also leptin concentrations. In girls, a peak in leptin concentrations, observed in Tanner stage 2, precedes a peak in lutein hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations in Tanner stage 3. Both in boys and girls, the leptin/FM ratio decreases from Tanner stage 2 onwards. In boys, this decrease continues throughout puberty, while in girls, this ratio rebounds again in Tanner stage 5. These observations imply that during puberty factors independent of fat mass become more important in the regulation of plasma leptin concentrations. The relationship between leptin and gonadotropic hormones during puberty is sex specific with respect to function and timing. Leptin has been shown to be essential in reproductive functioning in both boys. review article
and girls. In girls, leptin is suggested to act as a permissive factor for the onset of puberty. Several studies that showed a deficiency in leptin in anorexia nervosa, or hyperleptinaemia in morbid obesity during puberty, demonstrated a disturbance of onset as well as progression of puberty in such leptin disturbance states as anorexia nervosa or obesity-related hyperleptinaemia. With regard to timing, an early leptin peak during puberty, especially in girls, was suggested to contribute to the risk of overweight and obesity.

An initial rapid increase in body weight, parental influences, dietary restrained eating behaviour, reduced physical activity and hormonal changes such as an early leptin peak, especially in girls, are suggested to contribute to the risk of excess weight and obesity

Changes in Sleep Duration in Relation to Excess Weight and Obesity During Puberty

In addition to the sex differences in anthropometric and endocrine variables observed in the transition from Tanner stages 1 to 5, a significant reduction in sleep duration is observed. Pubertal status appears to be inversely associated with sleep duration. Studies on the relationship between sleep duration and body weight in adolescents report a consistent inverse association between habitual sleep duration and body-weight development. This relationship remains independent of baseline BMI at the start of puberty, fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) allele genotype (rs9939609), parent BMI, as well as changes in Baecke scores and hours of television viewing during the progressive Tanner stages. However, because of the parallel development it is impossible to disentangle cause and consequence between the variables. Puberty is initiated through pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release from the hypothalamus and activation of the gonadal axis. The subsequent development of secondary sex characteristics originates from shared neuronal systems, with the hypothalamus as integration point. The hypothalamus regulates the sleep‚Äìwake and feeding circuits. Circuits are connected through the hypocretin-1 hormone that regulates feeding and locomotor activity via the nucleus accumbens, as well as signal transduction on the light‚Äìdark cycle to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Changes in hypothalamic functioning, such as disturbed hypocretin-1 signalling, are associated with disturbance of the circadian cycle and feeding behaviour, affecting energy balance and body composition. Consequently, changes in hypothalamic functioning may explain the relationship between the changes in BMI and in sleep duration during puberty. This hypothesis is underscored by altered hormone concentrations, such as lower leptin concentrations, diminished insulin sensitivity and altered cortisol concentrations in short-sleeping adolescents, with the latter significantly contributing to lipogenesis.

DIABETES, OBESITY AND METABOLISM
Integration of Determinants of IR During Puberty

Thus far we can state that puberty is a vulnerable period in life for developing IR and obesity. Specific determinants may include sleep characteristics, food intake behaviour and physical activity.

With progressive Tanner stages, BMI increases and sleep duration decreases in an interrelated way. Changes in hypothalamic functioning may explain the inverse relationship between the changes in BMI and in sleep duration. Sleep is an important factor for normal growth and development during childhood. Especially TST total sleeping time (TST) and quality sleep [QS: (slow wave sleep, SWS + rapid eye movement sleep, REM)/TST] are crucial sleep factors associated with outcomes on physical, cognitive, emotional and social development in children. Sleep deprivation and poor QS have been identified as an independent risk factor for the development of IR. Until now, a limited number of studies on sleep in relation to IR have been conducted in adolescents. For instance, when effects of partial sleep deprivation on markers of glucose metabolism was assessed during three consecutive nights of short sleep, acute sleep restriction appeared to reduce insulin sensitivity in adolescent boys. Also, observations on sleep duration and IR assessed in healthy black and white adolescents show reduced sleep duration associated with increased homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). It is suggested that interventions to extend sleep duration may reduce diabetes and obesity risk in youth. A cross-sectional analysis from two examinations conducted in the Cleveland Children‚Äôs Sleep and Health Cohort (n = 387; 43% minorities) shows a quadratic ‚Äòu-shape‚Äô association between sleep duration and HOMA-IR. When adjusted for age, sex, race, preterm status, and activity, adolescents who slept 7.75 h had the lowest predicted HOMA-IR, while adolescents who slept 5.0 or 10.5 h had HOMA-IR indices that were approximately 20% higher. It was concluded that shorter and longer sleep durations are associated with decreased insulin sensitivity in adolescents. A second target for improving insulin sensitivity directly as well as indirectly by its effects on sleep characteristics concerns the lifestyle factor physical activity. Multiple studies found that increasing physical exercise increased insulin sensitivity in overweight adolescents, even in the absence body weight or fat mass changes. Physical exercise improves the insulin sensitivity of important insulin target tissues, such as skeletal muscle, even hours after the exercise has been completed, thereby increasing glucose uptake. These results support the importance of exercise in all therapies targeting the improvement in IR and diabetes risk. As a third component, food intake behaviour is generally accepted as one of the main causes for the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome, with energy intake exceeding energy expenditure leading to increased energy storage in the body. Therefore, treatment of DIABETES, OBESITY AND METABOLISM

obesity and IR aims to decrease energy intake and promote healthy food choices. Eating behaviour and eating habits change during childhood, especially in puberty. This is also the time that many eating disorders, such as binge eating disorder, become apparent, possibly due to issues related to self-esteem and body image. Many studies have found an association between sleep deprivation and food choices. Sleep-deprived individuals appear more prone to choose unhealthy foods high in energy and fat content. Also, sleep-deprived individuals are reported to have more frequent meals or snacks between meals compared with individuals who had sufficient sleep. It has been presumed that sleep deprivation is associated with decreased leptin concentrations and increased ghrelin concentrations, thereby promoting the feeling of hunger and suppressing satiety. A reduced sleep duration, reduced quality of sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, or fragmented sleep enhance a positive energy balance through altered substrate oxidation, hormone concentrations, sleeping metabolic rate, appetitive behaviours and stress. Circadian misalignment affects sleep architecture and the glucose-insulin metabolism, substrate oxidation, the HOMA-IR index, leptin concentrations and HPA-axis activity.

review article

24-h admission at the paediatric ward of the MUMC+. Anthropometric measurements, and blood sampling for assessment of insulin sensitivity was performed. Questionnaires on food intake behaviour, physical activity and sleep were completed, and polysomnography took place during an overnight stay at the paediatric ward.

Anthropometry
Body weight was measured with the subject in the fasted state, barefoot and in underwear. Weight was determined to the nearest 0.1 kg using a calibrated scale (Seca, Chino, CA, USA). Height was measured using a rigid wall-based digital stadiometer (De Grood Metaaltechniek, Nijmegen, Netherlands) using the Frankfurt plane method. BMI was calculated (BMI = body weight/height¬≤). Because of considerable changes of BMI during childhood and growth, the BMI was corrected for age and gender to obtain the BMI z-score. BMI z-scores were calculated with the lambda, mu, sigma (LMS) method in Growth Analyser software (Growth Analyser VE, Rotterdam, Netherlands). Furthermore, all children were classified as overweight, obese or morbidly obese according to the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) criteria.

Puberty
During adolescence, sleeping hours, physical activity and food intake behaviour may be related to the risk for insulin resistance. Puberty stage was determined using the Tanner G/M stages. Susman et al. showed that the 95% confidence interval of mean age in Tanner G/M stage 4 was 14.3 years for girls and 15.0 years for boys. Tanner stages were subsequently divided into three subgroups: prepubertal (Tanner G/M stage 1), peripubertal (Tanner G/M stages 2 and 3) and postpubertal (Tanner G/M stages 4 and 5).

Associations of Sleep Characteristics with IR
As very few studies have assessed relationships between sleep duration and IR during childhood and adolescence, further research is needed to specify these relationships. The following study was performed to specify the relationship between sleep characteristics and IR in overweight and obese adolescents, taking gender, puberty stage, BMI z-score, physical activity and food intake behaviour into account.

Subjects and Methods
Subjects were selected from the Centre for Overweight Adolescent and Children‚Äôs Healthcare (COACH) program in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria were: being overweight or obese, age between 10 and 18 years. Exclusion criteria were medical causes of overweight or obesity, such as hypothyroidism. Ethical approval was obtained from the medical ethics committee of the Maastricht University Medical Centre. All parents and children of 12 years and older gave informed consent for participation in the COACH program and use of study data for publication.

Insulin Sensitivity
Venous blood sampling was performed to analyse fasting glucose concentration and fasting insulin concentration. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by calculating the HOMA-IR. HOMA-IR is calculated as Glucose (mmol/l) √ó Insulin (pmol/l)/ 22.5.

Sleep Characteristics
Sleep was analysed using polysomnography. The polysomnographs yielded the following sleep stages: REM sleep, non-REM sleep stage N1, N2 and N3. A regular night of sleep consists of 4‚Äì5 cycles of these sleep stages, starting with n-REM stage N1 (drifting off to sleep), followed by N2 (light sleep), N3 (deep sleep) and REM sleep (dreaming sleep). Each sleep stage has a characteristic brain wave pattern, which makes it possible to differentiate each stage using polysomnography. Furthermore, TST, defined as total time spent sleeping, was determined. SE is the TST divided by the total time spent in bed. REM is the total time spent in rapid eye movement sleep. SWS is the amount of time spent in non-REM sleep phase N3. QS is (REM + SWS)/TST. # review article

## Physical Activity
Physical activity was assessed using a validated Dutch translation of the Baecke questionnaire for children. This questionnaire consists of 16 questions analysing three dimensions that were each scored on a 5-point scale. The following dimensions were assessed: physical activity at school (school index), physical activity during performing sports (sport index) and physical activity during leisure time (leisure time index).

Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficients were calculated in order to determine associations between insulin sensitivity and sleep parameters, anthropometry, Baecke scores, and food intake behaviour. Significant correlations were further examined using multiple linear regression analysis. Significant results from the regression analyses were combined to assess the association for the combined model. Results were considered significant when p-values were smaller than 0.05.

## Food Intake Behaviour
Food intake behaviour was assessed by a validated Dutch translation of the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire for children. This questionnaire consists of the factors cognitive restraint, disinhibition and hunger. Cognitive restraint refers to the conscious control over food intake. Disinhibition indicates the loss of control in response to disinhibiting stimuli, for example stress. Hunger measures the feeling of hunger in general.

## Statistical Analyses
Data were analysed using IBM spss statistics 19.0 software. Descriptive statistics were given as mean and standard deviation (SD). Factorial anova was used for comparison of means between genders.

## Results
One hundred and thirty-seven children (30.7% boys; 69.3% girls) were eligible for this study. Their characteristics age, BMI z-score, Cole classification and Tanner G/M stage are presented in Table 1. Fasting glucose concentration, insulin concentration and HOMA-IR are presented as factors of insulin sensitivity. The possible determinants of insulin sensitivity TST, QS, SE, REM sleep and SWS, as well as the three dimensions of the Baecke questionnaire (school index, sport index and leisure time index) and three dimensions of the TFEQ questionnaire (cognitive restraint, disinhibition and hunger) are also included in Table 1. In the present cohort, significant gender-related effects were observed with respect to Tanner stages, insulin concentrations, HOMA-IR and scores on the sport index of the Baecke questionnaire (Table 1).

Furthermore, significant differences were present between puberty stages. In girls, age, BMI z-score and Cole classification differed significantly between puberty stages. In boys, significant differences between puberty stages were present for insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR. As significant differences were found for gender and puberty, further multiple regression analyses are presented separately for gender and puberty stage.

Associations with Insulin Sensitivity (r2 = 0.33, p = 0.000) and puberty stage (r2 = 0.32, p = 0.000) were identified as significant contributors to HOMA-IR (Table 2a). The older boys, and those in a later puberty stage, had a higher IR. There were trends for BMI z-score (r2 = 0.11, p = 0.058) and Baecke total score (r2 = 0.12, p = 0.078), to contribute to the explained variance of HOMA-IR, but this did not reach significance. The combination of age, BMI z-score, puberty stage, and Baecke total score, explained 55% of the variance in HOMA-IR in boys in this cohort. Age, BMI z-score, and puberty stage were positively, and Baecke score was inversely associated with HOMA-IR.

In the girls, including all puberty stages, BMI z-score was identified as an independent contributor to HOMA-IR (r2 = 0.07, p = 0.018), explaining 7% of the variance in HOMA-IR (Table 2b). The girls with a higher BMI z-score had a higher IR. None of the other variables were identified as significant predictors of HOMA-IR in girls in this cohort.

In prepubertal girls, TST (r2 = 0.59, p = 0.02) was identified as an independent contributor to HOMA-IR, explaining 59% of variance (Table 2c). Also, SE (r2 = 0.58, p = 0.028) was identified as an independent contributor, explaining 58% of the variance in HOMA-IR in this group. Both were inversely associated with HOMA-IR.

sensitivity together with a decline in               ùõΩ-cell function resulting
in permanent pancreatic insufficiency and hyperglycaemia.
Thus, not all children with IR develop NIDDM. Identifying
those who do develop NIDDM early is of major importance
for further prevention and treatment.
Data from the presented cross-sectional study in overweight
and obese adolescent boys and girls at different puberty stages
show no transient, yet persistent IR during the three distin-
guished puberty stages. In the selected cohort, all children
and adolescents were admitted based upon their BMI z-scores
(Table 1). The results are considered separately for gender and
puberty stage.
In all girls together, HOMA-IR was positively related to BMI
z-score, which is in accordance with present literature. The postpubertal girls had a higher BMI z-score than the pre-
pubertal and the peripubertal girls, and HOMA-IR remained
persistently high postpubertally, in contrast with the usual con-
ditions, where postpubertally HOMA-IR drops again. In
all boys together, age and puberty stage were positively asso-
ciated with HOMA-IR, also confirming previous observations. In the boys, postpubertal HOMA-IR was higher com-
pared with the prepubertal figure. We suggest that in the
present cohort, the postpubertal boys and girls are at risk for
NIDDM, as their postpubertal HOMA-IR is persistently at an
elevated level.
The prepubertal girls showed inverse relations of HOMA-IR
with TST and SE. In acute studies, both SE and TST have been
positively related to insulin sensitivity. Longer TST may
be a protective factor for glucose tolerance and/or pancreatic
ùõΩ-cell compensation capacity. This finding is in accor-
dance with published studies that also show that inadequate
sleep duration, evaluated by sleep log or actigraphy, was signifi-
cantly associated with a higher risk for IR and hypergly-
caemia in children and adolescents. Strength of this study
is the vast collection of measured observational data, includ-
ing the polysomnography. A limitation is the relatively small

cohort, resulting in rather small subgroups. The data of this
cross-sectional study on overweight and obese children and
adolescents indicate primarily associations of age, BMI z-score,
and puberty stage with HOMA-IR, showing no transient, but
rather a persistent IR during puberty. We presume that this is
primarily due to the high BMI                z-scores of the adolescents. As
most of the associations of IR with lifestyle factors per puberty
stage appeared in the prepubertal girls, it is likely that a prepu-
bertal intervention promoting increase of TST and SE, as well
as a reduction of BMI            z-score may reduce the risk for persis-
tent IR. As all these children and adolescents are at risk for IR
during adulthood, this cohort will be followed up during an
intervention aiming to reduce BMI z-score, and longitudinal
data will be collected. Another interesting possibility for future
research is to assess the effects of diet and physical activity on
IR and sleep architecture in overweight and obese adolescents,
with a high HOMA-IR. This is currently being investigated
in the ‚ÄòPREVIEW‚Äô (PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle
Intervention and population studies in Europe and around the
World) study. This study consists of a 3-year randomized
control trial (RCT) in 2500 adults and 200 children, where the
high intensity physical activity on IR is being investigated. Fur-
thermore, the PREVIEW study will perform data analyses in
a large cohort of studies to assess the most successful com-
bination of diet and physical activity to prevent NIDDM in
pre-diabetic adolescents.
In summary, the transient IR that normally occurs during
puberty is at risk to become persistent IR, especially in obese
adolescents with an unfavourable fat partitioning, and with a
family history of NIDDM.
Determinants of IR in adolescents are suggested to be sleep-
ing hours, physical activity and food intake behaviour.
The data presented from a cohort of overweight and obese
adolescents at Maastricht University Medical Centre show an
increased risk for NIDDM, indicated by a persistently higher
HOMA-IR at each puberty stage. Then the main determinants
of HOMA-IR are BMI z-score, age, pubertal stage and prepu-
bertal SE and TST.
The latter is an important clinical finding, as it not only
suggests that sleep is a target for preventing insulin sensitivity
in overweight youth, but that the sleep interventions should be
staged early in puberty to assert maximum results.
