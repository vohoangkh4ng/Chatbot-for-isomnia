# Title: Social Jetlag and Its Association With Screen Time and Nighttime Texting Among Adolescents in Sweden: A Cross-Sectional Study

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between social jetlag, screen time, and nighttime texting among adolescents aged 13 to 15 in Sweden. It defines social jetlag as a discrepancy of more than 2 hours between bedtime and wake-up time on school days versus weekends. The research, which surveyed 1,518 students, found a prevalence of social jetlag at 53.9%. Results indicated that increased screen time and nighttime texting are significantly associated with social jetlag, suggesting that irregular sleep patterns may be linked to these behaviors. The study emphasizes the need for further research to explore causative factors and develop public health interventions addressing adolescent sleep issues.
