# Title: The Relation between Insomnia Symptoms, Mood, and Rumination about Insomnia Symptoms

## Summary: This article investigates the role of insomnia-specific rumination in relation to insomnia symptoms and mood. It presents findings from two distinct samples, one comprising nonclinical participants and the other consisting of individuals diagnosed with both Major Depressive Disorder and Insomnia. The study developed an insomnia-specific rumination measurement scale, which demonstrated high internal consistency. Results indicated that poor sleepers exhibited higher levels of rumination about daytime insomnia symptoms compared to good sleepers. Notably, insomnia rumination was found to predict insomnia independently of depression, suggesting that rumination-targeted treatments may be beneficial for individuals suffering from insomnia.
