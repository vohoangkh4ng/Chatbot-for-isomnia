# Title: The Hypothalamic Pituitary Thyroid Axis and Sleep

## Summary: This article explores the bidirectional relationship between sleep and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, highlighting how both systems are interdependent for optimal physiological functioning. It discusses how sleep quality and duration can influence the secretion patterns of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormones, with short-term sleep restriction leading to reduced nocturnal TSH secretion. Conversely, TSH and thyroid hormones also impact sleep architecture and quality. The review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the associations between the HPT axis and sleep patterns, suggesting that structural thyroid disorders may alter circadian rhythms, which requires further investigation.
