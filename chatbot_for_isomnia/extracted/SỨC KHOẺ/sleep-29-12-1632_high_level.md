# Title: Estimating Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) Phase in Adolescents Using Summer or School-Year Sleep/Wake Schedules

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) phase and self-selected sleep/wake patterns in children and adolescents during summer vacation and the school year. The research involved participants sleeping at home on their chosen schedules and reporting their sleep times. Results indicated that sleep patterns, including bedtime and wake-up time, were positively correlated with DLMO phase, allowing for accurate estimation of DLMO phase within Â±1 hour in approximately 80% of cases for both summer and school groups. The findings suggest that self-reported sleep/wake behaviors can effectively estimate intrinsic circadian parameters in healthy adolescents.
