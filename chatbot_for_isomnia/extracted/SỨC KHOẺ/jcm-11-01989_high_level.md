# Title: Insomnia Symptoms, Sleep Hygiene, Mental Health, and Academic Performance in Spanish University Students: A Cross-Sectional Study

## Summary: This study investigates the prevalence of insomnia symptoms among university students and explores the relationship between insomnia, health habits, mental health, and academic performance. Conducted with 582 students from the University of Granada, the research utilized various validated instruments to assess insomnia and related factors. Findings indicate a high prevalence of insomnia symptoms (39.7%) and identify depression, sleep hygiene, stress, and anxiety as significant predictors of insomnia. The results suggest that poor sleep hygiene and mental health issues are risk factors for insomnia, which negatively impacts academic performance, highlighting the need for interventions to promote better sleep and mental health among students.
