# Associations of frequent pain symptoms with excessive daytime sleepiness in adolescents: a longitudinal study

## Study Objectives
Pain symptoms, sleep disturbance, and daytime sleepiness are common in adolescents. This study examined the cross-sectional and prospective associations between pain symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in a large sample of adolescents.

## Methods
Participants were 7,072 adolescents (mean age = 14.58 years) in a follow-up study of behavior and health in Shandong, China. A self-administered structured questionnaire was used to assess pain symptoms (headache, stomachache, and other general pain), body weight and height, sleep, anxiety/depression, substance use, and family environment in November–December in 2015 and 1 year later. The Chinese adolescent daytime sleepiness scale was used to measure daytime sleepiness.

## Results
Of the sample, 19.8% and 23.2% had moderate or severe EDS at baseline and at 1-year follow-up, respectively. The prevalence and 1-year incidence rates of EDS significantly increased with the frequencies of pain symptoms. Frequent pain was significantly associated with increased risk of EDS at baseline (odds ratio = 2.01, 95% confidence interval = 1.56–2.59), incident EDS (odds ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence interval = 1.03–1.93), and persistent EDS (odds ratio = 2.17, 95% confidence interval = 1.52–3.09) while adjusting for adolescent and family covariates, including anxiety/depression, nocturnal sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, frequent snoring, body mass index, and hypnotic use. Similar associations were observed across headache, stomachache, and other pain.

## Conclusions
Frequent pain is significantly and independently associated with increased risk of EDS. Our findings suggest that assessing and treating pain symptoms is important to improve healthy sleep and reduce risk of EDS in adolescents. Further research is needed to understand the underlying psychological and neurobiological mechanisms between pain and daytime sleepiness in adolescents.

## BRIEF SUMMARY
**Current Knowledge/Study Rationale:** Chronic pain, sleep disturbance, and daytime sleepiness are prevalent in adolescents. Data on the prospective association between pain and excessive daytime sleepiness in the general population of adolescents are scarce.
**Study Impact:** This longitudinal study of 7,072 Chinese adolescents found that frequent pain was significantly associated with increased risk of incident and persistent excessive daytime sleepiness over 1-year follow-up. The associations remained significant even after adjustment for sleep duration, insomnia, and anxiety/depression. These findings underscore the importance of assessing and treating pain to improve healthy sleep and reduce risk of excessive daytime sleepiness in adolescents.

## INTRODUCTION
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that most adolescents sleep less than 8 hours per night on weekdays, have difficulty initiating sleep, and 20–40% report excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Insufficient sleep, sleep disturbance, and EDS in adolescents have a range of adverse health and psychosocial outcomes, including but not limited to obesity, substance use, self-harm, accidents, behavioral and emotional problems, impaired daily functioning, and poor school performance.
Sleep regulation and disturbance during adolescence is related to developmental, biological, psychosocial, school, and family factors. EDS is the tendency to fall asleep during normal waking hours. While insufficient sleep is the most common cause of EDS, there are a number of extrinsic factors (eg, digital media use, watching television, video games, homework, extracurricular activities, social interaction, jobs, caffeinated beverage use before bedtime, irregular sleep schedules, early school start) and intrinsic/biological factors (eg, puberty development, insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorder, sleep-related breathing disorders, narcolepsy) that may lead to EDS among adolescents.
Identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial to provide information on potential targets for intervention to promote healthy sleep and prevent EDS in adolescents. One of the potentially manageable risk factors is chronic/recurrent pain.
Pain is one of the most common somatic complaints in children and adolescents. The median prevalence rate of chronic pain. Chronic pain and adolescent daytime sleepiness

in pediatric populations is estimated to range from 11% to 38%,
with headache, abdominal pain, and musculoskeletal pain being
the most common types of pain. Chronic pain caused by uniden-
tified medical conditions begins to increase from age 12 years and
is more prevalent in girls than in boys. Growing evi-

dence suggests that chronic pain is associated with sleep distur-
bances, short sleep duration, and daytime sleepiness in the
pediatric population and that more than half of pediatric patients
with chronic pain report disturbed sleep. However, the
majority of epidemiological studies of chronic pain and sleep dis-
turbance in pediatric populations are cross-sectional or case-
control design. Furthermore, existing prospective studies
on the impact of chronic pain on sleep are mostly conducted in
specific pediatric pain populations and their findings are
mixed. Although some clinical studies have reported that
daytime sleepiness is more prevalent in adolescents with chronic
pain vs healthy controls, to our knowledge, no prospective
population-based studies have specifically investigated the asso-
ciations between pain symptoms and EDS in adolescents.
The current longitudinal study of a large sample of Chinese
adolescents (n = 7,072) was conducted to address the following
questions. First, is frequent pain significantly associated with
increased risk of EDS by cross-sectional baseline data analysis?
Second, does frequent pain predict incident and persistent EDS
over 1-year follow-up? Third, is the association between frequent
pain and EDS independent of nocturnal sleep duration and insom-
nia, although pain often interferes with sleep initiation and restor-
ative sleep and makes a person prone to drowsiness? Finally, does
EDS vary across pain conditions (ie, headaches, stomachache or
abdominal pain, or other nonspecific pain)?

METHODS
Participants and procedure
Participants were 7,072 adolescents who were resurveyed 1 year
later in the Shandong Adolescent Behavior & Health Cohort
study in Shandong, China. Detailed sampling and data collection
methods have been described elsewhere. In brief, partici-
pants were sampled from 5 middle and 3 high schools in 3 counties
of Shandong, with consideration of the representativeness of ado-
lescent students in the region, prior study collaboration, conve-
nience, and budget.
Baseline survey was conducted in 7–11th graders in
November–December 2015 (n = 11,831). All 7th, 8th, and 10th
graders at baseline were invited to participate in a follow-up sur-
vey 1 year later in 2016. A self-administered, structured ques-
tionnaire was used to assess pain symptoms, sleep, mental health,
psychosocial factors, and family environment. After getting per-
mission from the target schools, trained public health workers
administered the questionnaire to participants in their classrooms
during regular school hours. Before filling out the questionnaire,
participants were asked to read the instruction carefully, includ-
ing the purpose of the survey and how to answer the questions.
They were also informed that the survey was anonymous, and
their participation was voluntary. We obtained permission to con-
duct the study from the principals in the target schools and
informed consent from participants before the survey. The study
was approved by the research ethics committee of Shandong Uni-

versity School of Public Health and target schools.

Measures
The following measures included in the questionnaire were used
to assess dependent and independent variables and covariates for
the current study,

Excessive daytime sleepiness
The Chinese Adolescent Daytime Sleepiness Scale (CADSS)
was used to assess EDS at baseline and 1-year later. The CADSS
consists of 7 questions that ask about adolescents’ general feeling
of drowsiness and dozing off at different situations during the
daytime in the past month. Example items are “During the past
month, how often would you say you feel sleepy during the
day?” “During the past month, how often would you say you
have dozed off in the morning classes?”, and “During the past
month, how often would you say you have dozed off while reading
or doing homework?” All the 7 items can be found in Liu et al. Each item is rated on a Likert scale from 1 = never to 5 = almost
every day. Summing up the scores of the 7 items yields a total
CADSS score, ranging from 7 to 35. A total score of 23 has
been suggested as a cutoff of moderate or severe daytime sleepi-
ness or EDS during the past month. Incident EDS was defined
as the occurrence of new EDS (ie, CADSS score ≥ 23) at 1-year
follow-up among adolescents without EDS at baseline. Persistent
EDS was defined as the prevalence of EDS (ie, CADSS score ≥
23) at both baseline and 1 year later. The CADSS has satisfactory
psychometric properties. Cronbach’s alpha with the current
sample was 0.89 at baseline and 0.91 at 1-year follow-up.
Pain symptoms at baseline
Pain symptoms without known medical causes were assessed by 3
items in the Youth Self-Report somatic complaints subscale:
headache, stomachache/abdominal pain, and other nonspecific
pain (aches or pains except for stomachache or headache). Each pain item is rated on a 3-point scale: “0” = not true, “1” =
somewhat or sometimes true, and “2” = very true or often true dur-
ing the past 6 months. Frequent pain was defined by the presence
of any of the 3 pain symptoms as “very true” or “often true” during
the past 6 months. The Chinese Youth Self-Report has been
reported to have satisfactory psychometric properties.
Sleep duration and sleep problems at baseline

Nocturnal sleep duration on weekdays was assessed by the ques-
tion: During the past month, on a typical school day, how many
hours of actual sleep did you get at night? Frequent snoring was
evaluated by the question with an answer of at least 3 times/
week: During the past month, how often did you snore loudly?
Hypnotic use was assessed by the question: During the past
month, how often did you take medicine to help sleep?
Insomnia was assessed by the Youth Self-Rating Insomnia
Scale (YSIS). The YSIS consists of 8 items that assess insomnia
symptoms and waking symptoms or daytime consequences
within the past month. The symptoms assessed include difficulty
initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early morning
awakening, unrefreshing sleep, poor sleep quality, sleep insufficiency, sleep dissatisfaction, and interference of sleep disturbance with daytime functioning. Example items are “During the past month, how often would you say you feel difficulty falling asleep?” “During the past month, how often would you say you have insufficient sleep?” All the 8 items can be found in Liu et al. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (never) to 5 (almost every day). Summing the scores on the 8 items yields a total YSIS score ranging from 8 to 40. A higher total score of the YSIS indicates a greater insomnia severity during the past month. A total score of 26 has been suggested as a cutoff of moderate or severe insomnia. The YSIS has been demonstrated to have acceptable psychometric properties in Chinese adolescents. Cronbach’s alpha for the sample was 0.80.

Anxious/depressive symptoms at baseline

The Chinese Youth Self-Report of Achenbach’s Child Behavior Checklist was used to measure anxious/depressive symptoms. The Youth Self-Report anxious/depressed subscale consists of 16 items that can be found in the Manual for the Youth Self-Report. Each item is rated on a 3-point scale: “0” = not true, “1” = somewhat or sometimes true, and “2” = very true or often true. Summing up the scores of the 16 items yields a total depressive score. A total score > 14 has been suggested as cutoff to define clinically relevant anxious/depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents. Cronbach’s alpha with the present sample was 0.88 for the subscale.

Other adolescent and family covariates at baseline

Other adolescent factors included in the study as covariates were age, sex, body mass index calculated based on self-reported body weight and height, chronic diseases (yes or no), ever cigarette smoking (yes or no), ever alcohol drinking (yes or no), and the school that participants were attending (7 dummy variables for 8 schools). Family covariates were father’s education and occupation, self-reported family economic status, and interparental relationship (Table 1). Mother’s education and occupation were not included because family social economic status is more likely to be determined by father’s education and occupation in traditional Chinese culture.

Statistical analysis

Sample characteristics at baseline were described by proportion (%) for categorical variables and mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables. Chi-square tests were performed to examine the differences in the rates of EDS across the 3 pain symptoms (ie, headache, stomachache/abdominal pain, and other pain) and any pain (ie, presence of any of the 3 pain symptoms). A series of logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations of pain symptoms with EDS at baseline and at 1-year follow-up, respectively. Model 1 was performed to examine the bivariate associations between pain symptoms and EDS. Model 2 was performed to examine the adjusted associations between pain symptoms and EDS while controlling for adolescent and family covariates except for sleep duration and insomnia in Table 1. Model 3 was performed to examine the adjusted associations between pain symptoms and EDS while controlling for adolescent and family covariates in Model 2 plus sleep duration and insomnia. Same analyses were performed for adolescents with persistent EDS (ie, CADSS score ≥ 23 at both baseline and 1 year later). In addition, interactions of pain symptoms by sex on EDS were examined with logistic regression analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).

RESULTS

Among 8,629 7th–8th graders and 10th graders at baseline, 7,072 were resurveyed, with a follow-up rate of 82.0%. Mean age of the sample at baseline was 14.58 (standard deviation = 1.45) and about half were female. Table 1 presents detailed adolescent and family characteristics of the sample at baseline.

Prevalence of pain symptoms and EDS

As shown in Table 1, approximately 45% and 8% adolescents reported having pain symptoms sometimes and often over the past 6 months, respectively. Headache was most prevalent, with 36.6% and 4.6% being sometimes and often, respectively. Of the sample, 19.8% and 23.2% had EDS at baseline and at 1-year follow-up, respectively. Among 5,670 adolescents without EDS at baseline, 927 (16.3%) developed EDS at 1-year follow-up. Among 1,402 adolescents who had EDS at baseline, 715 (51.0%) still had EDS at 1-year follow-up, and 687 (49.0%) did not have EDS. As can be seen from Figure 1, the rates of EDS at baseline and 1-year follow-up significantly increased with the frequency of all the 3 pain symptoms at baseline (all P < .05). For example, the prevalence of EDS at baseline increased from 16.5% in adolescents who did not report headache at baseline to 42.7% in those who reported frequent headache, the incidence rate of EDS at 1-year follow-up increased from 15.1 to 28.9%, and the rate of persistent EDS increased from 10.5 to 38.5%. Similar tendency was observed between boys and girls (ie, the rates of EDS increased with pain symptoms for both boys and girls).

Cross-sectional associations of EDS with pain symptoms at baseline

Table 2 presents the odds ratios (ORs) of EDS in relation to pain symptoms at baseline. Univariate logistic regressions (Model 1) showed that adolescents who reported any of the 3 pain symptoms sometimes and often were 1.38–1.69 and 3.61–3.80 times more likely to have EDS, respectively (all P < .001). After adjusting for adolescent and family covariates (Model 2), all ORs were reduced to a limited degree and were still significant except for any pain sometimes. With additional adjustment of sleep duration and insomnia (Model 3), the ORs were further reduced but still tended to increase with advancing frequency of pain symptoms, and the ORs for frequent pain symptoms all remained statistically significant. Illustratively, frequent pain was significantly associated with about 2-fold risk increase of EDS (OR = 2.17 [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.57–2.99 for headache, OR = 1.87 [95% Chronic pain and adolescent daytime sleepiness

Associations of persistent EDS with baseline pain symptoms

The analysis was limited to adolescents who had EDS at baseline and 1-year follow-up compared with those adolescents without EDS at either baseline or follow-up. Table 4 presents the ORs of persistent EDS with pain symptoms at baseline. Model 1 showed that adolescents who reported headache, stomachache, or other pain sometimes and frequent were significantly at increased risk of persistent EDS. After adjusting for adolescent and family covariates (Model 2), all ORs became smaller, but they were still significant except for headache sometimes. With additional adjustment of sleep duration and insomnia (Model 3), albeit all ORs were further reduced, frequent headache, stomachache, other pain, and any pain were still significantly associated with increased risk of persistent EDS.

There were no significant interactions of pain symptoms by sex on EDS in the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.

DISCUSSION

Pain symptoms and daytime sleepiness are both common in adolescents. Little is known about the prospective association between pain symptoms and EDS in the general adolescent population. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of pain symptoms and EDS in a large sample of Chinese adolescent students (n = 7,072). Our major findings are summarized and discussed below.

Regardless of the type of pain symptoms, the prevalence and subsequent incidence rates of EDS significantly increased with the frequency of pain symptoms at baseline. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that frequent pain at baseline was significantly associated approximately 40% increased risk of incident EDS.

1.03–1.93) and 2-fold risk of persistent EDS (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.52–3.09), independent of sex, age, substance use, anxiety/depression, body mass index, frequent snoring, sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep medication use. Our findings support previous clinical studies that show that adolescents with pain are more likely to have daytime sleepiness.

The mechanisms between pain symptoms and EDS during adolescence are not clear but can be understood within a biopsychosocial and developmental framework. Adolescence is a period from puberty to adulthood, along with marked physical and psychosocial developmental changes and increased risk of behavioral, emotional, and sleep problems. Developmental changes in sleep-wake regulation and sleep patterns are characterized as reduced time in slow-wave sleep and latency to rapid eye movement sleep and a preference for a delayed sleep phase during adolescence. These sleep changes are attributed to the misalignment of endogenous circadian rhythms, puberty-related phase delay, and psychosocial developmental needs (such as, heavy homework, night social activities, and early Chronic pain and adolescent daytime sleepiness

These psychosocial needs and developmental changes are a source of stress, and stress results in mood dysregulation, pain, impaired sleep, and daytime sleepiness. There are several potential pathways to explain the pain-EDS link during adolescence. First, pain itself often interferes with sleep initiation and restorative sleep, which can cause sleep Chronic pain and adolescent daytime sleepiness

loss and use of sleep pills and then results in EDS. Second, pain can cause anxiety/depression, which in turn results in sleep disturbance and EDS. However, the associations observed in the study cannot be fully explained by sleep problems and anxiety/depression because these associations were only reduced to a moderate extent after controlling for sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, use of sleep pills, and anxiety/depression. Third, pain can cause circadian misalignment and disrupted sleep–wake cycles and then lead to EDS. Furthermore, although use of pain medications for pain relief was not surveyed in the study, some medications such as aspirin and ibuprofen could impact sleep quantity and sleep efficiency, possibly leading to sleep loss and EDS. On the other hand, some pain medications such as anticonvulsants (eg, gabapentin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine) and tricyclic antidepressants (eg, imipramine, amitriptyline) often have a sedating effect and increase risk of EDS.

Biologically, neurobiological mechanisms may play a role in the relationship between pain and EDS. For example, both chronic pain conditions and daytime sleepiness are linked to reduced concentrations or hypoactivities of serotonin and blunted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activities. Growing studies have also shown that melatonin plays important roles in sleep-wake regulation and pain modulation through multiple mechanisms.

Furthermore, orexin, a neuropeptide involved in the regulation of arousal, wake–sleep cycle, has recently been demonstrated to be involved in neuropathic and visceral nociception, headache, orofacial pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and stress induced analgesia.

According to a recent literature review, self-reported sleep disturbances, including shorter sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and poor sleep quality, are more likely to occur in youth with headache or migraine than healthy peers. In the current study, we did not find the risk of EDS being specific to any pain symptoms (ie, headache, stomachache/abdominal pain, and other pain), although the ORs of EDS somewhat differed across the 3 types of pain. Further research is warranted to examine the prospective associations and biological mechanisms between different types of pain and sleep problems in adolescents.

The study has several strengths. First, the longitudinal study of a large sample of adolescents (n = 7,072) allows us to look at the associations of the 3 common pain symptoms with EDS over time. Second, EDS was assessed by a valid scale, with satisfactory psychometric properties in Chinese adolescents. Third, large sample size allows us to adjust for multiple potential adolescent and family confounders such as anxiety/depression, snoring, sleep duration, and insomnia to examine the independent associations between pain symptoms and EDS.

The findings need to be interpreted considering the following limitations. First, all data were assessed by self-report, which may have led to biased reporting of pain and EDS. Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Self-report is the most common method to assess self-reported pain frequency and intensity. Objective measures of sleep duration and sleep problems such as actigraphy and electroencephalography are desirable, but self-reports. Chronic pain and adolescent daytime sleepiness

remain as the typical method in large-scale epidemiological stud-
ies. Second, although CADSS has demonstrated satisfactory reli-
ability and validity in Chinese adolescents, further validation
with objective assessment like multiple sleep latency test is
needed. Third, EDS was assessed at baseline and 1 year later. It
is unknown if EDS had any changes during the period from base-

line survey to 1-year follow-up survey. Persistent EDS and recur-
rent EDS could not be differentiated. Third, we did not have
information about pain history, pain characteristics (eg, intensity
and duration), pain tolerance, and pain medications used, all of
which may have different impacts on sleep and daytime sleepi-
ness. Fourth, although the sample size is large, partici-
pants were sampled from 8 schools in 1 province of China, the
findings from the sample may not be generalized to other adoles-
cent populations because both pain and sleep in pediatric
populations are influenced by psychosocial, cultural, and envi-
ronmental factors. For example, nearly 40% of participants in
the current study were drawn from families where fathers were
farmers. Adolescent students in China have a busy school sched-
ule, heavy homework load, have to go to school in the early morn-
ing, stay up late, and study on the weekend to enter top
universities.

All these factors may have influence on the pain-sleep/daytime sleepiness link. Future longitudinal research considering pain intensity and location, clinical/objective assess-
ments of sleep, and cultural and school factors in diverse adoles-
cent populations is warranted.
In summary, our study of a large sample of adolescents pro-
vides evidence that EDS is more prevalent in adolescents with
pain symptoms and that pain symptoms appear to be a significant
and independent predictor of EDS. Although further research is
needed to clarify the exact nature of the relationship between
pain and EDS, these findings underscore the importance of
assessing and treating pain in the prevention and intervention
of sleep disturbance/EDS because pain, sleep disturbance, and
EDS are common in adolescents. Comprehensive assessments
and management of pain symptoms, sleep disturbances, and
EDS should be incorporated into routine health care of adoles-
cents. Further research is needed to investigate the underlying
psychosocial, developmental, pathophysiological, and neurobi-
ological mechanisms between pain, sleep, and daytime sleepi-
ness in adolescents. Further research is also needed to
understand the reciprocal influence of inadequate sleep on the
pain experience.
