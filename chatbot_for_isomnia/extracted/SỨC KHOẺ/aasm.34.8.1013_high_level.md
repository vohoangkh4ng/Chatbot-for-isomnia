# Title: The Association between Use of Mobile Phones after Lights Out and Sleep Disturbances among Japanese Adolescents: A Nationwide Cross-Sectional Survey

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between mobile phone use after lights out and sleep disturbances in Japanese adolescents. Conducted as a nationwide cross-sectional survey, it involved 95,680 participants from junior and senior high schools. The findings indicate that daily mobile phone use, particularly for calling and texting after lights out, is linked to various sleep issues, including short sleep duration, poor sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and insomnia symptoms. The study highlights the need for further research to develop effective sleep hygiene strategies, despite noting some limitations in effect sizes.
