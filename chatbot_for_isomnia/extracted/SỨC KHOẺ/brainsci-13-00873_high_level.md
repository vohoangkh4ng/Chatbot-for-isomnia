# Title: Dietary Intake of Flavonoids Associated with Sleep Problems: An Analysis of Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007â€“2010

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between daily flavonoid intake and sleep duration, as well as sleep disorders, using data from 8,216 participants aged 20 and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2007 and 2010. The study employs logistic regression to assess the associations and finds that certain flavonoids, such as anthocyanidins and flavan-3-ols, are linked to increased sleep duration and a reduced risk of sleep problems. The research suggests that flavonoids may serve as a preventive factor for sleep disorders, highlighting significant interactions with factors like race/ethnicity and education level.
