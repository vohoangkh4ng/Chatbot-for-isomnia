# Title: Sleep Deprivation Triggers Cognitive Control Impairments in Task-Goal Switching

## Summary: This study investigates the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on task-goal switching, a crucial aspect of cognitive flexibility. The research involved testing participants' performance on task-goal switching after a night of regular sleep versus total sleep deprivation. Results indicate that SD negatively impacts task-goal switching and other attentional and inhibition measures, while not affecting working memory. Notably, changes in task-goal switching were not linked to fatigue or sleepiness levels. This study highlights the differentiated effects of SD on executive functions and underscores the importance of cognitive flexibility in adapting to changing environments, particularly in the context of increasing sleep debt in modern society.
