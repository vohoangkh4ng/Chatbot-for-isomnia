# Title: Melatonin use and the risk of self-harm and unintentional injuries in youths with and without psychiatric disorders

## Summary: This study investigates the association between melatonin treatment and the risk of self-harm and unintentional injuries in youths aged 6 to 18. It analyzes data from a population-based cohort of 25,575 youths who initiated melatonin treatment, using Poisson regression to assess injury rates before and after treatment. The findings indicate that while the risk of body injuries and accidents remained stable, the risk of self-harm decreased significantly following melatonin initiation, particularly among adolescents with depression and anxiety. The results suggest that sleep interventions, such as melatonin, may help reduce self-harm risks in this vulnerable population.
