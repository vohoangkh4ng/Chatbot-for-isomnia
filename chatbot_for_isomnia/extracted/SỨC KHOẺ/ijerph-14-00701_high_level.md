# Title: Association between Excessive Use of Mobile Phone and Insomnia and Depression among Japanese Adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between mobile phone use and insomnia and depression in Japanese adolescents. Conducted with 295 high school students aged 15â€“19, the research found that excessive mobile phone use (over 5 hours per day) is linked to shorter sleep duration and increased insomnia risk, while mobile phone use for social networking and online chats is associated with a higher risk of depression. The findings suggest that mobile phone overuse can negatively impact sleep habits and mental health among adolescents.
