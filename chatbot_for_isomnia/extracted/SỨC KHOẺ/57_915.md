Subjective sleep duration and quality influence diet composition and circulating adipocytokines and ghrelin levels in teen-age girls

Abstract. Understanding the interplay between sleep duration and quality, diet and hormones of obesity may help design effective lifestyle intervention strategies. Here we studied such associations in lean and obese teen-aged Saudi girls. In this cross-sectional observational study, 126 girls (62 lean and 64 obese) aged 14 -18 years (16.5 ± 1.5) were evaluated. A general questionnaire, which included sleep and diet questions, was obtained and anthropometric measurements and overnight fasting blood samples for determination of glucose, lipid profile and serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, resistin and ghrelin were collected. Subjects that slept < 5 hours/day had a higher percent of carbohydrate intake (p = 0.04) than those who slept > 7 hours/day. Adiponectin levels were higher in the lean than the obese group and increased in proportion to hours of sleep. Ghrelin had an inverse association with subjective sleep duration (p = 0.04), while resistin levels were directly proportional to it. Thus, the duration and quality of sleep influenced diet composition and the circulating levels of adipocytokines and ghrelin in adolescent girls. Long and uninterrupted sleep was associated with a better diet and a more favorable hormonal profile.

Childhood obesity is a growing epidemic in industrialized and developing nations. In Saudi Arabia, one in every six children aged 6 to 18 years old is obese. Child and adolescent obesity have been associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases later in life, as well as with diabetes mellitus type 2, and cancer. Generally, there are proportionately more overweight girls than boys, particularly among adolescents. Specifically, epidemiological studies carried out in Saudi Arabia pointed to an increased incidence of overweight and obesity in Saudi children girls.

Adipose tissue is not just a passive energy storage depot, but an active endocrine organ with high metabolic and secretory activity that plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, insulin sensitivity and lipid/carbohydrate metabolism. Adipocytes produce and secrete several proteins that act as classic hormones; collectively called adipokines or adipocytokines, these substances play important roles in metabolic, inflammatory and atherosclerotic processes. Considering the potential pathophysiological roles of these adipocytokines in the epidemic of obesity and associated disorders, it is important to fully understand the factors that control their patterns of release.

Total energy intake and macronutrient composition of diet have been associated with varying concentrations of adipocytokines and ghrelin, a gastric hunger-stimulating hormone. The two key opposing hormones in appetite regulation, leptin and ghrelin, also play significant roles in the interaction between short sleep duration and high body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, sleep deprivation associated with activation of the stress system tem in healthy young adults has been shown to be as-
sociated with reduced leptin and elevated ghrelin lev-
els, a combination that increases appetite and results
in increased weight gain and obesity.

The objectives of this study were to determine se-

rum adipocytokine and ghrelin levels in lean and
obese teen-age Saudi girls, and study the associa-
tions between the serum levels of these hormones with
sleeping duration and quality patterns and daily intake
and composition of calories.

Methods
In this cross-sectional study, a total of 126 teen-aged
Saudi girls (14-18 years old), 62 lean and 64 obese,
were studied. Subjects were randomly selected from
secondary and intermediate levels of public schools of
different areas of Riyadh. The study was carried out at
King Saud University Diabetes Center, Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. Subjects included were free from diabetes,
hypertension, history of cardiac, kidney or liver dis-
ease, use of medications known to affect body weight
(e.g., steroids), and use of anorectic agents in the pri-
or 6 months. Written consents from the subjects and
their parents were obtained before inclusion. Ethical
approval was obtained from the College of Medicine
Research Center Ethics Committee, King Saud
University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).

Data collection
Participants answered a pre-designed Arabic ques-
tionnaire that was developed, pre-tested and validated
in a pilot study. This questionnaire was developed by
Asst. Professor L. Khanam, one of the authors from
the Dept. of Community Health Sciences, College
of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University,
Riyadh, KSA. It consisted of four parts: sociodemo-
graphic data, medical history, dietary assessment, and
questions regarding the subjective total sleep time
(TST, defined as the subjective number of sleep hours
in one day), which was divided into three categories (<
5 hours, 5-7 hours, > 7 hours) and sleep pattern (con-
tinuous or intermittent). Dietary intake was assessed
using a 24-hour food recall method and food frequen-
cy questionnaire in an attempt to provide a reliable
method to estimate the usual food intake. Face-to-
face standard interview was done with the subjects in-
stead of the conventional self-administered question-
naire to ensure validity, reliability and replicability.

Anthropometrics
Weight was recorded to the nearest 0.2 Kg using
an international standard scale (Digital Person Scale,
ADAM Equipment Inc., USA). Height was recorded
to the nearest 0.5 cm using the same scale. BMI was
calculated as kg/m2, and classified as lean or obese de-
pending on BMI for age and gender. Waist and
hip circumferences were measured by non-stretch-
able tape measure, and recorded to the nearest 0.1cm.
Tricipital and forethigh skin fold thickness were mea-
sured using the digital skin fold caliper (GIMA).

Biochemical assessment
Blood was withdrawn after an overnight fast (> 10
hours) and collected in non-heparinized test tubes.
Fasting serum glucose and lipid profile were mea-
sured using routine laboratory procedures (Konelab,
Finland). Adiponectin and resistin were measured us-
ing the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent as-
say (ELISA) by Linco; leptin using ELISA; and insulin
by solid phase enzyme amplified sensitivity immuno-
assay. Serum quantification of human ghrelin (active form)
was measured by ELISA with a minimum detectable range of 8 pg/mL. The
acylated, active form of ghrelin was measured, since
it is the one that mediates appetite regulation. Insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated as = fasting
insulin (IμU/mL) x fasting glucose (mmol/L) /22.5. All biochemical estimations were carried out
in the Biomarker Research Program of King Saud
University, Riyadh, KSA.

Statistical analysis
Data was analyzed using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS version
11.5, Chicago, IL, USA) and expressed as mean and
standard deviation (SD). Independent Student t-test
was used to compare variables normally distribut-
ed. Mann-Whitney U tests for variables otherwise.
Linear regression analysis was used to specify rela-
tions between two continuous variables. Pearson cor-
relation coefficient was used to determine associa-
tions between categorical and continuous variables.
Significance was set at p < 0.05. Sleep, diet, adipocytokines and ghrelin

Results

Table 1 shows that participants taking > 1700 kcal/day were significantly older than participants consuming ≤ 1700 kcal/day regardless of their BMI status. Furthermore, there was no significant effect of different caloric intake on serum lipid profile, insulin, HOMA-IR and the adipocytokines leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, whereas ghrelin showed a significant increase with increased calorie intake in lean subjects, while no such effect was observed in obese individuals (Table 2).

Effect of subjective sleep duration and pattern

Subjects sleeping < 5 hours/day showed a signifi- cantly higher percent of carbohydrate intake and significantly lower percent of fat intake from their total daily energy intake than those sleeping Energy intake (kcal/day) according to sleeping hours.

Adiponectin levels increased in proportion to hours of sleep, and were more pronounced in the lean group (Fig. 3).

discussion

Epidemiological data highlighted a significant association of chronic sleep deprivation to weight gain among adults, as evidenced by the parallel growth of obesity. Chronic sleep loss alters several metabolic parameters which predispose an individual to develop insulin resistance and eventually diabetes mellitus type 2. However, very few studies have been done in adolescents.

Leptin
Diminished and disturbed sleep are independently associated with obesity in adults, related to reduced circulating leptin level relative to their fat mass. Low leptin associated with sleep loss has a greater impact on appetite than high leptin levels, and is associated with leptin resistance in obesity. Although no significant changes were observed in the serum leptin levels in terms of sleeping hours, appetite for calorie dense foods with high carbohydrate content was significantly increased in subjects with short or intermittent compared to those with extended, continuous sleep, as previously shown in young adult men. These alterations in appetite regulation due to sleep restriction may reflect a normal adaptation to the increased caloric need associated with extended wakefulness.

Adiponectin
Sleep duration and pattern did not significantly influence levels of adiponectin among our subjects, consistent with a lack of a significant circadian rhythm of adiponectin, as compared to other hormones. Nevertheless, we suggest that normal to long sleeping hours are beneficial in terms of reducing insulin Sleep, diet, adipocytokines and ghrelin

resistance and improving insulin sensitivity. Possible mechanisms include the accumulation of “sleep debt”, which decreases sympathetic output and metabolic rate and, hence, causes appetite dysregulation leading to weight gain. Both mechanisms promote insulin resistance, a key factor in the down regulation of adiponectin.

Ghrelin
Ghrelin levels were negatively associated with sleep duration, which confirms the findings of Taheri et al. In adult circadian rhythm studies, circulating ghrelin was positively regulated by fluxes in overall energy balance. This explains both the gradual rise of basal levels throughout the day and the fall at night, as humans experience the serial alternating circadian states of positive (day) followed by negative (night) energy balance. There is an increased parasympathetic tone during sleep, but this cannot fully explain why there is increased ghrelin secretion during this period. Nocturnal ghrelin levels are affected by sleep duration as evidenced by the negative correlation to stage 1 sleep, which corresponds to light sleep. Furthermore, both ghrelin and growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) promote sleep and are co-factors in sleep regulation, which explains our finding of a positive correlation between ghrelin levels and continuous sleep.

Resistin
It is interesting to note that the profile of resistin was similar to that of adiponectin, even though the former counteracts the action of the latter. Resistin was negatively associated with ghrelin, which showed a similar trend with adiponectin with regards to sleeping hours. Various peripheral tissues show circadian rhythmicity, which is generated at the cellular level by their own core oscillators that are composed of transcriptional/translational feedback loops involving a set of clock genes that are highly conserved and function in interrelated regulatory networks. This finding has to be confirmed by using a larger sample size since the only data available are in mice.

Caloric intake and adipocytokine and ghrelin levels
Our results did not show significant correlations between adipocytokine levels and estimated calorie and macronutrient intake, a finding different from that of De Luis et al., which showed that weight loss secondary to a hypocaloric diet decreased leptin levels after treatment. In obese children, low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet-induced weight loss caused a significant change in leptin and adiponectin levels. Serum adiponectin levels rise in response to chronic caloric restriction in rodents. Moreover, weight reduction achieved by moderate calorie restriction increases plasma adiponectin in nondiabetic and diabetic patients, and healthy individuals.
Our results suggest that partial sleep deprivation is associated with increased levels of ghrelin and increased subjective ratings of hunger and appetite. Sleep restriction was associated with increased hunger and appetite, especially for foods with high carbohydrate content, consistent with epidemiological data that showed an association between short sleep duration and irregular eating habits, snacking between meals, excessive food seasoning and reduced consumption of vegetables.
The authors acknowledge limitations. First, the cross-sectional approach made it difficult to determine the true effect of sleep duration and dietary consumption to the various hormones. A prospective approach using an experimental setting will give more definite results. Second, there was the subjectiveness of the sleep duration and quality and food frequency questionnaire. Individuals may consciously or unconsciously overestimate or underestimate their sleep duration and nutrient intakes. Finally, the findings are limited to the adolescent girl population. A study of adolescent boys will be necessary considering that most of the hormones studied are influenced by gender.
In summary, the adipocytokines, as well as the gastric hormone ghrelin, are influenced by the duration and quality of sleep among adolescent girls. Obesity can be attributed to alterations of these hormones with a concomitant increased intake of carbohydrate-rich foods, as observed in those who slept less and intermittently. Further studies in a larger population using a prospective approach in a more controlled, experimental environment are needed to confirm these findings. |Reference Number|Reference|
