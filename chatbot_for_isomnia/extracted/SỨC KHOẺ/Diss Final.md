Adolescence is characterized by substantial biological, emotional, and, importantly, social change. This has led to interest into the links between adolescent social media use and sleep, which is crucial during this developmental phase. In much research, however, the measures used are inadequate at properly quantifying adolescents’ unique relationship to social media. The Index of Nighttime Offline Distress (iNOD), conversely, is a new self-reporting questionnaire that captures why adolescents feel difficulty trying to engage from social media at night. Scottish adolescents (N>3000) took an online survey that included the iNOD, as well as other measures of social media use that we argue fail to capture its unique affordances. To assess if the iNOD is an effective and relevant measure of social media use, various regression models of the different measures were built and compared. After analysis of goodness-of-fit and predictor dominance, we concluded that inclusion of the iNOD does explain more variance in sleep quality when compared to the other measures on their own. A brief introductory analysis into the effect of age was also conducted, finding that adolescents of various ages use social media for different purposes. We hope that our findings help show that the context of adolescent social media use is important and that there is evident diversity across the population. To best understand adolescent social media use and its impact on sleep, future research and policy should approach this relationship from a holistic, multifaceted direction, rather than viewing social media as solely a quantifiable techno-centric activity

## Summary
Technology allows us to be reachable 24/7. For adolescents, this, coupled with their strong desire to create and maintain social circles, can cause them to prioritize social media use over healthy sleep habits. While there is much current research investigating the connection between sleep and social media, results are often conflicting or inconclusive, and gaps in understanding make it difficult to effectively comprehend adolescents’ unique relationship to social media. In this study we assess the contribution of a new measurement of social media use, the Index of Nighttime Offline Distress (iNOD), a self-reporting questionnaire that specifically accounts for emotional concerns teenagers may feel at night when they need to disconnect and sleep. By comparing it to popular measures that have been used in previous research and may fall short, it was found that the iNOD is arguably a more effective and descriptive measure of social media when looking at how it affects sleep quality. Moving forward, we hope the iNOD can act as a model of the type of holistic approach that is needed to understand the relationship between social media and sleep for adolescents. Teenagers experience social media uniquely, and this must be accounted for when formatting sleep education, policy, and attitudes towards social media.

## Introduction
With 66% of the UK population actively using social media, it is clear how engrained social networking is to our lives. Social media is especially prevalent in teenagers' lives, with 95% of adolescents having access to a smartphone or device in 2019. Three quarters of adolescents have at least one social media profile, with almost half reporting that they are online "almost constantly". Adolescence is a period of significant biological, emotional, and social change, leading teenagers to strongly desire a feeling of social connection and acceptance. This can cause adolescents to utilize social media for different purposes than adults. For example, adolescents report using social media as an extension of face-to-face interactions, and do not distinguish a difference between online and offline communication. Furthermore, the desire to follow social norms, along with social media's facilitation of 24/7 communication can cause adolescents to prioritize social interaction over the need for sleep. As a result, unhealthy sleep habits impair emotional health, academic success, and physical safety of adolescents.

Due to the transitional nature of adolescence, there has been extensive research and policy centered around social media's influence on sleep, mental health, and wellbeing. However, the associations between these topics have often been found to be conflicting or unrelated. These inconsistencies can perhaps be explained through the variety in methodologies and analyses employed when researching social media, which often miss out on the larger picture. For example, many studies do not distinguish social media use from technology use overall with hours per day of "screen time", minimising social media's unique social affordances and neglecting the important underlying motivations that may displace sleep. Additionally, use is often framed as "addiction" or "dependence", despite no clinical backing to this assertion. This can create bias towards studies that explore only the negative aspects of social media, when adolescents report substantial benefits as well. Importantly, this type of adolescent input is missing from most studies, which are approached from an adult-centric view, ignoring the fact that adolescents use social media fundamentally differently than adults do. To begin to fill the gaps in the current research, a new measure - the Index of Nighttime Offline Distress (iNOD) - was created. Designed using input from adolescents on their personal attitudes and concerns towards social media and sleep, the iNOD measures difficulty disconnecting at night. The current study will compare the iNOD to other commonly-used measures of social media and their impact on sleep, and we expect the iNOD to add to the explanation of variance in adolescent sleep quality when compared to other measures alone, as it taps into a more comprehensive layer of understanding of adolescents' unique relationship to social media. Through the comparison of various regression models, it was concluded that the iNOD is an important predictor of sleep quality and does indeed account for significantly more of the variance when it is included in the regression model.

## Materials & Methods
Data was originally collected by Dr. Holly Scott for her PhD thesis.

### Participants
Participants were Scottish adolescents aged 10-18 years (N=3481, 51.6% female, average age=14.6 years), who each took the online survey through their school. The partner schools in question were recruited through online advertising of the survey, as well as at policy events around Scotland.

### Survey administration
Recruited partner schools were given information about the questionnaire and instructions on how to facilitate taking of the survey on their own time. Information for parents was also made available. The questionnaire was then distributed electronically to the partner school. Schools tended to distribute the survey to either the entire student body, or in some cases a smaller subset. Most schools ran the questionnaire during school hours, although some encouraged taking it during free time outside of school. The survey consisted of the measures listed in the next section, and took on average 10-20 minutes. Once participants had completed the questionnaire, the data was sent electronically back to the researchers.

The original study for which the data was collected was approved by the University of Glasgow College of Science and Engineering Ethics Committee. Additionally, permission was granted by a lead administrator in each partner school, as well as any required city councils. Neither names nor identifying details of the participants were taken. Participants were informed of the study details through a participant information sheet, and were aware that they could choose not to take part. If they chose to participate they were asked to manually give consent by electronically ticking a box. Parents, particularly of minors, could opt their child out of participation prior to survey distribution.

## Questionnaire items
The questionnaire included the Index of Nighttime Offline Distress (iNOD), as well as questions that reflected other measurement variables: emotional connection to social media, fear of missing out, personality traits, quantitative measures of social media use at night, typical sleep habits, and perceived sleep quality. The iNOD includes 10 questions that reflect why adolescents feel difficulty disconnecting from social media at night, based on adolescents' candid responses in focus groups. It consists of two subscales that reflect reasons adolescents gave for staying on social media at night despite the known costs: Staying Connected and Following Etiquette. These are reflected in the questions, such as "I worry that I will be left out from my friends the next day if I don't see something on social media that night" for Staying Connected, and "I feel like I have to continue a conversation even if I'm tired and want to fall asleep" for Following Etiquette. Participants were asked to rate each statement from 1 ("not at all true of me") to 4 ("extremely true of me") when asked to think about how they use social media at night. Emotional connection to social media was measured using the Social Integration and Emotional Connection subscale of the Social Media Use Integration Scale (SMUIS). The original scale used wording specific to Facebook, so in order to increase the scope of the scale mentions of Facebook were replaced with "social media", such as "Using social media is part of my everyday routine". Responses were measured on a 1-6 Likert scale with higher summed totals indicating greater levels of emotional connection to social media. The scale had good reliability in the population (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84).

The Fear of Missing Out scale (FOMO) measures how negatively an individual feels about the thought of others having rewarding experiences without them, and includes 10 related statements, such as "I get worried when I find out my friends are having fun without me". Participants are asked to rate each statement 1-5 from "not at all true of myself" to "extremely true of me" and a higher average score over the ten items indicates a more pervasive fear of missing out. The FOMO scale had good reliability in the sample (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89).

To measure sleep quality, the Sleep Condition Indicator was included (SCI). Its eight items measure difficulty falling and staying asleep, perceived sleep quality, ease or difficulty of daytime functioning, and the duration and frequency of sleep difficulties. Participants scored each item out of four, with a lower final summed score indicating poorer sleep quality. The SCI was originally intended to detect insomnia, indicated by a score of 16 or lower. The measure had good reliability in the population (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.83).

Participants also gave estimates, in hours and minutes, of how long they typically use social media daily, in bed at night, and after they feel they should have gone to sleep. Along with this, they also indicated what time they usually get in bed, what time they actually close their eyes to sleep, and gave an estimate of their total time spent asleep, both on weekdays and weekends.

The original questionnaire also included the mini International Personality Item Pool (mini-IPIP), a condensed 20-question version of the 50-item International Personality Item Pool (Goldberg, 1999). The mini-IPIP is an effective way to measure the Big Five personality traits: Agreeableness, Openness, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism. However, responses to the mini-IPIP were not used as we deemed personality too subjective and unrelated to the current study.

Data analysis
Analysis was carried out in R version 3.6.1. The data was extracted from Experimentum and loaded into R, where it was separated into various datasets for demographic analysis and regression model analysis. To explore the general characteristics of the sample, the average response to each of the predictor measures (iNOD, SMUIS, FOMO, SCI, and the three measures of social media use at night) was investigated. Additionally, average times for bedtime, shuteye time, wake time, and sleep duration in the population were calculated. To build the regression models, certain measures were selected for inclusion based on the themes that they represented. The SCI acted as a measure of overall sleep quality, the SMUIS represented how emotionally connected participants felt to social media, FOMO measured distress as a motivator to use social media, and daily social media use, social media use in bed, and social media use past of time the participant felt they should be asleep acted as a traditional "hours per day" measures. The iNOD represented the new, in-depth approach to social media use in question. Two multiple linear regression models were then built: a "full" model that included each of these measures, and a model with each measure except for the iNOD. To check the validity of the linear models, assumptions of normality for each of the measures were assessed. Multicollinearity was checked through Variance Inflation Factors (VIF), and all measures fell in an acceptable range (maximum VIF = 2.61). Acceptable linearity was also visually apparent for each predictor against the outcome measure SCI. Normality of residuals was checked visually through a QQ plot and numerically through a Shapiro-Wilk test. Visual assessment of the QQ plots did not indicate any serious deviations from normality, although the Shapiro-Wilk test did conclude that every predictor was non-normal. However, the Shapiro-Wilk test has been found to be overly sensitive in large datasets such as this one, and will often return a false positive, so in cases of datasets of N>300, the outcome of the QQ plot should be prioritized. Furthermore, tests of residual skew were carried out, and all measures fell in the acceptable range of +/-1.96. To check for homogeneity of the errors, or homoscedasticity, Non-Constant Variance Tests and Breusch-Pagan tests were applied. Both tests indicated violations of homoscedasticity for each measure. To remedy this, Eicker-Huber-White standard errors were applied to the original linear model, using "HC0" standard errors because of the large sample size. These modifications, combined with the Central Limit Theorem that large datasets will tend towards normality allowed us to be confident in the accuracy of the models' outputs. Both regression models were run again in full, and to compare goodness of fit, they were submitted to an ANOVA function. Subsequently a Dominance Analysis (DA) was run on the full regression model. DA estimates the R2 for all possible combinations of predictors in a model as they are related to an outcome variable, in this case SCI, to evaluate the importance of each individual predictor to the model. According to Azen & Budescu, “one predictor is ‘more important than another’ if it contributes more to the predictor of the criterion than does its competitor at a given level of analysis”. In this case the criterion is SCI, so DA assesses which predictors are the most “important” to determining sleep quality, and gives the ranked order in which they are dominant.

Results
Demographic associations Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations for all of the regression measures. The average score for the iNOD (mean=18.99, SD=8.88) was relatively low compared to the maximum score of 50, but upon inspection of the histogram it became clear that there is a floor effect, with a high amount of the responses concentrated at the lower response limit. The floor effect was present for both the Following Etiquette and Staying Connected subscales as well. The average score for the Sleep Condition Index was a 22.47, above the potential insomnia score cut off of 16, although 21.2% of participants did score a 16 or below. In fact, the SCI histogram shows a left skew, with a large proportion of answers clustering near the maximum limit, indicating better sleep quality for many. On average, participants reported using social media for a little more than 4 hours per day, about an hour and a half once they get into bed, and a little more than half an hour after they feel they should be asleep. For both social media usage in bed and after participants should be sleeping, there was another noticeable floor effect, with many participants reporting that they spend no time at all doing either (14.08% and 27.26% respectively).

Regression analysis
When regression analysis was run with and without the iNOD, it was found that more of the variance was explained when the iNOD was included in the model. With the inclusion of the iNOD, the 6 predictors explained 20.5% of the variance (R2=.2047, F(6,2316)=82.5, p<.001). Without the iNOD, the remaining 5 predictors explained 19.3% of the variance (R2=.1934, F(5,2317)=92.07, p<.001). Submitting both models to an ANOVA returned that the full model was significantly better at fitting the data than the model without the iNOD.

Table 4 presents the regression output for the full model. Of the predictors, the iNOD predicted sleep quality (β=-0.123, p<.0001), as did FOMO (β=-1.615, p<.0001), and social media use after the participant felt they should be asleep (β=-0.038, p<0.0001). SMUIS, social media daily use, and social media in bed did not predict sleep quality. The same pattern followed for the model without the iNOD. FOMO was still a significant predictor (β=-2.174, p<.0001), as was social media after the individual should sleep (β=-0.041, p<.0001). SMUIS, social media daily, and social media in bed once again did not predict sleep quality. Table 4 – Regression coefficients and output for full model

Finally, Dominance Analysis (DA) was carried out to assess the relative importance of each predictor in the full model. DA returned the contributions of each predictor on sleep quality, from most influential to least influential, as: FOMO (0.056), social media after the participant should sleep (0.053), iNOD (0.052), SMUIS (0.021), social media in bed (0.016), and social media daily (0.009).

Age Differences While the inclusion of the iNOD does explain more of the variance in sleep quality, it was only a slight improvement (1.6% increase in R2). This caused us to question what other factors could have an effect on sleep. As various periods of adolescence are associated with changes in circadian rhythms and the age range of the population was large, we began to consider age as a potential factor and a brief exploratory analysis into any potential effect was carried out. The population was split into an "older" group (above and including mean age) and a "younger" group (below mean age). To assess any objective differences between the groups, bedtime (the time a participant gets into bed), shuteye time (the time a participant actually closes their eyes to go to sleep), wake time, and sleep duration were compared with two sample t tests (Table 6). On both weekdays and weekends, older adolescents tended to get into bed later and close their eyes to sleep later than younger adolescents. There was no difference between the groups' wake times on weekdays, most likely due to similar times waking up for school. On weekends, however, older adolescents woke up later than their younger counterparts. Because they went to sleep earlier, younger adolescents had longer sleep durations on weekdays, which remained the case for weekends as well.

Additionally, both the younger and older populations were run through the full regression model. Table 7 presents the regression coefficients for both the younger and older samples. For younger adolescents, the model explained 25.3% of the variance in sleep quality (R2=.2529, F(6, 1175)=48.46), and the older adolescent model accounted for 14.2% (R2=.1421, F(6,1027)=29.29). The predictors of sleep quality that were significant in the full population model (FOMO, iNOD, social media use after intended bedtime) were consistent across both age groups as well.

Finally, to explore if age had an effect on the relative importance of the predictors, DA was run for both of the age groups’ regressions. When it came to the relative importance of each predictor in the model, the two age groups differed. The importance of predictors in the younger adolescent model, from highest to lowest dominance, were:

| Predictor                                      | Importance |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| social media use after when they would like to be asleep | 0.069      |
| the iNOD                                       | 0.067      |
| FOMO                                           | 0.054      |
| social media use in bed                        | 0.026      |
| SMUIS                                          | 0.025      |
| social media use daily                          | 0.015      |

For older adolescents FOMO was the most dominant in the model:

| Predictor                                      | Importance |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| FOMO                                           | 0.048      |
| the iNOD                                       | 0.035      |
| social media after they want to sleep          | 0.031      |
| SMUIS                                          | 0.023      |
| social media use in bed                        | 0.007      |
| social media daily use                          | 0.0003     |

This means that for younger participants, using social media after they feel they should be asleep is the most important predictor of sleep quality, whereas FOMO is the most important predictor for older adolescents.

Discussion
Based on the regression analyses and the Dominance Analysis, the iNOD does contribute to the explanation of adolescent sleep quality variance. As the regression model that included the iNOD fits the data significantly better, we can conclude that the iNOD and the constructs it represents are a useful measure in understanding social media use and its impact on sleep. As adolescents reported higher scores on the FOMO scale and the iNOD, as well as longer durations of using social media after they felt they should be asleep, scores on the SCI decreased (with lower scores on the SCI indicating worse sleep quality). Therefore, heightened distress about specific concerns (Following Etiquette and Staying Connected), greater preoccupation with the activities and experiences of others (FOMO), and extended use of social media after bedtime are associated with a decrease in sleep quality. This is in line with research that suggests simply quantifying use in hours and minutes or classifying social media as "addictive" are not effective approaches on their own. Two hours per day measures – social media use daily and social media use in bed – and the SMUIS, which represented emotional connection, were not significant predictors. As stated, there is currently no clinical backing for addiction to social media in particular, and higher levels of emotional connection to social media itself does not seem to affect sleep quality as the narrative of some previous studies suggests. Furthermore, the floor effect on the iNOD, its subscales, and both social media use in bed and after the desire to sleep indicate that many adolescents do not have trouble disengaging. The fact that many adolescents reported not using their phone at all after they had gotten into bed further challenges the idea that social media is highly addicting. If addiction or dependence were the case, we might expect to see absence of, or at least a minimization of the floor effect with many more adolescents reporting that they do not disconnect from their phone after they’ve gotten into bed.

Interestingly, all three significant predictors seem to be related in terms of the themes they represent. While social media use after the time the participant intended to be asleep is an "hours per day" measure, it is distinct in that it represents social media use that is specifically cutting into time that the participant feels they should be asleep. This choice to remain on social media despite the known cost is reflected in both subscales of the iNOD. For example, adolescents report not wanting to feel rude by ending a nighttime conversation (Following Etiquette), and feel that it is necessary to be reachable and responsive 24/7 (Staying Connected) - feelings that would likely keep them up past when they feel they should be asleep and be a detriment on sleep quality. Conversely, FOMO is reflected specifically in the Staying Connected subscale, which includes statements such as "I would feel left out from my friends if I could not use social media at night". FOMO anxiety could drive adolescents to remain on social media in order to not miss out, further cutting into sleep time and decreasing overall sleep quality. Furthermore, FOMO was the measure with the greatest predictor dominance in the model, suggesting that preoccupation with missing out may be especially influential on sleep quality, and could be worth further investigation. Overall, it is clear that feelings of wanting to be constantly available and following social norms are particularly salient to adolescents, and greater preoccupation with these traits is associated with worse sleep quality
Furthermore, our brief exploratory analysis showed that some potential age differences exist when it comes to adolescent social media use and sleep, which highlights that there is diversity within these subjects For example, the dominance analysis showed that social media after the participant wants to sleep was the most important predictor of sleep quality for younger adolescents, but FOMO was the most important for older adolescents This is in line with social changes during adolescence – in the early stages of this time the focus is on creating a social circle, whereas later on in the motivation becomes maintaining that group The dominance analyses reflect this transition, as younger adolescents may be feeling like they need to stay on social media even after they might want to disconnect to make friends, while older adolescents could be more preoccupied with missing out from their already established friend groups This reinforces the idea that across the span of adolescence there are fundamental differences, and these can range from changes objective habits such as as bedtime or sleep duration to subjective experiences like the motivations to use social media
Moving forward, we hope that the conclusions of this study can be used to investigate further research Social media is an ever-changing landscape that is likely to become even further prevalent in our lives, and this calls for a better understanding of how it can affect those that use it the most For one, the causes and consequences of FOMO anxiety in particular should be investigated further, as it seems to be a significant detriment on sleep quality Additionally, the brief exploration into age shows further promising evidence to support the merits of moving away from the generalized and narrow approaches that can be commonly utilized in current social media research For example, studies sometimes focus on a small age range of adolescence or work off of blanketed assumptions about social media use, but the differences between even the two age groups explored here show that there is evident diversity across motivations and patterns of use in adolescence. These important differences can be lost if the focus is too narrow, or too one-dimensional. There are clearly divergences and diversity within how and why social media is used across different stages of adolescence, and this phenomenon is important to creating a deeper understanding of the social media/sleep relationship
Additionally, we hope that pushing for holistic approaches and recognition of diversity will inform policy and attitudes towards social media and sleep. Often attitudes towards social media use can revolve around “how often” or “how much is too much”, which have been shown to miss out on the crucial bigger picture of why adolescents want to spend time on their devices. To mitigate “overuse” or “addiction” the solution is often to remove the device from the adolescent or set inflexible time limits for use. And while setting time and content boundaries on social media is important, simply removing the source can exacerbate anxiety over missing out or being rude and create further problems. Sleep interventions, school policies, and parenting strategies should be shaped to target underlying distress about using social media, including staying connected and following social etiquette, rather than solely limiting screen time. Furthermore, the differences between age groups show that there needs to be a focus on diversification of policy and discussions about social media and sleep. It is clear that policy and attitudes cannot be “one size fits all” when underlying biological and emotional changes play a role in how different ages use social media and how this affects their sleep patterns. Importantly, attitudes surrounding this topic should be less about quantity of use and more about context of use, and particularly how that may change over time. And crucially, forming these policies and strategies, as well as future research, should incorporate adolescent input, as this is one of the unique strengths of the iNOD. Truly understanding adolescents’ relationship to social media will come from discussions with the adolescents themselves, and not from third-party assumptions.
There were some limitations to the study, notably the self-reporting aspect, as this can introduce bias. This is particularly evident when subjective topics such as sleep quality are being measured, as individual differences in the personal experience of "good" or "bad" sleep will always be present. Furthermore, while the iNOD gives valuable insight into the individual experiences of adolescents, this sort of subjective measure should be utilized in tandem with verifiable ones, like social media activity and sleep habits. The subjective nature of social media use is clearly important, but that is not to say quantifiable measures should be ignored completely. Overall, a holistic approach that includes objective and subjective measures will best unite biology, behavior, and psychology.

Adolescence is a time of extraordinary social, emotional, cognitive, and biological change as teenagers transition into adulthood, and it can be challenging to navigate for adolescents, parents, and administrators. Social media will remain a crucial part of adolescents’ lives and effective policies and attitudes should recognize this. Therefore, the most holistic and relevant information and support should be available, including facilitating healthy social media use. As a measurement tool, the iNOD serves as an effective example of the merit in moving past “screen time” and examining the underlying concerns some adolescents feel when trying to disconnect from social media to sleep. To continue to support adolescents and encourage healthy sleep practices there needs to be an emphasis on this sort of comprehensive and meaningful approach to social media, rather than viewing it as simply a function of technology.
