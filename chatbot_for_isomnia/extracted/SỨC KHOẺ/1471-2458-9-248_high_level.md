# Title: Effects of an irregular bedtime schedule on sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue among university students in Taiwan

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of irregular bedtime schedules on sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue among university students in Taiwan. It involved 160 students who completed various sleep assessment measures. The findings indicate that increased irregularity in bedtime is significantly associated with reduced average sleep time and poorer sleep quality, particularly in students with higher frequencies of irregular bedtimes. The study highlights the prevalence of irregular sleep patterns and insufficient sleep among this demographic, suggesting a need for further research into the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions.
