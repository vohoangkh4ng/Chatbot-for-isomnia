# Title: Relationships between Severity of Internet Gaming Disorder, Severity of Problematic Social Media Use, Sleep Quality and Psychological Distress

## Summary: This study investigates the relationships between the severity of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and problematic social media use (operationalized as social media addiction) with sleep quality and psychological distress among young adults. Conducted among Hong Kong university students, the research found that higher levels of IGD and social media addiction are associated with increased psychological distress and poorer sleep quality. The study utilized various scales to measure these factors and highlighted significant associations, suggesting that both IGD and social media addiction negatively impact mental health and sleep.
