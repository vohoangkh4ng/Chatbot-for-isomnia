# Title: Focus Groups to Inform User-Centered Development of an eHealth Sleep Intervention for Adolescents: Perspectives of Youth with Insomnia Symptoms, with and without Pain

## Summary: This article explores the development of an eHealth sleep intervention tailored for adolescents experiencing insomnia symptoms, with a focus on gathering insights from both the youth and associated stakeholders. Through six online focus groups involving 24 adolescents and seven groups with 22 stakeholders, the study identifies perceptions of healthy sleep practices, barriers to achieving good sleep, and preferences for eHealth intervention features. Key findings highlight the importance of addressing adolescent-specific barriers, such as technology use and academic pressures, while also emphasizing the need for engaging and accessible content in the intervention. The research serves as a foundational step in creating a user-centered eHealth solution aimed at improving sleep health among adolescents.
