# Title: An Exploratory Study on Sleep Procrastination: Bedtime vs. While-in-Bed Procrastination

## Summary: This study investigates the concept of Sleep Procrastination, distinguishing between behaviors before bed (Bedtime Procrastination) and those after getting into bed (While-in-Bed Procrastination). Conducted with 400 high school students, the research introduces a new scale for While-in-Bed Procrastination and finds a low correlation with Bedtime Procrastination. The results suggest that these two forms of procrastination are distinct yet related, with implications for understanding sleep behaviors in adolescents. The study highlights the need to consider While-in-Bed Procrastination in future research on sleep insufficiency, which affects a significant portion of adolescents.
