# Title: Technology use as a sleep-onset aid: are adolescents using apps to distract themselves from negative thoughts?

## Summary: This study investigates the use of technology by adolescents as a means to distract themselves from negative thoughts before sleep. It explores whether those with perceived sleep problems utilize technology more for distraction compared to those without such complaints. The research, involving 684 adolescents, reveals that a significant portion uses devices like smartphones and apps such as YouTube and Snapchat for distraction, particularly among those reporting sleep difficulties. The findings suggest that technology may serve as a tool for managing negative thoughts at bedtime, challenging the notion that it solely contributes to sleep issues.
