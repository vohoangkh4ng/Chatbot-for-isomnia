# Title: Impact of Multi-Night Experimentally Induced Short Sleep on Adolescent Performance in a Simulated Classroom

## Summary: This study investigates the effects of experimentally induced short sleep on adolescents' learning and behavior in a classroom-like setting. Eighty-seven healthy adolescents participated in a three-week sleep manipulation protocol, alternating between short sleep (6.5 hours) and healthy sleep (10 hours). Results indicated that adolescents performed significantly worse on quizzes and exhibited more inattentive and sleepy behaviors during the short sleep condition. The findings suggest a causal relationship between reduced sleep duration and academic performance, highlighting the negative impact of chronic sleep deprivation on adolescents' functioning and health.
