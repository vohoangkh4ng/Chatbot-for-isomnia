# Title: Sleep Position and Sleep Stages: Evidence of Their Independence

## Summary: This article presents findings from a study investigating the relationship between sleep positions and sleep stages across different age groups. The research involved five age categories, with subjects monitored over four nights in a laboratory setting. Results indicated no significant correlation between sleep stages and positions, suggesting that while there are developmental trends in sleep position preferences, these positions operate independently of sleep stages and do not exhibit consistent rhythmic patterns.
