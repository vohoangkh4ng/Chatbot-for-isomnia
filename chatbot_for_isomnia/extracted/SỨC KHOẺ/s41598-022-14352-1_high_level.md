# Title: Association of weekend catchâ€‘up sleep ratio and sleep quality with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among Korean adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between weekend catch-up sleep (CUS) ratio and sleep quality with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in South Korean adolescents. Utilizing data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (2015-2019) involving 270,619 adolescents, the research finds that a weekend CUS ratio of less than 1.00 and poor sleep quality are significantly linked to mental health issues. The study highlights that insufficient sleep duration, particularly during weekdays, correlates strongly with depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts. It emphasizes the importance of considering weekend CUS ratios alongside sleep quality and duration when examining adolescent mental health.
