# Title: Sleep problems, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and domains of health-related quality of life: bidirectional associations from early childhood to early adolescence

## Summary: This article investigates the longitudinal and bidirectional relationships between behavioral sleep problems, mental health symptoms (both internalizing and externalizing), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Australian children from early childhood to adolescence. Utilizing data from a national cohort study, the findings indicate that sleep problems are linked to poorer HRQoL outcomes, with HRQoL more strongly predicting later internalizing symptoms and externalizing symptoms predicting later HRQoL. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing sleep issues and HRQoL to potentially mitigate the development of mental health conditions in children.
