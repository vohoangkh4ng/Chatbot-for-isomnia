# Title: Adolescent sleep characteristics and body-mass index in the family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and eating (fLASHe) Study

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between sleep duration and timing with overweight and obesity in adolescents, focusing on weekday-weekend differences and sex-specific patterns. Analyzing data from 1,254 U.S. adolescents aged 12-17, the findings reveal an inverse association between sleep duration and obesity, with short sleep on weekdays linked to higher obesity odds, particularly in females. The study highlights the importance of sleep in adolescent obesity and suggests that sex differences in sleep patterns warrant further research.
