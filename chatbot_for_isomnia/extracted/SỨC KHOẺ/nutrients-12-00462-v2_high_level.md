# Title: Association between the Degree of Processing of Consumed Foods and Sleep Quality in Adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between food processing levels and sleep quality among adolescents in São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil. A cross-sectional analysis involving 2499 adolescents aged 18 to 19 years was conducted, utilizing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess sleep quality. The findings indicate that a higher intake of fresh or minimally processed foods (FMPF) is associated with better sleep quality, while increased consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) correlates with poorer sleep quality. Specifically, adolescents consuming higher proportions of FMPF experienced lower prevalence rates of poor sleep quality, whereas those with higher UPF intake showed an increased prevalence of sleep issues.
