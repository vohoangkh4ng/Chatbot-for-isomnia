# Title: The Diagnostic Yield of a Second EEG After Partial Sleep Deprivation: A Prospective Study in Children with Newly Diagnosed Seizures

## Summary: This article investigates the effectiveness of a repeated EEG (REPEEG) following partial sleep deprivation (SD) in enhancing the diagnostic yield for children and adolescents experiencing one or more seizures. The study found that approximately one-third of REPEEGs provided new diagnostic information, particularly in cases where the initial standard EEG (STDEEG) did not show epileptiform abnormalities. The findings suggest that partial sleep deprivation is a valuable method for increasing the likelihood of detecting epileptiform abnormalities in EEG recordings, thereby aiding in the diagnosis of epilepsy in pediatric patients.
