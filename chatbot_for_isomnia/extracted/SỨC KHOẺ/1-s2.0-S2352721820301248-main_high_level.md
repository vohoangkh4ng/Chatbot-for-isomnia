# Title: Associations of time spent on homework or studying with nocturnal sleep behavior and depression symptoms in adolescents from Singapore

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between the time adolescents spend on homework or studying and their sleep patterns and symptoms of depression. Conducted through a cross-sectional survey involving 1,225 adolescents in Singapore, the study finds that increased homework/studying correlates with reduced sleep duration and higher depression scores. The findings suggest that long hours dedicated to academic work, particularly on weekends, may negatively impact adolescents' mental well-being and sleep quality, highlighting the need for a balanced workload to support their health.
