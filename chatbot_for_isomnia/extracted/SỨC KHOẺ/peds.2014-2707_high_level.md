## Summary: This article examines the decline in average nightly sleep duration among US adolescents from 1991 to 2012, utilizing data from a nationally representative survey. The findings indicate a significant decrease in sleep, particularly between the mid-1990s and early 2000s, with variations observed across demographic subgroups. The study highlights concerning trends, including a widening gender gap in sleep adequacy and discrepancies in sleep perceptions among racial/ethnic minorities and adolescents from low socioeconomic backgrounds.
