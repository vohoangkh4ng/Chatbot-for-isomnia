# Title: The moderating roles of bedtime activities and anxiety/depression in the relationship between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and sleep problems in children

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and sleep problems in children, focusing on the moderating effects of bedtime activities and anxiety/depression. The research involved 934 primary students and their parents, utilizing various assessment tools. Findings indicate that children with ADHD symptoms experience more sleep issues, particularly with increased screen time and bedtime eating. Additionally, anxiety and depression exacerbate sleep problems, suggesting that managing bedtime routines and emotional health may improve sleep quality for children with ADHD.
