# Title: The Longitudinal Interplay between Sleep, Anthropometric Indices, Eating Behaviors, and Nutritional Aspects: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

## Summary: This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the longitudinal relationships between sleep dimensions (duration, timing, quality, and insomnia symptoms) and various health indicators in adolescents, including anthropometric indices, eating behaviors, and nutritional aspects. The findings indicate that longer sleep duration and better sleep quality are linked to lower body mass index (BMI) and fat percentage, while insufficient sleep is associated with a higher risk of obesity. The review highlights the need for further research into the bidirectional associations between sleep and eating behaviors, emphasizing the critical role of sleep in adolescent health.
