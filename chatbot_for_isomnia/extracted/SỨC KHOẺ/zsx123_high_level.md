# Title: Feasibility and Emotional Impact of Experimentally Extending Sleep in Short-Sleeping Adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the feasibility and emotional effects of a sleep manipulation protocol aimed at extending sleep duration in habitually short-sleeping adolescents during school nights. Conducted over five weeks with high school students aged 14-18, the research compared a baseline sleep condition with a sleep extension condition that increased time in bed by 1.5 hours. Results indicated that participants experienced significant increases in sleep duration and reductions in negative mood symptoms. The findings suggest that extending sleep can have beneficial emotional impacts on adolescents, supporting public health initiatives to promote better sleep habits during the school year.
