# Title: Sleep Related Cognitions in Individuals with Symptoms of Insomnia and Depression

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between insomnia and depression, focusing on individuals who exhibit comorbid symptoms of both conditions. It highlights that depression is the most common comorbidity associated with insomnia and suggests that these disorders may share common mechanisms or influence each other's clinical course. The study examines cognitive-related variables such as past week worry, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and insomnia symptom-focused rumination, finding that individuals with both insomnia and depression report higher levels of these cognitive issues. The findings underscore the need for tailored treatment approaches for those experiencing both conditions, particularly regarding their sleep-related cognitions.
