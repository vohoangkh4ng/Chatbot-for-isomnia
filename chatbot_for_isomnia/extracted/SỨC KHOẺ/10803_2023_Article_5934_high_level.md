# Title: Sleep Problems, Circadian Rhythms, and Their Relation to Behavioral Difficulties in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder

## Summary: This exploratory cross-sectional study investigates sleep problems and circadian rhythms in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) compared to typically developing controls. It highlights that poor sleep is linked to higher behavioral difficulties, including anxiety and self-injury. The study utilizes objective measures such as circadian monitoring and saliva samples to assess melatonin levels, revealing that sleep fragmentation negatively impacts family life and is associated with various behavioral issues. Additionally, phase advanced dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) appears to have a protective effect against certain behavioral problems.
