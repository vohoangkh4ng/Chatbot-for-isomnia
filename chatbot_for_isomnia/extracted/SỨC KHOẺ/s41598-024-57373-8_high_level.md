# Title: Sensitivity to thyroid hormones is associated with sleep duration in the euthyroid population with depression degree lower than moderate

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between thyroid hormone sensitivity and sleep duration in individuals with depression who are euthyroid. Using data from the NHANES 2009â€“2012 cycles, the study finds that only those with a depression score lower than moderate show a significant association between thyroid-stimulating hormone index (TSHI) and sleep duration. The analysis reveals a non-linear relationship, indicating that as sensitivity to thyroid hormones increases, sleep duration also increases. The findings suggest that poor sensitivity to thyroid hormones is linked to longer sleep duration in this population, highlighting the importance of sleep regulation in managing depression.
