# Title: Neurobehavioral Impact of Successive Cycles of Sleep Restriction With and Without Naps in Adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the neurobehavioral effects of sleep restriction in adolescents, focusing on two cycles of restricted sleep followed by recovery sleep, and the role of afternoon naps. Fifty-seven healthy adolescents participated in the study, which simulated typical sleep patterns during school weeks. Results indicated that sleep restriction led to a decline in sustained attention and other cognitive functions, which did not fully recover even after recovery sleep. Napping provided some benefits but was insufficient to counteract the negative impacts of sleep restriction compared to consistent adequate sleep. The findings suggest that adolescents may struggle to adapt to repeated cycles of sleep deprivation and recovery.
