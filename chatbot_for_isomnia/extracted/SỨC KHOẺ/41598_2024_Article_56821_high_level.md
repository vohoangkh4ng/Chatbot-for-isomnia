# Title: Predictors of healthâ€‘related quality of life for children with neurodevelopmental conditions

## Summary: This article investigates the predictors of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and youth with neurodevelopmental conditions. Utilizing a cross-sectional sample from the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders Network, the study analyzes data from 615 participants, focusing on demographics, core features, co-occurring symptoms, and adaptive functioning. The findings reveal that HRQoL is negatively impacted by co-occurring symptoms and age, while higher socioeconomic status is associated with fewer co-occurring symptoms. The study emphasizes the need for longitudinal research to better understand the evolving experiences and needs of this population.
