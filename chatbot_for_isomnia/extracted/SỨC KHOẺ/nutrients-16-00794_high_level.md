## Summary: This study investigates the link between high caffeine consumption and anxiety levels among South Korean adolescents, utilizing data from 46,873 participants in the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS) 2022. The findings indicate that both male and female adolescents who consume high-caffeine drinks excessively exhibit higher levels of anxiety, with a statistically significant association observed across various subgroups, particularly among high school students and those with shorter sleep durations. The research highlights a dose-dependent relationship between caffeine intake and anxiety prevalence, suggesting that increased caffeine consumption correlates with heightened anxiety symptoms.
