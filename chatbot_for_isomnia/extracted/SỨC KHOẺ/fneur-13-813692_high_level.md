# Title: Melatonin Rhythm and Its Relation to Sleep and Circadian Parameters in Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder

## Summary: This research investigates the relationship between melatonin secretion patterns and sleep as well as circadian parameters in children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The study involved a cross-sectional analysis of 41 autistic individuals and 24 controls, focusing on dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and its correlation with sleep onset times and circadian rhythms. Findings indicate that prepubertal individuals with ASD exhibit later DLMO and a distinct melatonin secretion pattern compared to controls, suggesting that melatonin may play a significant role in the sleep disturbances commonly observed in this population. The study highlights the potential of using ambulatory circadian monitoring devices to better understand sleep issues in children with ASD.
