## ABSTRACT
Previous studies indicate that solar clock (daily changes in the Earth’s surface illumination) is a main zeitgeber for human circadian system. It has been shown that human biological clock is weakly adjusted to such changes in social clock as daylight saving time (DST). There are two changes of social clock in Russian Federation: on 25 March 2011, DST has been replaced by permanent DST (DSTp), which was subsequently revoked on 26 October 2014 (non-DSTp). These manipulations with social clock may lead to prolonged disturbances of human circadian system. Our hypothesis is that during period of DSTp, the dissociation between social and biological clocks was greatest as compared with DST and non-DSTp periods. Here, we examine the effects of DSTp on the sleep timing, social jetlag (SJL), academic performance, and winter and summer seasonality of mood and behavior of 10–24-year-old inhabitants of European North of Russia. A cross-sectional retrospective analysis of questionnaire data (n = 7968) was performed using chi squared-test and analysis of covariance. Our findings indicate that SJL (F2,7967 = 31.9; p < 0.0001; η2 = 0.009), and winter pattern of mood seasonality (22,7967 = 10.5; p < 0.01) were increased in adolescents during the period of DSTp as compared with DST and non-DSTp periods. The largest increase in SJL was occurred in ages between 10 and 17-year-olds. The finding suggests that increase in SJL can be attributed to a later rise time on free days (F2,7967 = 44.9; p < 0.0001; η2 = 0.012). Similar changes were observed in three subsamples obtained in Syktyvkar, Petrozavodsk, and Vorkuta. Effect sizes of studied relationships were small or very small. The greatest effect sizes (η2 ∼ 0.05) were observed in Arctic M. F. BORISENKOV ET AL.

city of Vorkuta indicating that in polar region, solar clock is still stronger zeitgeber for human circadian system, than the social clock. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that there is a greatest dissociation between social and biological clocks during the period of DSTp which potentially exerts a negative influence on adolescents’ sleep habits, mood, and behavior. Our data indicate that “non-DSTp” social clock system most suitable for prevention dissociation between social and biological clocks.

## Introduction
Social jetlag (SJL) is a misalignment between the social and the biological clock that is widespread among residents of industrialized countries. Social jetlag has been shown apparently associated with poor academic performance, depression, and obesity. Previously, it was shown that human circadian system is purely adjusted to daylight saving time (DST) and the increases in the sizes of time zones increase the risk of SJL. Therefore, such changes in social clock have the potential to adversely affect the cognitive function, well-being, and health of affected populations. In the Russian Federation, two changes were made to the social time system over a short period. On 25 March 2011, the country replaced DST with permanent DST (DSTp). This DSTp was subsequently revoked on 26 October 2014 (non-DSTp). However, for more than 3 years, the population of the Russian Federation observed DSTp. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of chronic 1-h forward and backward transition of social clock on sleep timing, academic performance, and mood seasonality of Russian residents.

## Materials and methods
### Subjects and instruments
This study was approved by the ethical committee of the Institute of Physiology of Komi Science Centre, the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. A cross-sectional retrospective analysis was conducted on continuous data accumulated over a 7-year period (from 2009 to 2016). The study participants were enrolled in schools and universities located in 14 settlements in the European North of Russia. The data were obtained from 7968 participants aged 10 to 24 years. For each participant, personal data (i.e., date, place of residence, age, sex, height, weight, and academic performance) were collected. For details, see Figure 1 and Table 2. Chronotype, the degree of SJL, and sleep characteristics were estimated using the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire. A mid-sleep phase shift between weekdays and weekend of ≥ 1 h and ≥ 2 h were used as the criteria for SJL ≥ 1 h and SJL ≥ 2 h group assignment, respectively. Winter and summer pattern of seasonality of mood and behavior were assessed using the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire.

Notes: We assessed the type (winter, summer) and severity (saD, sub-saD, or no-saD) of seasonal affective disorder in study participants using the responses on the items #11, 12 and 17 of sPaQ. item#11 – global seasonality score (gss). changed from 0 to 24 scores. item#12 – “at what time of year do you feel the worst?” changed from 1 (Jan.) to 12 (Dec.). item#17 – seasonal changes to be problematic. changed from: 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (marked), 4 (severe), 5 (disabling).

Statistical analysis
All the data were divided into three periods as described in Table 1. A chi squared-test was used for analysis of influence of periods on non-parametric variables. Two series of one way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed for normally distributed variables. Firstly, we performed the analysis using “period” as fixed factor, “anthropometric characteristics”, “school start time” (SST), “achievement”, and “global Seasonality Scores” (gSS) as dependent variables, and “month of survey”, “year of survey”, “settlement population”, “latitude”, “longitude”, “time of sunrise”, “day length”, and “age” as covariates. The variables “BMI” and “settlement population” are non-normally distributed, therefore, we used normalized “lnBMI” and “ln(settlement population)” in analysis. There is a certain imbalance in age, anthropometric characteristics and SST in the three groups studied (Table 4) Therefore, the above characteristics were included in the second set of ANCOVAs as covariates. Secondly, one way ANCOVAs were performed using “period” as fixed factor, “chronotype, SJL, and sleep # Table 4. anthropometric characteristics of persons studied.

Results
Social jetlag ≥ 1 and 2 h was observed in 86.4 and 59.3% of individuals surveyed, respectively. During the period of time corresponding to DSTp, the proportions of people with SJL ≥ 1 h and 2 h increased by 6.7% and 16.3%, respectively. An increase in gSS and winter pattern of mood seasonality were also observed during the period of time corresponding to DSTp. There were no significant changes in summer pattern of mood seasonality during three period studied. The largest increase in SJL occurred in 10 to 17-year-olds. This finding can be primarily attributed to a later rise time on free days. Two analyses of covariance were performed to evaluate the hypothesis that the changes in SJL can be primarily attributed to a later rise time on free days: 1: according to the procedure described above; 2: in addition, “get-up time on free days” was used as covariate. Significant influence of “period” on SJL was found only in first analysis but not in second one indicating that our hypothesis is true.

Similar data were observed in three subsamples obtained in Syktyvkar, Petrozavodsk, and Vorkuta with some features. In Petrozavodsk was observed significant impact of “period” on “academic performance” with maximal values during the non-DSTp period. There were no significant effect of “period” on SADw in Petrozavodsk and Vorkuta. “Period” had greatest effect size on SJL, gUT F, and gSS in Vorkuta’s subsample. There was a lower percentage of SADw in children and adolescents living in Vorkuta, as compared with their peers living in other. | Age, yrs | Percentage of sJl ≥ 1 h | Percentage of sJl ≥ 2 h |

settlements of Northern European Russia (7.13% vs. 5.14%; χ21,7967 = 8.96; p < 0.005). At the same time, mean values of gSS were the same in compared groups (9.09 vs. 9.02; t1,7967 = 0.46; p > 0.05). This means that children and adolescents from Vorkuta less likely to perceive seasonal changes in their mood and behavior as a serious problem. However, this question is outside the scope of the study.

Discussion
The main finding of the study is that during the period when DSTp was observed in Russian Federation, the number of people suffering from SJL (i.e. those with chronic sleep deprivation during workweek nights) was significantly increased. To compensate sleep deprivation, people began to sleep more on weekend nights, mainly due to delay time of awakening.

Previously, it was shown that human circadian system entrained by solar but not social clocks. The practice of yearly forward and backward transitions of social clock reduces the ability of the human biological clock to seasonal adjustment. Our data indicate that DSTp causes chronic dissociation between social and biological clock that persists for more than three years.

between social and biological clocks was observed in 10–17-year-olds. One possible explanation for this – higher sensitivity of the circadian system of adolescents to light signals. Surprisingly, social clock manipulations had the greatest effect on SJL, gUT F, and gSS in children and adolescents living in the Arctic city of Vorkuta. This means that in polar region the solar clock is still stronger zeitgeber for human circadian system, than the social clock. This issue requires more thorough study in special research. According to Roenneberg et al., SJL ≥ 1 h occurs in 70% of the population. The higher SJL index values that we observed can potentially be attributed to the fact that we focused primarily on young people, who are at greater risk of SJL than adults. In addition, our study involved only residents living at high latitudes. These residents more commonly exhibit late chronotype and, accordingly, SJL. Previous studies have shown that changes in the circadian system are associated with SJL; SJL ≥ 1 h is associated with a marked decrease in the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of wrist temperature, SJL ≥ 2 h is associated with a larger cortisol awakening response and an increased risk of depression.

Limitations
The study was carried out retrospectively, therefore it was impossible to organize data collection in accordance with the goal and objectives of the research. All significant effects were either small or very small in size (eta squared less than 0.05). We used a cross-sectional study design, which does not allow to find out the cause-effect relationships between the studied parameters. ## Conclusion
We have shown for the first time an increase in SJL, delay in rise time on free days and increased percentage of winter pattern of seasonality of mood and behavior in children and adolescents during the period of time that DSTp was observed in the Russian Federation. Chronic 1-h forward transition of social clock potentially exerts a negative influence on adolescents’ sleep habits, mood, and behavior.
