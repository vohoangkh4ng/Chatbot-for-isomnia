# Title: School Term vs. School Holiday: Associations with Children’s Physical Activity, Screen-Time, Diet and Sleep

## Summary: This cross-sectional study investigates the differences in children's health behaviors during school terms compared to school holidays, focusing on physical activity, screen time, diet, and sleep. The research involved 406 children aged 5–18 years and analyzed how weather conditions influenced these behaviors. Findings indicate that children engaged in more physical activity and watched more TV during school holidays. However, the relationship between school holidays and TV viewing diminished when accounting for weather factors. Additionally, high precipitation negatively impacted the likelihood of meeting physical activity guidelines, while no significant associations were found regarding sleep or screen time guidelines.
