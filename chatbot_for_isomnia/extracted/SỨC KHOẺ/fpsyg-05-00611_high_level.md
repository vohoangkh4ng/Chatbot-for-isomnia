# Title: Bedtime procrastination: introducing a new area of procrastination

## Summary: This article explores the concept of bedtime procrastination, defined as the failure to go to bed at the intended time without external constraints. It highlights the negative impact of this behavior on sleep quality and overall well-being. The study conducted an online survey with 177 participants to investigate the relationship between bedtime procrastination, self-regulation, and sleep outcomes. Findings indicate that lower self-regulation is associated with higher levels of bedtime procrastination, which in turn correlates with reports of insufficient sleep. The research emphasizes the need to consider procrastination beyond academic contexts, particularly its implications for health behaviors.
