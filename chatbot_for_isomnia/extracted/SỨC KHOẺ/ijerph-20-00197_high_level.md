# Title: Association between Chronotype and Sleep Quality among Chinese College Students: The Role of Bedtime Procrastination and Sleep Hygiene Awareness

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between chronotype and sleep quality in Chinese college students, focusing on the mediating effects of bedtime procrastination and the moderating role of sleep hygiene awareness. Analyzing data from 2822 students, the findings reveal that evening-type students experience the lowest sleep quality and highest bedtime procrastination, while morning-type students report the opposite. Bedtime procrastination partially mediates the link between chronotype and sleep quality, and higher sleep hygiene awareness can mitigate the negative impacts of chronotype on sleep quality, although it may exacerbate bedtime procrastination. The results underscore the need for interventions aimed at reducing bedtime procrastination and enhancing sleep hygiene awareness to improve sleep quality among college students, particularly those with evening chronotypes.
