# Title: Gender differences in adolescent sleep neurophysiology: a highâ€‘density sleep EEG study

## Summary: This study investigates gender differences in sleep neurophysiology during early adolescence using high-density sleep EEG. It analyzes sleep EEG power and coherence across frequency bands for both NREM and REM sleep in a sample of 61 adolescents. The findings reveal that girls exhibit significantly greater spindle activity and higher power in higher frequency bands compared to boys, suggesting stronger thalamocortical circuits and greater global connectivity in females. The study emphasizes the importance of considering gender in sleep neurophysiology research, given the pronounced differences observed.
