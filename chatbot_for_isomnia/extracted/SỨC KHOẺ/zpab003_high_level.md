# Title: The role of pubertal status and sleep satisfaction in emotion reactivity and regulation in children and adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between pubertal status, sleep satisfaction, and emotion functioning in children and adolescents aged 8â€“15. It identifies three classes of sleepers based on satisfaction levels and finds that dissatisfied sleepers experience greater difficulties with emotion regulation and higher emotion reactivity. The research highlights the significant role of pubertal development, particularly in girls, in moderating the effects of sleep satisfaction on emotion regulation. The findings suggest that the period of puberty is crucial for interventions aimed at improving sleep hygiene to support emotional well-being.
