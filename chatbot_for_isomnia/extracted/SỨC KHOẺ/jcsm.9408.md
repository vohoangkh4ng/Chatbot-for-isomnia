## Circadian factors in comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea

We thank Salles and Meira e Cruz for their response to our recent publication investigating the effects of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms on response to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia in patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). We agree with the authors that it is important to investigate the contribution of circadian factors to the prevalence and treatment of COMISA. In addition to the points raised by Salles and Meira e Cruz, we highlight additional research questions related to circadian misalignment in patients with COMISA because this is an emerging priority in our group. Progressing with this research is an important priority for identifying pathways and targeting treatment approaches in patients with COMISA.

Approximately 30%–50% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) report insomnia symptoms, whereas 30–40% of patients with insomnia have comorbid OSA. These prevalence estimates are higher than would be expected, based on the general population prevalence of insomnia alone and OSA alone, potentially indicating causal associations between the 2 disorders. It is feasible that circadian factors contribute to the high prevalence of COMISA. Unfortunately, however, there is a significant gap in research that has considered circadian rhythms in clinical sleep disorders broadly and limits our understanding.

We propose that the next step will be to identify the contribution of circadian misalignment to patients with COMISA in clinical settings. Dim-light melatonin onset is the ‘gold standard’ measure of circadian phase. Although dim-light melatonin onset has been investigated in patients with insomnia alone and OSA alone, we are not aware of any research investigating dim-light melatonin onset in COMISA. It is possible that circadian factors play an important role in the development of COMISA through shared risk factors and/or causal pathways between the 2 disorders. For example, bidirectional relationships between the timing of sleep, energy intake, and energy expenditure may contribute to sleeping difficulties, development of insomnia symptoms in response to perceived sleep loss/effects, gradual weight gain, and increased risk of OSA.
