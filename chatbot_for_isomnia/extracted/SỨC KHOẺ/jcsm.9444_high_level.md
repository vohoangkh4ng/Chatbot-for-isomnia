# Title: Associations of frequent pain symptoms with excessive daytime sleepiness in adolescents: a longitudinal study

## Summary: This longitudinal study investigates the relationship between frequent pain symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in a sample of 7,072 adolescents in Shandong, China. The findings indicate that frequent pain is significantly associated with an increased risk of both incident and persistent EDS over a one-year follow-up period, even after controlling for various factors such as sleep duration and anxiety/depression. The study highlights the importance of assessing and treating pain symptoms to improve sleep health and reduce EDS risk in adolescents. Further research is suggested to explore the underlying mechanisms linking pain and daytime sleepiness.
