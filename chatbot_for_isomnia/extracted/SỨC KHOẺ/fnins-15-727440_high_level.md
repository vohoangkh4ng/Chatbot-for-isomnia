# Title: Bedtime Procrastination Partially Mediates the Impact of Personality Characteristics on Daytime Fatigue Resulting From Sleep Deficiency

## Summary: This research investigates the relationship between bedtime procrastination, personality traits, and daytime fatigue among university students. It highlights how bedtime procrastination, defined as the tendency to delay sleep without external pressures, affects daytime fatigue linked to sleep deficiency. The study analyzes responses from 399 students, examining the influence of personality traits such as conscientiousness and neuroticism on sleep habits and fatigue levels. Findings suggest that certain aspects of personality, particularly industriousness and orderliness, indirectly contribute to daytime fatigue through bedtime procrastination, while other traits directly affect fatigue levels.
