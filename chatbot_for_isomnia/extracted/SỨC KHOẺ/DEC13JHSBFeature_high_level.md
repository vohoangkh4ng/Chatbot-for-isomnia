# Title: Social Ties and Adolescent Sleep Disruption

## Summary: This article examines the impact of social ties on the sleep patterns of adolescents, highlighting that teens tend to go to bed later, get less sleep, and experience more daytime sleepiness. While medical research has focused on biological factors influencing sleep disruption, this study emphasizes the significance of social relationships, such as those with parents, peers, and schools, in shaping healthy sleep behaviors. Using a sample of 974 teens, the research suggests that social relational factors are more influential than developmental factors in determining sleep patterns during adolescence. The findings underscore the need for further exploration of the role of social ties in adolescent health behaviors.
