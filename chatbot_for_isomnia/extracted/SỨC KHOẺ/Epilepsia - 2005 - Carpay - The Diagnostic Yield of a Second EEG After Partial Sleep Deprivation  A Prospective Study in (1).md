## The Diagnostic Yield of a Second EEG After Partial Sleep Deprivation: A Prospective Study in Children with Newly Diagnosed Seizures

### Summary

**Purpose:** To assess the diagnostic yield of a repeated EEG (REPEEG) after partial sleep deprivation (SD) in children and adolescents with one or more seizures who previously had a standard EEG (STDEEG) without epileptiform abnormalities (EAs).

**Methods:** In a prospective, multicentred study, we selected children aged 1 month to 16 years with one or more idiopathic or remote symptomatic newly diagnosed seizures. A REPEEG was recorded in children without EAs in their STDEEG.

**Results:** Of 552 children and adolescents who entered the study, 243 (44%) had a STDEEG without EAs. In 177 (73% of eligible children), REPEEGs were recorded after SD. We found EAs in 61 (34.5%) REPEEGs and new EAs added to the 569 with EAs in the STDEEG. The REPEEG thus added 11% with nonepileptiform abnormalities in five (1%).

The chance of finding EAs increases considerably when a sleep record is obtained. Furthermore, activation of EAs by sleep deprivation (SD) has been reported in adults and in children with suspected epilepsy.

**Conclusions:** One third of REPEEGs yielded new diagnostic information. Partial sleep deprivation was highly effective in inducing sleep, which is important because in many cases EAs were found only during EEG recording in sleep. The procedure was safe and convenient.

### Setting
The departments of child neurology and clinical neurophysiology of one children's hospital, one general hospital, and two university hospitals participated in the study.

### Patients
We prospectively selected children with idiopathic or remote symptomatic newly diagnosed seizures, aged 1 month to 16 years, who were seen at our centers between August 1988 and 1992. Children were referred by general practitioners and pediatricians or came directly to our emergency departments. We excluded children with neonatal or acute symptomatic seizures, children referred from another hospital, children with a history of epilepsy, children seen after one seizure, and children with an interval between the seizure and the first clinic visit of >3 months. A diagnosis of a first epileptic seizure or epilepsy (two or more unprovoked seizures) was made by a committee of child neurologists by using predefined diagnostic criteria. Seizures were classified according to the revised international classification. Epilepsy was classified according to the classification proposed by Gastaut. When this was clinically acceptable, medication was not given until after the EEGs were recorded.

### EEG recording and description
Scalp EEGs were recorded on 16- to 21-channel machines by using the international 10-20 electrode placement system. Intermittent photic stimulation was performed in all EEGs, and hyperventilation was induced when the child was cooperative. First, a routine interictal EEG was recorded (STDEEG). The child was allowed to sleep during the STDEEG, but no special efforts to obtain a sleep record were made. When the STDEEG was classified to be without EAs (spikes or spike and wave complexes or both), an REPEEG was recorded by using an age-dependent protocol of SD:

- 0-2 years of age: the REPEEG was recorded during the usual time for the child to have an afternoon nap;
- 3-10 years: the child was allowed to sleep for a maximum of 7 h during the night before the REPEEG recording;
- 11-15 years: the child was allowed to sleep for a maximum of 5 hours of sleep during the night before the REPEEG recording.

### Statistics
All data were analyzed by using SPSS. Tests of significance of differences between groups were made by using χ² analysis. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05.

## RESULTS
Of 560 eligible children who entered the study, 552 STDEEGs were available. Mean age was 6.0 years (SD, 4.1 years), and 48% were boys. In 309 (56%) children, the STDEEG showed EAs (with or without other, nonepileptiform abnormalities); in 88 (16%) children, the STDEEG showed EAs (with or without other, nonepileptiform abnormalities), and in 155 (28%), the STDEEG was normal. Thus 243 (44%) children had an STDEEG without EA. There was a significant difference in the STDEEG results between children seen after a first seizure (n = 138) and children with epilepsy (n = 414; p = 0.005). EAs were found more often in the STDEEGs of children with epilepsy (59%) as compared with the first-seizure group (46%). There was a significant association between epilepsy classification and STDEEG results. REPEATED EEG IN CHILDHOOD SEIZURES

(p = O.OOOl), and idiopathic epilepsy (n = 311) was more often associated with a normal STDEEG than symptomatic epilepsy (n = 209). STDEEG results were also significantly different for various seizure types (p = 0.0001): percentages of STDEEGs with EAs ranged from 44% for generalized tonic-clonic seizures (n = 353), 59% for complex partial seizures (n = 51), 68% for simple partial seizures (n = 28), 85% for myoclonic or atonic seizures (n = 59), to 92% for absences (n = 61). Thus distribution of seizure type and some other clinical characteristics were different between the STDEEG and REPEEG groups because of our selection criteria for recording an REPEEG. No important differences emerged for age, sex, and the number of children younger than 3 years between the STDEEG and REPEEG groups.

The REPEEG showed EAs in 35 (30%) of 118 patients when the STDEEG had been normal and showed EAs in 26 (44%) of 59 when the STDEEG had showed nonepileptiform abnormalities, but this showed only marginally significant (p = 0.057). Results of the REPEEGs were significantly different for children with different types of epilepsy (p = 0.01). EAs were found more often in REPEEGs of children with idiopathic origin than in children with remote symptomatic cause (36 vs. 27%). When we controlled for the results of the STDEEG, however, these differences were no longer significant: There was no significant difference in REPEEG results between children with different seizure types.

In 109 (20%) of 552 STDEEG recordings, the child slept during part of the recording. A sleep tracing was obtained in 144 (81%) of 177 REPEEGs. Results of the REPEEGs were significantly different between children with and without sleep tracings in their REPEEGs (p = 0.001). Children showing EAs in their REPEEGs were more likely to have slept during the recording. Of the children with a normal REPEEG, 27% remained awake during the REPEEG recording, as compared with 5% in children showing EAs and 19% in children showing only nonepileptiform abnormalities in their REPEEGs. Of the children who slept during the STDEEG, 68% did not sleep; during the REPEEG, stage III or IV sleep was not reached by 45%. All children who slept during the recording procedure spent fair amounts of sleep in stages I or II.

The results of the REPEEG and the relation to diagnosis (first seizure or epilepsy) and STDEEG results are shown in Table 1.

STDEEG, first EEG using standard procedures with no special efforts to obtain a sleep recording; REPEEG, second EEG after age-dependent partial deprivation of sleep in children with a standard EEG without epileptiform abnormalities; EAs, epileptiform abnormalities; NonEAs, nonepileptiform abnormalities; EAs include REPEEGs with epileptiform abnormalities that also showed other, nonepileptiform abnormalities. ### Results

EAs occurred both while awake and asleep in 17 (28%) children. Twenty-nine (16%) of 177 children had nonepileptiform focal abnormalities in the REPEEGs, 15 with EAs and 14 combined with EAs. These occurred when awake only in nine (31%), when asleep only in four (14%), and when both awake and asleep in 16 (55%). Results of the REPEEGs were not significantly different for children younger than 3 years (n = 55) and children older than 3 years (n = 122).

### Safety

One child had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure on the evening before the REPEEG when he was kept awake, and the same child had a seizure during the REPEEG recording. No further adverse events possibly related to the procedure were noted. Our age-dependent protocol of SD resulted in sleep tracings in 80% of the REPEEGs. In agreement with the literature, we found that in many cases EAs were present only in sleep tracings of the REPEEGs.

### Discussion

We describe the diagnostic yield of a sleep-deprived EEG after a standard (usually awake) EEG. Patients were children or adolescents with one or more newly diagnosed seizures. We recorded an REPEEG only when the STDEEG showed no EAs, as was the case in 449 of 552 children. The REPEEGs showed EAs in 34%. This is in accordance with some of the earlier reports in the literature on REPEEGs after SD in children with suspected epilepsy. Geller et al. reported EAs in 32% of 25 children aged 4-14 years. Tartara et al. found EAs in REPEEGs after SD in 46% of 87 children aged 3 to 18 years. However, other authors found much higher percentages of EAs in their REPEEGs after SD, up to 75% in two studies.

Several possible drawbacks to the use of SD were considered. Niedermeyer warned that especially children may be so fatigued after SD that they fall into the less informative deep-sleep stages almost immediately. Our study, using an age-dependent protocol of SD, does not confirm this observation, as 55% of the children did not enter sleep stages III or IV at all during the REPEEG recording. In the remaining 45%, there was a reasonable amount of recording time in sleep stages I and II. Most authors who reported on a study of EEG after SD did not mention any complications of the procedure or stated that the procedure was found to be harmless. However, Tartara et al. reported five children who had seizures after SD (6% of the sample). Given the low risk of serious complications of seizures in general and the low incidence of provoked generalized tonic-clonic seizures in our study, we believe the risk of using partial age-dependent SD in children is acceptable.

The fact that in some cases the REPEEGs after SD showed EAs when the STDEEG did not is no proof of activation by SD. Such finding might also be explained by a sampling effect because of repeated and prolonged recording, because interictal EAs are not present constantly in time. Pratt et al. estimated that a sampling effect could explain about 20% of the discrepancies. REPEATED EEG IN CHILDHOOD SEIZURES

one fifth of new EEG abnormalities after SD. Our study was designed not to demonstrate that SD is a true activating procedure but to audit the yield of a protocol in the diagnostic workup of children with seizures. Recording an REPEEG after partial, age-dependent SD was a safe and useful diagnostic procedure in adolescents.

STDEEGs showed EAs in 309 (56%) patients, and the REPEEGs added another 61 (11%) with EAs. Thus the combination of an STDEEG and an REPEEG in our study resulted in 679 with identified EAs. New nonepileptiform abnormalities were found in five (4%) REPEEGs, only 1% of the total cohort.
