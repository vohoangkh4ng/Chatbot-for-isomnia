# Title: Dietary and Activity Factors Influence Poor Sleep and the Sleep-Obesity Nexus among Children

## Summary: This article investigates the impact of behavioral factors such as physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet on sleep outcomes and the relationship between sleep and obesity in children. The study involved 2,253 students aged 8.8 to 13.5 years, who completed questionnaires regarding their health behaviors and underwent anthropometric measurements. Findings indicate that increased screen time, especially in bed, and higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with a greater likelihood of sleep problems and obesity. The research underscores the importance of addressing these behaviors to improve children's sleep quality and weight status.
