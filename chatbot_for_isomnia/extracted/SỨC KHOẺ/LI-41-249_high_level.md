# Title: Shedding light on the prevalence of coâ€‘morbid insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea

## Summary: This editorial discusses the significant overlap between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and insomnia, highlighting the challenges in diagnosing and treating these co-occurring sleep disorders. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing their co-morbidity, as failure to do so can complicate OSA treatment and reduce patient compliance with therapies like positive airway pressure (PAP). The article reviews findings from a study conducted at Lokmanya Tilak Medical College, which revealed that 25% of OSA patients also exhibit insomnia symptoms, with a notable prevalence among females. The editorial advocates for integrated treatment approaches that address both conditions to improve patient outcomes.
