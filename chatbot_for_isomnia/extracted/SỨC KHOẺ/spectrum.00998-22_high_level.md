# Title: Multiomics Analysis Reveals Aberrant Metabolism and Immunity Linked Gut Microbiota with Insomnia

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between gut microbiota, serum metabolism, and inflammatory factors in insomnia. It reveals that insomnia patients exhibit distinct gut microbiota compositions and metabolic pathways compared to healthy individuals. Notably, certain bacteria such as Lactobacillus and specific metabolic pathways were found to be significantly altered in insomniacs. The research highlights the role of immune factors, particularly IL-1b and TNF-a, in mediating the connection between gut microbiota and insomnia, suggesting that inflammation and metabolites may link the gut microbiome to insomnia. These findings provide new insights into the potential microbiome-related causes of insomnia.
