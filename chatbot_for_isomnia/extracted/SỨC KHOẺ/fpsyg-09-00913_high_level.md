# Title: The Relationship Between Trait Procrastination, Internet Use, and Psychological Functioning: Results From a Community Sample of German Adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the connection between trait procrastination, Internet multitasking, and psychological functioning among adolescents. It finds that adolescents with high levels of procrastination are more likely to engage in multitasking with Internet applications, which can negatively impact their mental health. Specifically, insufficiently controlled Internet use was identified as a partial mediator in the relationship between procrastination and psychological issues such as stress, sleep quality, and parental relationship satisfaction. The findings suggest that high trait procrastination may increase the risk of adverse outcomes related to uncontrolled Internet use.
