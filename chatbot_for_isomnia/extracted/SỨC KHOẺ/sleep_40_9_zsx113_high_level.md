# Title: Social Media Use Before Bed and Sleep Disturbance Among Young Adults in the United States: A Nationally Representative Study

## Summary: This study investigates the independent association between social media (SM) use in the 30 minutes before bed and sleep disturbance among young adults aged 19-32 in the United States. The research, involving a nationally representative sample of 1,763 participants, found that frequent SM use before bedtime is linked to increased sleep disturbance, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.62 for those who often check SM compared to those who rarely do. The findings suggest that targeting SM use reduction in the period before bed may be a feasible strategy for improving sleep quality, highlighting the need for further research to explore the mechanisms behind this association.
