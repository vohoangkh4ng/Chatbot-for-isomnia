# Title: Sleep Well, Study Well: A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Studies on the Interplay between Sleep and School Experience in Adolescence

## Summary: This systematic review examines the reciprocal and longitudinal associations between sleep and various aspects of school experience in adolescents. It highlights how poor sleep quality and disturbances can negatively impact school engagement, performance, and increase issues like burnout and absenteeism. Conversely, factors related to the school environment, such as psychological stress and structural characteristics, can adversely affect adolescents' sleep quality and duration. The findings underscore the need for further longitudinal research to explore the bidirectional relationship between sleep health and school experiences.
