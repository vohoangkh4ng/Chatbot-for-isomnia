# Title: Adolescent sleep duration: associations with social-cognitive determinants and the mediating role of sleep hygiene practices

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between social-cognitive determinants and sleep duration among adolescents, highlighting the role of sleep hygiene practices as mediators. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these factors to develop effective interventions for improving sleep health in adolescents. Data from 878 adolescents across 10 Dutch high schools were analyzed, revealing that most social-cognitive factors were linked to longer sleep duration, with sleep hygiene practices mediating these associations. The findings suggest that addressing social-cognitive elements is crucial in promoting better sleep duration among adolescents.
