# Title: Narcissism and problematic social media use: A systematic literature review

## Summary: This article presents the first systematic review examining the relationship between narcissism and Problematic Social Media Use (PSMU). It synthesizes findings from 14 empirical studies, revealing a positive association between grandiose narcissism and Problematic Facebook Use (PFU). The review highlights inconsistencies in the effects of narcissism across different social media platforms and emphasizes the need for caution in interpreting results due to the limited number of studies and the predominance of cross-sectional designs. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the potential risks associated with social media use among individuals with narcissistic traits.
