# Title: Screen Time and Sleep among School-Aged Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Literature Review

## Summary: This article systematically reviews the scientific literature on the relationship between screen time and sleep outcomes in school-aged children and adolescents. Analyzing 67 studies published from 1999 to early 2014, the authors found that 90% of the studies indicated a negative association between screen time and sleep, particularly in terms of reduced sleep duration and delayed sleep timing. The review highlights variations in results based on factors such as screen type, age, gender, and day of the week. It also discusses the limitations of current research, including the lack of confirmed causal relationships and measurement errors. The authors recommend that youth limit screen time, especially before bedtime, and call for future research to address existing methodological issues to inform policies and interventions regarding screen time among young people.
