# Title: Differential effects of split and continuous sleep on neurobehavioral function and glucose tolerance in sleep-restricted adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of different sleep schedules on cognitive performance and glucose tolerance in adolescents experiencing sleep restriction. It compares continuous sleep with a split sleep schedule (night sleep plus an afternoon nap) over a series of nights. Findings indicate that while adolescents with a split sleep schedule performed better in cognitive tasks and reported less sleepiness, they exhibited higher blood glucose levels during glucose tolerance tests compared to those with continuous sleep. The results suggest that the way sleep is apportioned can significantly affect neurobehavioral outcomes and metabolic health in adolescents.
