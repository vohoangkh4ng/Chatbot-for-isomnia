# Title: Neural Reward Processing Mediates the Relationship between Insomnia Symptoms and Depression in Adolescence

## Summary: This study investigates the connection between insomnia symptoms and depression in adolescent girls, focusing on how disrupted neural reward processing may serve as a mechanism for this relationship. Using longitudinal data from 123 participants, the research finds that nonrestorative sleep (NRS) in early adolescence is linked to altered brain responses during reward anticipation and increased depressive symptoms later in adolescence. The findings suggest that NRS may impair reward processing in the prefrontal cortex, contributing to the development of depression, while highlighting the need to differentiate between nonrestorative sleep and nocturnal insomnia symptoms in future research.
