# Title: Digital media use and sleep in late adolescence and young adulthood: A systematic review

## Summary: This article presents a systematic review of the impact of digital media use on sleep among adolescents and young adults aged 16-25. It synthesizes findings from 60 observational studies, focusing on various sleep outcomes such as sleep duration, quality, and disturbances. The review concludes that increased digital media use, particularly through mobile phones and social media, is associated with shorter sleep duration and poorer sleep quality. The authors highlight the need for further research to clarify causal relationships and underlying mechanisms affecting sleep in this demographic.
