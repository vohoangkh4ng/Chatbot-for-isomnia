# Title: The role of insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment in obesity

## Summary: This article reviews the impact of insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment on obesity and metabolic health. It highlights that traditional risk factors like excess energy intake and lack of physical activity do not fully account for the rising obesity rates. Insufficient sleep, defined as sleeping less than the recommended amount, and circadian misalignment, where wakefulness and food intake occur at times contrary to the body's internal clock, are significant contributors to poor metabolic health. The review discusses their effects on appetite hormones, energy expenditure, and food choices, while also suggesting strategies to mitigate these adverse effects and emphasizing the need for further research in this area.
