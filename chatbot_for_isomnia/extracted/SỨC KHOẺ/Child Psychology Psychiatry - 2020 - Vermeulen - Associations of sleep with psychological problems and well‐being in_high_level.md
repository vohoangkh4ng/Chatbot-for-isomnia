# Title: Associations of sleep with psychological problems and well-being in adolescence: causality or common genetic predispositions?

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between sleep quality and psychological functioning in adolescents, utilizing a discordant monozygotic twin design. It analyzes data from 12,803 adolescent twins over two years, revealing that while short and problematic sleep are associated with worse psychological outcomes, the findings suggest that sleep quality is a more critical factor than sleep duration. The results indicate that increases in sleep problems in one twin correlate with significant increases in internalizing and externalizing problems, highlighting the importance of targeting sleep quality for prevention and intervention in adolescent mental health.
