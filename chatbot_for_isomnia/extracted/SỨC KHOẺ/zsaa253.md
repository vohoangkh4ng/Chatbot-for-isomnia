# Abstract
## Study Objectives
This study examines the relationship between experimentally manipulated sleep duration and mood in adolescents.

## Methods
Thirty-four adolescents (20 male), aged 15–17 years, lived in a sleep laboratory for 10 days and 9 nights. They were allocated to one of three sleep “doses” for five consecutive nights for 5, 7.5, or 10 h sleep opportunity per night. Two baseline nights and two recovery nights entailed 10 h sleep opportunity per night. Mood was measured every 3 h during wake using unipolar visual analogue scales measuring the mood states “depressed,” “afraid,” “angry,” “confused,” “anxious,” “happy,” and “energetic.”

## Results
Mixed models analyses with post hoc comparisons revealed that participants in the 5-h group, but not the 7.5- or 10-h groups, reported being significantly more depressed, angry, and confused during sleep restriction than at baseline. Adolescents were significantly less happy and energetic during sleep restricted to 5 h and significantly less energetic during sleep restricted to 7.5 h. When adolescents had 10 h sleep opportunities their happiness significantly increased. No statistically significant effects of sleep restriction were found for fear or anxiety, although small-to-moderate effects of sleep restricted to 5 or 7.5 h were found. Two nights of recovery sleep was not sufficient to recover from increased negative mood states for the 5-h group, although recovery occurred for positive mood states.

## Conclusions
Given the prevalence of insufficient sleep and the rising incidence of mood disorders and dysregulation in adolescents, these findings highlight the importance of sufficient sleep to mitigate these risks.

# Statement of Significance
Adolescence is a critical maturational stage in terms of heightened risk of the onset of mood disorders. Insufficient experimental evidence exists that elucidates the effect of sleep duration on a range of positive and negative mood states in adolescents. The present study uses sleep restriction and sleep extension protocols to experimentally manipulate sleep duration in 34 adolescents. Results indicated that adolescents reported deteriorated in terms of depression, happiness, anger, confusion and energy. Two nights of recovery sleep did not eliminate mood deficits for negative mood states for the 5-h group, although recovery occurred for positive mood states. Sufficient sleep is crucial to guard against mood deficits in otherwise healthy adolescents.

Adolescence is a time of significant psychological, social, and physiological change and a vulnerable developmental period during which individuals are at heightened risk of developing a mental illness. Despite the importance of mood and the commonly held belief that sleep loss perturbs adolescent mood, rigorous experimental evidence supporting a causal relationship between sleep loss and mood deficits in adolescents is scant. The current experiment tests the causal association between sleep duration and adolescent mood.

Empirical literature on sleep duration and mood has overwhelmingly focused on adults; however, adult findings may not generalize to adolescents. Adolescents differ in terms of their greater sleep need, types of affective challenges they face, and less mature prefrontal brain regions that are crucial to affective regulation. As such, research focusing specifically on adolescents is needed. Most of the extant literature focusing on sleep duration and mood in adolescents is cross-sectional. These studies report a correlation of sleep duration and mood, with shorter sleep associated with worse mood. Due to the cross-sectional nature of such studies, however, a casual relationship cannot be concluded.

A recent study investigated the effect of sleep restriction and sleep extension on a group of 48 adolescents aged 14–17 years with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder using a 3-week sleep protocol with an experimental crossover design in participants’ homes. Sleep restriction involved a week with a 6.5 h sleep opportunity per night while sleep extension involved a week of 9.5 h sleep opportunities per night. Parent- and self-reported depressive symptoms were greater during sleep restriction compared to sleep extension, while positive affect was lower. Parents also reported increased negative affect and emotion dysregulation among adolescents during sleep restriction when compared to extension.

Among the limited experimental studies including adolescents, two were performed under continuous monitoring. The sleep of 113 adolescents, aged 15–19 years, was restricted to a 5-h sleep opportunity for seven consecutive nights, with or without a 1-h daytime nap opportunity. Mood was assessed three times per day using Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS). Compared to controls, who had 9-h sleep opportunity per night, sleep-restricted adolescents reported significantly lower positive mood scores. The detriment to positive mood was only partially ameliorated by an afternoon nap. Unexpectedly, no change was observed to negative mood. Lo et al. note that adolescents reported that many of the mood states assessed by the PANAS negative mood subscale, such as guilty, afraid, and scared, were not relevant to them. Differential sensitivity to sleep loss among mood states has been reported in a recent meta-analysis of 361,505 adolescents, with positive mood showing the largest effect in response to shorter sleep, followed by anger, depression, and anxiety. The present literature is limited by the paucity of studies that have examined specific mood states. Other challenges arise in those studies using home-based sleep restriction schedules where breaches of adherence to study protocols regarding sleep and abstinence from napping and caffeine may muddle interpretation.

The present study addresses the gaps and limitations in current literature by employing a laboratory-based experimental design to measure several discrete mood states over varying “doses” of sleep. The laboratory environment ensures adherence to study protocols and control of environmental variables, such as diet, caffeine consumption, and exercise that are known to affect sleep and mood. The repeated-measures design whereby participants in each condition have their mood compared between baseline, the sleep dose condition, and following recovery sleep provides the opportunity for robust conclusions regarding the causal link between sleep duration and mood.

# Methods

# Participants

Participants were 34 adolescents aged 15–17 years (20 male, M age = 15.91 years ± 0.86) from South Australian high schools. All participants were late- or postpubertal adolescents (Tanner Stage 4 or 5 on the Pubertal Development Scale). Prescreening by parent and adolescent self-report showed that participants were physically and psychologically healthy and were medication-free, with the exception of birth control. Participants were good sleepers, with average sleep durations ≥8 h per night, average sleep onset latencies of ≤30 min per night, and weeknight/weekend bedtime discrepancy less than 2 h, as determined by a survey and a 7-day sleep diary during screening, to reduce confounding effects of preexisting poor sleep and/or sleep disorders. Extreme morning or evening chronotypes were not included due to effects of chronotype on adolescent sleep and mood, nor were participants indicating less than 8 h sleep per night on average, weekend bedtime delay of 2 h or more, or sleep onset latencies greater than 30 min per night.

# Materials and measures

Mood was measured using a series of 100 mm unipolar visual analog scale (VAS), similar to those used in a study by Stern et al. These consisted of scales with labels to demonstrate the spectrum of discrete mood experience, with “Not at all (mood)” at the left endpoint and “Extremely (mood)” on the right endpoint. Mood states included “Depressed,” “Afraid,” “Angry,” “Confused,” “Anxious,” “Happy,” and “Energetic.”

At each test administration, participants were asked to describe how they felt “RIGHT NOW” by marking a short vertical line intersecting the scale at some point, placing the mark further to the right to reflect the greater intensity of that mood. Items were scored by measuring the distance in millimeters from the left anchor of the scale to the point at which the participant intersects the scale with a line. Unipolar scales (i.e. spanning the range of not at all sad to extremely sad, as opposed to bipolar scales which may span happy to sad) were selected as they reduce participant confusion as compared to a bipolar scale. Sleep was recorded prior to the laboratory experiment with sleep diaries, actigraphy, and by getting participants to call and leave a message on the sleep laboratory answering machine confirming their and waketime. During the laboratory experiment, sleep was recorded using nightly polysomnography. Further information regarding sleep measurement is provided elsewhere.

## Design
This study used a mixed experimental design. The independent variables were sleep duration dose (5, 7.5, and 10 h groups), and sleep condition (Baseline, Experimental Sleep, and Recovery); dependent variables were the mood terms: “Depressed,” “Afraid,” “Angry,” “Confused,” “Anxious,” “Happy,” and “Energetic.”

## Statistical analyses
Linear mixed-effects models were used to test differences in mood across sleep conditions (baseline, sleep restriction, and recovery) for both males and females. This analytic approach accounted for both within and between-participant variance. All models specified a random effect of subject ID. Models for mood specified “Depressed,” “Afraid,” “Angry,” “Confused,” “Anxious,” “Happy,” and “Energetic” as dependent variables. Each model was fully saturated, including all main and interaction effects, for sleep dose (5, 7.5, and 10 h), sleep condition (baseline, sleep restriction, and recovery), and sex. Baseline data collected on day 2 were excluded to reduce acclimatization effects as participants adjusted to a novel environment. Cohen’s d was calculated to indicate effect size.

## Procedure
An active recruitment process was used to recruit adolescent participants through announcements in South Australian high-school newsletters. Parents of potential participants provided an initial telephone screen using the Sleep, Medical, Educational, and Family History Survey. Adolescent participants meeting preliminary inclusion criteria were sent a questionnaire package that included a modified Sleep Habits Survey, the Smith Composite Morningness/Eveningness questionnaire, the Pubertal Development Scale and the Sleep, Medical, Education and Family History Survey and a 7-day sleep diary and were invited to attend an interview. Upon confirming eligibility and obtaining parental consent and adolescent assent, adolescents were provided a sleep diary and a wrist activity monitor for the week prior to the in-lab study. Participants were allocated in blocks of four participants to one of the three sleep-dose conditions. Adolescents in each study run were in the same condition and were not informed of their sleep opportunity each night until the end of the study. Adolescents were required to maintain a 9.5 h sleep opportunity between 9:30 pm and 07:00 am for five nights prior to the study to eliminate any existing sleep debt before the start of the study. Thirty-seven participants (21 males) were recruited; however, one did not follow the required pre-study sleep protocol and was excluded from the study and two others (both females assigned to the 7.5 h condition) discontinued their participation before the study’s conclusion.

On the first two of nine consecutive laboratory nights, a 10 h sleep opportunity was provided to extinguish any residual sleep debt and provide baseline sleep and mood data. Adolescents’ polysomnographically estimated sleep durations on the adaptation and baseline nights were not significantly different between conditions. Five experimental nights of 5, 7.5, or 10 h sleep opportunity followed, with wake time at 7:30 am regardless of sleep duration. This wake time was chosen to simulate typical rising early for school, as adolescents generally restrict sleep by staying up late rather than getting up early. Two recovery nights of 10 h sleep opportunity concluded the experiment. The VAS was administered three-hourly across all wake periods.

## Results
Results are presented for the interactions between sleep dose group (i.e. 5, 7.5, or 10 h) and study phase (baseline, sleep restriction, or recovery) in Tables 1–2 and Figure 2. Noted differences refer to statistical significance at a p < .05 level. Effect sizes are presented using Cohen’s d, where .2, .5, and .8 indicate a small, medium, and large effect size, respectively.

### Sleep duration and negative mood
Descriptive statistics for all mood states are provided in the Supplementary Material, and inferential statistics with post hoc test results are provided in Table 1. Figure 2 illustrates the effect size of the changes in mood states between baseline and experimental sleep dose across the three groups. Overall, the change to mood states across the phases of the study (baseline, experimental sleep dose, and recovery) varied between experimental sleep dose groups for depressed mood, anger, and confusion, but not fear or anxiety. Specifically, participants reported greater depressed mood, anger, and confusion during the experimental sleep dose when compared to baseline, but this effect was only seen when sleep was restricted to 5 h TIB and not during the 7.5 h sleep dose. Depressed mood and fear also increased from experimental sleep dose to recovery for participants in the 5 h group. Confusion increased during recovery when compared to baseline and experimental sleep dose for participants in the 10 h group. No significant changes to other mood states were found between experimental sleep dose and recovery in the 7.5 or 10 h sleep groups. Figure 1.

Participants’ happiness increased from baseline to experimental sleep dose in the 10 h sleep dose (control group), and there was a small but nonsignificant increase in energy. Significant increases in happiness and energy also occurred between the experimental sleep period and recovery for adolescents in the 5 and 7.5 h sleep dose groups, while happiness increased between the sleep dose phase and recovery for participants in the 7.5 and 10 h groups.

Discussion

The aim of the current study was to explore the effect of five nights of sleep limited to either a 5, 7.5, or 10 h sleep opportunity per night on adolescent mood, when compared with baseline and recovery conditions which had 10-h sleep opportunities. Consistent with previous research, positive moods of happiness and energy significantly decreased when sleep was restricted to 5 h sleep opportunity per night, with large effect sizes for both moods. This finding is consistent with results found in adult studies that used a VAS to measure mood, establishing the sensitivity of happiness and energy to sleep loss. It is interesting to note that, although obtaining less than the recommended 8–10 h sleep per night, positive moods only decreased for energy but not happiness in the 7.5 h group, although a small-to-medium effect size was observed. Conversely, happiness, but not energy, increased from baseline to experimental sleep dose in the 10 h control group, suggesting that when adolescents consistently have the opportunity to obtain optimal sleep, happiness increases. Results regarding negative mood states of depression, fear, anger, confusion, and anxiety were mixed. Participants in the 5 h group were significantly more depressed, angry, and confused when restricted to 5 h TIB compared to baseline, with large effect sizes for all changes. Likewise, extant research has found that depressed mood, anger, and confusion increased in response to less sleep. Similar to results found for positive moods, no changes to negative mood states were observed in the 7.5-h group between baseline and experimental sleep dose, despite not obtaining the recommended duration of sleep. This highlights the importance of considering positive mood states in research into the impact of sleep on mood and also has important clinical ramifications, given the role of anhedonia in psychological disorders such as depression.

Fear and anxiety did not increase during the experimental sleep phase for adolescents in the 5 or 7.5 h sleep dose groups. Findings in regard to the sensitivity of anxiety to sleep loss have been mixed. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, experimental studies have struggled to replicate cross-sectional results linking less sleep to increased negative mood in adolescents. A lack of significant findings in some moods may be a result of a differential sensitivity. It is possible that the “dosage” and chronicity of sleep restriction implemented in the current study, as well as previous experimental research, were sufficient to elicit an increase in depressed mood, anger, and confusion in adolescents, but not fear or anxiety. More chronic sleep restriction may be required to find observable effects. It is important to note that while statistical significance was not reached, the effect size for the increase in anxiety from baseline to sleep restriction was medium for the 5 h group and small for the 7.5 h group, thus part of this nonsignificant finding may also reflect a lack of statistical power in the current analyses.

Another possible explanation for the lack of a significant relationship between sleep duration and fear and anxiety has been suggested. It is argued that individual differences can predict mood responses to restricted sleep, such as a phenomenon where stressful life events influence the development of a person’s genes, making them more susceptible to mood disturbances upon reduced sleep. Restricting sleep reduces cognitive resources needed to dismiss negative stimuli, and those susceptible individuals, having biased attention for negativity, become less able to regulate or reappraise them. This is supported by findings that the greatest variance in the relationship between sleep duration and anxiety was accounted for by genetic factors. As the participants recruited for the current study underwent an extensive screening process, ensuring physical and psychological health, this may have minimized the possibility that individuals at higher risk of mood and/or sleep disorders would be included.

The current study was able to control for many of the confounding factors, which may have influenced the outcomes of prior adolescent sleep research. No other identified adolescent study examining the effect of sleep on mood was completed entirely under laboratory conditions. As such, previous studies were not able to control for exposure to environmental variables and diet, such as caffeine or excessive sugar to the same degree. The laboratory conditions allowed enforced bed/wake times, permitting stronger causal conclusions to be made about the effect of sleep duration on mood without having to consider response biases inflating relationships between subjective sleep and mood measures when both sleep and mood are measured subjectively. However, laboratory conditions present additional challenges, with reduced ecological validity.

Some of the challenges of the laboratory environment in measuring mood outcomes include the effect of an unfamiliar environment, socializing with peers who are not part of their normal friendship groups, and lack of contact with friends and family, which could have been confounding factors in the effect of sleep restriction on mood. It is a possibility that in a more familiar environment, such as participants’ homes, we may expect to see a more ecologically valid indication of the effect of sleep on mood; however, this comes at a cost of greater exposure to extraneous variables. Nonetheless, the inclusion of 7.5 and 10 h sleep dose groups provides a direct comparison between. conditions to test the independent effects of sleep “dose” on mood and helps to distinguish between the effects of sleep loss and what may result simply from being in a laboratory environment for an extended period. An important consideration regarding the current study is that the screening process ensured that participants were both physically and psychologically healthy. Although this is important to minimize exposure to at-risk individuals and to control for confounding variables, it is possible that the sample of the current study was more impervious or resilient to many of the mood disturbances often associated with inadequate sleep. As such, mood effects witnessed in the present study may have been felt more acutely in at-risk individuals, as indicated by prior research.

Patterns of cumulative sleep loss are increasingly prevalent among adolescents. The current study found that, when restricted to 5 h sleep for five nights, adolescents’ happiness and energy decreased, depressed mood, anger, and confusion increased, while fear and anxiety did not change. For participants in the 7.5 sleep dose, no significant changes to positive or negative moods were observed between baseline and sleep restriction conditions, and this degree of sleep restriction may require a longer period of time to observe detrimental effects to mood. It is important to note that, while statistical significance was not reached, small-to-medium effect sizes in changes to these mood states were observed between baseline and sleep restriction in the 7.5-h condition. As such, we cannot be sure that, over an extended period of time, that sleep restricted to 7.5 h sleep opportunity per night may not be damaging to mental health.

The implications of the effect of sleep duration on mood relate to the increasing incidence of both sleep loss and mood disorders in adolescents, suggesting a greater need for awareness, support, and intervention in promoting healthy sleep for adolescents. In addition, findings of the current study demonstrate the rapidity of mood decline when adolescent sleep is restricted to 5 h per night, while a more modest amount of sleep loss may require an extended period to see similar effects. Given the prevalence of insufficient sleep and the rising incidence of mood disorders and dysregulation in adolescents, these findings highlight the importance of sufficient sleep to mitigate these risks.
