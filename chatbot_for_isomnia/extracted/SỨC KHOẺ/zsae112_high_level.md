# Title: Trajectories of actigraphy-derived sleep duration, quality, and variability from childhood to adolescence: downstream effects on mental health

## Summary: This article examines the growth trajectories of sleep parameters—specifically sleep duration, efficiency, and variability—during childhood and adolescence. It investigates how these trajectories differ based on race/ethnicity and sex, and their predictive effects on mental health outcomes. The study finds significant changes in sleep patterns over time, with notable declines in sleep duration and improvements in sleep efficiency. Additionally, it highlights that Black and male youth experience more pronounced declines in sleep duration and variability compared to their peers. The findings underscore the importance of understanding these sleep trajectories in relation to internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms.
