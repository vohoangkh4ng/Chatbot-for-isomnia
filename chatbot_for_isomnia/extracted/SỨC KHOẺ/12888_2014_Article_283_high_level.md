# Title: Sleep complaints in adolescent depression: one year naturalistic follow-up study

## Summary: This study investigates the prevalence and longitudinal course of sleep complaints in adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). Following a sample of 166 adolescents over one year, the research finds that sleep complaints were less frequent at follow-up compared to baseline. Interestingly, baseline sleep complaints did not negatively impact clinical outcomes; instead, they were associated with greater improvements in depressive and anxiety symptoms over time. The study suggests that sleep disturbances may not necessarily predict poorer clinical outcomes in depressed adolescents, highlighting the need for larger studies to further explore the relationship between sleep and depression.
