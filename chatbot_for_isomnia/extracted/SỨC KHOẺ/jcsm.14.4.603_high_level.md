# Title: Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges of Sighted Non–24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder

## Summary: This article discusses the diagnostic and treatment challenges associated with sighted non–24-hour sleep-wake disorder (N24SWD). It presents a series of seven clinically evaluated patients, highlighting their delayed sleep-wake patterns and the effectiveness of timed melatonin and bright light therapy in entraining their sleep-wake schedules. Despite initial success in treatment, long-term adherence and effectiveness remain low due to the complexities of maintaining stable circadian rhythms. The study emphasizes the need for better understanding and clinical tools to address this often-overlooked disorder, which significantly impacts daily functioning and quality of life.
