# Title: Preliminary Results: The Impact of Smartphone Use and Short-Wavelength Light during the Evening on Circadian Rhythm, Sleep and Alertness

## Summary: This article presents preliminary findings on how smartphone usage and exposure to short-wavelength light in the evening affect circadian rhythms, sleep, and alertness. The study involved 14 male participants who read on smartphones with and without blue light filters, as well as on printed material, before bedtime. Results indicated that reading on smartphones decreased subjective sleepiness but did not significantly affect objective alertness. Notably, cortisol levels were elevated after reading on smartphones without a filter, while reading printed material increased evening melatonin and improved sleep physiology. The findings suggest that short-wavelength light impacts sleep and alertness, and using a blue light filter may mitigate some negative effects.
