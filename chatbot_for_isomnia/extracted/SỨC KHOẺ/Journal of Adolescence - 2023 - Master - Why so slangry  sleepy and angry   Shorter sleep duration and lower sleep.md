# Why so slangry (sleepy and angry)? Shorter sleep duration and lower sleep efficiency predict worse next‐day mood in adolescents

## Abstract

**Purpose:** The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationships of actigraphic nighttime sleep duration and quality with next‐day mood among urban adolescents using a micro‐longitudinal design.

**Methods:** A subsample (N = 525) of participants from the Fragile Families & Child Wellbeing Study (mean age: 15.4 years; 53% female; 42% Black non‐Hispanic, 24% Hispanic/Latino, 19% White non‐Hispanic) in the United States between 2014 and 2016 concurrently wore a wrist actigraphic sleep monitor and rated their daily mood in electronic diaries for about 1 week. Multilevel models tested the within‐person temporal associations of nightly sleep duration and sleep maintenance efficiency with next‐day reports of happiness, anger, and loneliness. The models also tested the between‐person associations of sleep variables and mood. Models adjusted for sociodemographic and household characteristics, weekend, and school year.

**Results:** After nights when adolescents obtained longer sleep duration than their usual, they reported lower ratings of anger (B = –.03, p < .01) the next day. After nights when adolescents had higher sleep maintenance efficiency than their usual, they reported higher ratings of happiness (B = .02, p < .01) the next day. Adolescents who had longer average sleep duration reported lower ratings of anger (B = –.08, p < .01) and loneliness (B = –.08, p < .01) compared to others. There was no within‐person association of sleep duration or efficiency with loneliness. Sleep duration was not associated with happiness between adolescents, and sleep maintenance efficiency was not associated with any mood measure between adolescents.

**Conclusions:** Improvements to nightly sleep may help increase happiness and decrease anger the following day in adolescents. Promoting sleep health is recommended to improve mood.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Adolescence is an integral developmental period for emotional regulation, which can be challenging when coupled with age‐associated mood variability and diminished self‐control. Adolescents who have difficulty with emotional control, anger, and loneliness are at greater risk for unhealthy behaviors, such as substance abuse, gambling, and video game addiction. A study examining adolescents from three rural high schools found that anger was positively associated with drug use and negatively associated with perceived family support, self‐esteem, and optimism. Loneliness, which is frequently experienced in adolescence, is associated with an increased risk of mental health problems, poorer self‐rated health, and higher odds of high cholesterol, blood pressure, and being overweight or obese in early adulthood. In contrast, positive moods, such as happiness, are related to numerous healthy behaviors during adolescence, including increased physical activity, healthier eating habits, and less smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as behavioral and emotional engagement, flourishing, and resilience toward academic challenges. Despite the emotional difficulties adolescents frequently experience and their consequences, research suggests that certain modifiable health behaviors such as sufficient sleep duration and quality have been shown to promote emotional wellbeing. The current study builds on existing research by examining how sleep and mood are associated at the daily (within‐person) and average (between‐person) levels in a large sample of adolescents.

A growing body of evidence demonstrates why there may be a link between sleep and emotional health. Using fMRI, found that the amygdala, an area of the brain responsible for processing adverse stimuli, was significantly more active during exposure to negative images in participants who were acutely sleep deprived than participants who were assigned to a sleep‐as‐usual control group. Sleep loss is also thought to impair the encoding of positive emotional stimuli, which can consequently allow for negative emotional memory dominance. Experimental studies in adolescent samples without fMRI support these findings; adolescents were more likely to report worsened mood during a sleep restricted condition compared to a sleep extension or baseline condition. Outside of the laboratory, observational research in adolescents has shown that sleep duration is associated with average mood. In these studies, shorter self‐reported sleep duration was associated with less happiness, greater anger, greater anxious symptoms, and more internalizing behaviors. A study examining mood before and after a school start time delay demonstrated that longer sleep duration after the delay was associated with lower odds of depressive mood. Furthermore, recent studies have addressed the importance of sleep quality and mood in adolescents. One large study found that self‐reported difficulty sleeping and sleep disturbance were associated with higher loneliness. Another found that higher subjective sleep quality was associated with higher levels of positive affect and happiness and lower levels of negative affect.

Adolescents often do not obtain the recommended 8–10 h of sleep, which likely negatively impacts average mood. Little is known regarding how nighttime sleep predicts mood the next day within the same adolescent, particularly in nonexperimental settings. Some studies examined associations between sleep and mood in an adolescents' typical environment using daily, repeated‐measures designs that addressed this gap. Micro‐longitudinal designs are needed given that between‐person effects examined in cross‐sectional research do not necessarily translate to within‐person effects in size or direction. In one study, adolescents reported less anxiety on days when they obtained longer self‐reported nighttime sleep than their own usual, even when controlling for the previous day's anxiety. Similarly, adolescents who reported lower sleep quality were more likely to report more negative affect and loneliness the next day. There is some daily‐level research investigating whether objectively measured sleep duration and quality, versus self‐reported sleep, predicts next‐day mood within that adolescent, as self‐reported sleep can deviate considerably from sleep measured objectively. However, results from these micro‐longitudinal studies in adolescents are mixed. In one recent study using actigraphy and subjective measures, shorter self‐reported sleep duration, but not objectively measured sleep duration or efficiency, was associated with more negative mood the next day; neither sleep duration nor quality (measured objectively or subjectively) was associated with happiness the next day. Another study found that objective sleep duration and efficiency were predictors of next‐day stress. Moreover, in a sample of youth diagnosed with anxiety or depression, longer objectively measured sleep duration was associated with more positive mood (reports of happy, joyful, excited, and energetic) but not negative affect the next day. The association was null in healthy controls, suggesting that sleep may be especially crucial for a growing population of adolescents with anxiety or depression. Lastly, one study examining the bidirectional associations of sleep with positive and negative affect found that afternoon affect predicted that night's sleep, but total sleep time and sleep efficiency did not significantly predict next‐day affect when measured with actigraphy.

The current study extends the sleep and mood literature by examining the daily relationship of two objectively measured sleep variables with three distinct and meaningful mood measures in one of the largest samples of diverse adolescents across the United States thus far. Prior research suggests that the complex relationship between daily sleep and mood may vary based on different adolescent populations, how data are collected and measured, and sleep and mood variable characteristics. This study investigates how objectively measured nighttime sleep interval duration and sleep maintenance efficiency are associated with next‐day mood and between‐person associations of these facets of sleep health with average mood per adolescent. We hypothesize that when an adolescent sleeps longer and more efficiently than their average, they report better mood the following day (higher ratings of happiness; lower anger and loneliness); and adolescents who on average sleep longer and more efficiently report better average mood than those who obtain shorter and less efficient sleep. Secondary analyses evaluate whether happiness, anger, and loneliness are associated with that night's sleep interval duration and sleep maintenance efficiency, since previous studies found that the association between sleep and mood or affect in adolescents may be bidirectional. Exploratory, post hoc analyses test whether sex, race/ethnicity, and number of valid days a participant provided moderate the daily relationship between nighttime sleep and next‐day mood.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Study participants
Participants were enrolled in the larger Fragile Families & Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), a longitudinal study of children born between 1998 and 2000 in 20 US cities, oversampled to include a large proportion of unmarried mothers and racial/ethnic minority, low‐income, and less‐educated mothers. Mothers who enrolled in the study were interviewed within 2 days of the child's birth, and follow‐up interviews were conducted in waves when the cohort reached ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15 years old. Between 2014 and 2016, when participants were approximately 15 years old, a randomly selected sub‐sample of 1090 adolescents from the FFCWS were asked to concurrently wear an accelerometer on their nondominant wrist and complete an electronic daily diary once a day for 7 consecutive days, and 1049 adolescents assented. See Table 1 for characteristics of the study sample.

Out of the 1049 assenting adolescents, 10 sleep actigraphy files were lost due to a technical error or device loss, leaving N = 1039 files and N = 1033 with demographic covariate data. The study design required each participant to provide at least three valid sleep and next‐day mood responses to better estimate an individual's regular sleep and mood patterns. N = 812 provided at least 3 valid actigraphy days, and of these, 525 adolescents provided nonmissing next‐day mood values, leaving 50% of the subsample who assented to the sleep actigraphy study. Adolescents in our study provided an average of 6.4 ± 1.3 daily reports of mood (3385 daily observations) and an average of 5.4 ± 1.5 days of valid sleep actigraphy aligned with next‐day mood (range 3–9 days), yielding a total of 2817 daily observations (N = 525). Sixty‐nine percent of our sample (N = 363) provided at least 5 days of valid sleep actigraphy with next‐day mood, a recommended number of days for reliable actigraphy assessment.

Separate logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate whether sex, race/ethnicity, family structure, primary caregiver's education, or income predicted exclusion from the analyses due to data missingness (included n = 525; excluded n = 524). Male sex (OR = 1.29, p = .039), non‐Hispanic Black (OR = 1.73, p = .010) and Hispanic/Latino (OR = 1.75, p = .019) versus non‐Hispanic White race/ethnicity, caregiver's education of high school or equivalent (OR = 1.80, p = .006) versus college or graduate school education, and lower household income (<49% of the poverty level vs. >300%; OR = 1.98, p < .001) predicted higher odds of data missingness. All analyses adjusted for these demographic characteristics.

### Actigraphic sleep measures
Study participants were asked to wear an accelerometer (Actiwatch Spectrum; Philips Respironics) on their nondominant wrist continuously for 1 week. Devices were returned and data were downloaded with Philips Actiware software (Version 6.0.4, Philips Respironics, 2017). Sleep data were recorded and downloaded at the 30‐s epoch level and scored by two independent scorers using a validated procedure and detailed elsewhere, without using bedtime and wake time information from a sleep diary. As a general rule, scorers determined cut‐point, validity of days, and set sleep intervals after data were processed using a SAS‐based hierarchical algorithm to identity sleep periods. Next, scorers adjudicated each recording for interrater agreement by verifying number of valid days, cut‐point, number of sleep intervals, and differences greater than 15 min for each sleep interval duration. A third scorer adjudicated any remaining discrepancies. A day was considered invalid if there were ≥4 total hours of device‐detected off‐wrist time (with the exception of the first and last day of data collection), device or data download failure, or an off‐wrist period of ≥1 h within 10 min of the scored beginning or end of the nighttime sleep period for that day. A daily nighttime sleep interval represented the sleep interval with the longest duration that overlapped the hours of 10 p.m and 8 a.m in a 24‐h cut‐point day due to rare instances of daytime nap intervals being longer than a sleep interval during typical night hours.

Nighttime sleep interval duration was calculated as the number of hours between first falling asleep (sleep onset) and waking up the following day (sleep offset), and includes nighttime awakenings. Nighttime sleep interval duration will hereafter be referred to as sleep duration.

Nighttime sleep maintenance efficiency was defined as the percentage of time spent asleep after first falling asleep (sleep onset) and before waking up (sleep offset) the next day.

over the participant's time in bed interval, which includes sleep onset latency, sleep maintenance efficiency was calculated as the nighttime sleep duration interval (in minutes) minus nighttime wake‐after‐sleep‐onset (in minutes), then divided by the nighttime sleep duration interval and multiplied by 100 to produce a percentage.

2.3        |    Daily diary mood measures
Adolescents were asked to complete an electronic diary through an authenticated website link each evening after 7:00 p.m. (19:00) and before going to sleep. The section on mood explained, “This list describes feelings or experiences. Mark the selection that best describes how you felt during the day” and presented “Angry/Mad,” “Lonely,” and “Happy.” Each mood | Characteristic                     | Percentage |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| Male                               | 47%        |
| Black non-Hispanic                 | 42%        |
| Hispanic and/or Latino             | 24%        |
| White non-Hispanic                 | 19%        |
| Other, mixed, or no reported race  | 15%        | ethnicity. The average age was 15.4 years (SD = 0.5 years). On average, adolescents had 7.8 h of sleep duration (SD = 1.1 h) and sleep maintenance efficiency of 90.9% (SD = 2.8%) per night. The sample average of the three mood ratings (scale: 1–5) were: Happy, 3.2 (SD = 0.9); angry, 1.6 (SD = 0.7); lonely, 1.5 (SD = 0.8). The Intra‐Class Correlations (ICCs) for mood variables ranged from 0.37 to 0.48 (angry: 0.37, happy: 0.44, lonely: 0.48) and the sleep variables ranged from 0.15 to 0.51. Therefore, there was considerable within‐person variation in most of these variables, which supports examining the variation within adolescents across time.

## Daily associations of sleep duration predicting next‐day mood
Table 2 displays results of multilevel models examining whether nighttime sleep duration predicted next‐day mood. At the within‐person level, longer sleep duration was associated with lower ratings of anger the following day (B = –0.03, p < .01; see Figure 1). That is, when an adolescent slept 1 h longer than their own individual average, they reported a 0.03 lower rating of anger the following day. Sleep duration did not predict happiness (B = –0.01, p = .42) or loneliness (B = 0.003, p = .73) the next day.

## Daily associations of sleep maintenance efficiency predicting next‐day mood
Table 3 shows results of multilevel models examining whether nighttime sleep maintenance efficiency predicted next‐day mood. At the within‐person level, higher sleep maintenance efficiency was associated with higher ratings of happiness the following day (B = 0.02, p < .01; see Figure 1). That is, when an adolescent slept 1% more efficiently than their own individual average, they reported a .02 higher happiness rating the following day. Within‐person sleep maintenance efficiency was not associated with ratings of anger (B = –0.01, p = .28) or loneliness (B = –0.004, p = .51).

## Between‐person associations in sleep to next‐day mood models
Tables 2 and 3 also provide results of between‐person associations of sleep duration and efficiency with mood. On average, sleep duration was inversely associated with anger (B = –0.08, p < .01) and loneliness (B = –0.08, p < .01); thus, participants with longer average sleep duration than the sample mean reported significantly lower ratings of anger and loneliness. There were no between‐person associations between sleep maintenance efficiency and mood. Some models demonstrated significant covariate effects (see full description in Supporting Information and Tables 2 and 3).

## Associations of mood predicting that night's sleep
Each of the six multilevel models examining the daily association between daytime mood (anger, happiness, and loneliness) and that night's sleep (sleep duration and sleep maintenance efficiency) were null (p > .05). However, comparable to model results where sleep was the predictor and mood was the outcome, higher average ratings of anger (B = –0.15, p < .05) and loneliness (B = –0.21, p < .01) were associated with shorter average sleep duration at the between‐person level.

## Exploratory analyses of moderating effects of sleep with next‐day mood
In post hoc analyses, we examined the moderating impact of sex, race/ethnicity, and number of valid days on the relationship between sleep duration or efficiency with next‐day mood. For more details, see Supporting Information and Tables S1 and S2.

## DISCUSSION
Our primary analyses examined the daily associations between nightly actigraphic sleep and next‐day ratings of mood in a large, diverse sample of adolescents. Results revealed that after adolescents had longer sleep duration than their average, they reported lower ratings of anger the next day. Additionally, when adolescents slept more efficiently than their average, they reported higher happiness ratings the following day. However, there was no association between sleep duration and next‐day happiness or loneliness; nor were there associations of sleep efficiency with next‐day anger and loneliness. Our results suggest that nighttime sleep health may acutely predict adolescent emotional wellbeing at the daily level.

during this critical developmental period may increase happiness and reduce anger, potentially protecting against unhealthy behaviors and risk of disease in adulthood.
The inverse association between sleep duration and next‐day anger observed in our study is consistent with several studies finding an association between poor sleep (measured objectively or through self‐report) and negative mood the following day and supports our first hypothesis. While most daily‐level research in this area focuses on the relationship between sleep and negative mood or affect, some studies have also found a relationship between sleep duration and next‐day happiness or positive affect, an association that was null in our study. Instead, those who slept more efficiently than their average were happier the following day. Our results highlight the importance of not only sleep duration at the daily level for optimal mood, but also sleep quality, as measured by sleep maintenance efficiency. Our study is one of the first to reveal a daily association between objectively measured sleep efficiency and positive mood the following day in adolescents. While participants in the current study were not experimentally sleep deprived, it is possible that the increased anger and reduced happiness exhibited by adolescents in the current study after shorter sleep duration or lower sleep efficiency than their usual was promoted by overactivity to adverse experiences in the emotion‐regulation centers of the brain. Still, further research is necessary to identify why sleep duration (but not efficiency) predicts next‐day JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE

**FIGURE 1** Nighttime sleep variables and next‐day mood. Multilevel models examined the within‐person association between a given night's sleep interval duration or sleep maintenance efficiency and next‐day ratings of mood. Significant within‐person findings (p < .05) are displayed in adjusted regression plots with 95% confidence intervals. Models adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, primary caregiver's education level, family structure, household income, school year, and weekdays/weekends. Nighttime sleep maintenance efficiency (left) was defined as the percentage of time spent asleep after first falling asleep and before waking up the next day and positively predicted next‐day happiness. Nighttime sleep interval duration (right) was calculated as the number of hours between first falling asleep and waking up the following day (including nighttime awakenings) and negatively predicted next‐day anger.

anger, and why sleep efficiency (and not duration) predicts next‐day happiness in adolescents. While our results suggest daily associations between sleep and mood, our within‐ and between‐person effect sizes were small and may not be clinically significant in this sample. However, considering that sleep deficiency is common during adolescence, even small shifts in mood may matter at a population level.

In support of our between‐person hypothesis, we found that adolescents with longer sleep duration reported less anger on average. The finding is consistent with prior literature, as sleep deprived adolescents report greater negative affect and anger than rested controls. In a recent review paper examining the relationship between sleep duration and mood in adolescents, shorter sleep duration increased the odds of experiencing negative mood by 55%, including depression, anxiety, and anger. Fuligni et al. estimated that 9 h of sleep (measured by self‐report) each night was needed for optimal mood in adolescents. Therefore, promoting sleep strategies and programs to increase the amount of sleep duration that adolescents typically achieve may boost positive mood and reduce negative mood, which may also simultaneously reduce the risk of future adverse outcomes and health risks, such as obesity, poor academic performance, and suicidality.

The current study revealed that those who had higher average ratings of loneliness had shorter average sleep duration, consistent with previous findings. While most prior research on this topic found associations between self‐reported sleep problems and loneliness, objectively measured sleep efficiency was not associated with loneliness in either within‐ or between‐person models. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which sleep is associated with loneliness during adolescence, or if this association is confounded by characteristics such as social support.

In our secondary analyses, we found that mood did not predict that night's sleep. These null results differ from a previous study in youth diagnosed with depression that found that higher daytime positive affect was associated with more time in bed. In contrast, another study found that higher high‐arousal positive affect predicted shorter objectively measured total sleep time. Furthermore, Kouros et al. found that higher ratings of happiness were associated with fewer self‐reported sleep/wake problems and lower objective sleep efficiency, and more negative mood was associated with more self‐reported sleep/wake problems, longer objective sleep duration, and higher objective sleep efficiency that night. It could be that the null association between mood and that night's sleep observed in the current study was due to analyzing individual mood items instead of a general affect scale (PANAS) similarly used in other studies, or differences in our sample population.

Post hoc, exploratory results showed that sex, race/ethnicity, and number of valid days interacted with sleep duration and quality and next‐day mood. Sex had a moderating effect on the link between sleep efficiency (but not sleep duration) and next‐day mood. While primary analyses found that there was a significant, positive main effect of nighttime sleep efficiency with next‐day happiness, moderation analyses suggested this relationship was primarily driven by male adolescents. Thus, males' mood may benefit more than females from better daily sleep quality.

Race/ethnicity was also a significant moderator in three of the six supplemental models. Compared to White adolescents whose next‐day happiness and loneliness were significantly improved following nights of longer than usual sleep, Black adolescents reported lower next‐day happiness and relatively reduced improvement in loneliness. Similarly, relative to the stronger association of sleep duration and next‐day loneliness observed among White adolescents, the association among Other race adolescents was weaker. When examining the association between sleep efficiency and next‐day loneliness, Hispanic/Latino adolescents were more likely to report feeling more lonely than usual when their previous nights' sleep efficiency was above average; this association was opposite in White adolescents, where improved sleep efficiency was associated with reduced next‐day loneliness. Lastly, while the number of valid days a participant provided was a significant moderator in only one of the six sleep‐to‐next‐day mood models (sleep duration and happiness), the exploratory results demonstrate the importance of collecting daily data over a longer period of time, with access to more valid days per participant, to fully understand the strength of daily relationships between sleep and mood. These moderation analyses should be interpreted with caution given the number of variables, new interaction terms, and models tested, which could have resulted in false positives. Future research in other large, diverse samples should further examine the moderating effects of demographic features on sleep and next‐day mood outcomes. The current study has notable strengths. Whereas most literature on the relationship between adolescent sleep and mood utilizes cross‐sectional data, the current study used micro‐longitudinal data, allowing for the testing of both individual‐level and between‐person differences simultaneously. Therefore, we were able to determine how changes from an individual's average in sleep duration or efficiency can influence their next‐day mood, while also controlling for between‐person differences. Additionally, our study included an objective measure of sleep efficiency, while most studies examining the relationship between sleep and mood only assess sleep duration. Adolescents in our study wore actigraphic devices on their wrist to objectively measure sleep while completing a diary each evening in an ecologically valid protocol more relevant to everyday life than a laboratory study. Our large sample of racially and ethnically diverse adolescents is a major strength to this study, as our findings may be generalized to vulnerable individuals, many of whom may face challenges obtaining restful sleep.

Our study had some limitations. We required a minimum of three valid nights of sleep actigraphy and next‐day diary per adolescent to be included in analyses, rather than the recommended minimum of five valid nights for reliable actigraphy assessment used in some studies. Future studies should consider asking participants to report on daily mood and wear accelerometers for a longer period of time (i.e., more than 1 week) to ensure several consecutive days of valid sleep and mood data. Such longer data collection would allow for additional analyses, such as modeling the bidirectional associations between daily sleep and mood simultaneously (providing more information than the current study) and examining the effects of school attendance on the sleep‐mood relationship. Randomized‐controlled intervention studies are also necessary to strengthen the causal inferences about the sleep and mood association. While our study consisted of a unique and diverse sample, only 50% of the 1049 adolescents who assented to the sleep actigraphy study were included in our analyses due to missing data; therefore, the adolescents included in our study may represent a subgroup and results may not be generalizable to the entire sample. Additionally, while the daily mood questions in our study are similar to a short version of the Profile of Mood States, they have not been directly validated, and only offer a 5‐point Likert scale once a day as a response. It may be more appropriate in future studies to include questions that can be averaged together to produce a daily affect measure, such as a “positive affect” construct composed of individual items querying levels of happiness, joy, excitement, and energy. Furthermore, it may be more precise to involve ecological momentary assessment methods to aggregate several reports of mood asked throughout the day, rather than asking participants to fill out retrospective reports at the end of the day. Lastly, we scored sleep periods without the assistance of a daily diary; therefore, we do not have a measure of time in bed, sleep onset latency, or the traditional measurement of sleep efficiency.

Our findings indicate that sleep duration and efficiency are important predictors of next‐day mood in adolescents. We found that an individual's day‐to‐day sleep duration and sleep maintenance efficiency predicted better mood, and average sleep duration was associated with better overall emotional wellbeing. Promoting healthy sleep hygiene to ensure sufficient duration and high‐efficiency sleep may benefit acute mood in adolescents. DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT
