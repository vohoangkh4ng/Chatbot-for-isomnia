# Title: Impact of Adolescentsâ€™ Screen Time and Nocturnal Mobile Phone-Related Awakenings on Sleep and General Health Symptoms: A Prospective Cohort Study

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between adolescents' screen time, nocturnal mobile phone use, and the development of sleep problems and health symptoms. Utilizing data from the Swiss HERMES cohort, the research found that adolescents experiencing nocturnal awakenings from mobile phones were significantly more likely to develop issues such as restless sleep and difficulties falling asleep. Additionally, high screen time was associated with various health symptoms, including lack of energy and concentration. The findings suggest that increased screen time and mobile phone-related disturbances negatively impact adolescent sleep and health, although the authors caution that natural changes in circadian rhythms may also play a role.
