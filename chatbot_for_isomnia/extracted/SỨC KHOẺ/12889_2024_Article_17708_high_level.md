# Title: The efficacy of sleep lifestyle interventions for the management of overweight or obesity in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis

## Summary: This article investigates the effectiveness of sleep interventions, either alone or as part of broader lifestyle changes, in managing overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. Despite the recognized link between inadequate sleep and obesity risk, the study found mixed results regarding the impact of sleep interventions on body mass index (BMI) and other weight-related outcomes. The systematic review included eight studies with a total of 2,231 participants, revealing no significant overall effect on BMI from sleep interventions, highlighting the need for further research to isolate sleep as a treatment component.
