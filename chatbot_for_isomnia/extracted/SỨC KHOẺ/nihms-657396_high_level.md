# Title: Adverse childhood experiences are associated with adult sleep disorders: a systematic review

## Summary: This article presents a systematic review examining the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and sleep disorders in adulthood, particularly focusing on women. The review identifies 30 studies, predominantly retrospective, that indicate a significant association between various sleep disorders and a history of childhood adversity. The findings suggest that the severity and number of adverse experiences correlate with increased risk of sleep issues, including insomnia and sleep apnea. The authors emphasize the need for trauma-informed care for affected individuals and call for further longitudinal studies to explore this association across diverse populations.
