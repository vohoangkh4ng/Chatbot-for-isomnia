## Shedding light on the prevalence of co‑morbid insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and insomnia are prevalent sleep disorders in the general population. There has been encouraging improvement in the awareness of these disorders around the world. The overlap of insomnia and sleep apnoea (COMISA) has been recognised since 1973; however, it is only now that we are starting to recognise the implications of this overlap. This may not also be evident at the initial presentation as many symptoms and features of both these conditions overlap, delaying the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that OSA symptoms may often have a different onset from that of the co‑occurring sleep disorder, which may also vary over time independently from each other.

Moreover, in many regions including the subcontinent, these disorders have traditionally been managed by different medical streams with sleep apnoea being managed mostly by respiratory physicians and insomnia by psychiatrists and neurologists. It is therefore easy to overlook the co‑existence of these important and common sleep disorders. Failure to recognize their co‑occurrence can complicate OSA treatment, diminishing compliance with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, particularly when insomnia symptoms are not adequately addressed alongside. Therefore, Dr Thorve and team deserve accolades for highlighting this at their institute.

It is thought that in patients with sleep apnoea the augmented breathing in response to apnoea was associated with general arousal and often complete awakening, resulting in loss of sleep. Patients may initially present with the primary features of sleep apnoea (snoring, fragmented sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness) and later insomnia (disturbed or unrefreshing sleep) later. Also, it can be the other way around where patients may first present with insomnia and later be diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Studies have highlighted differences in these cohorts with males dominating the first group and females the second group.

Interestingly, Bjornsdottir et al. examined and followed insomnia symptoms among patients with OSA prior to treatment. They highlighted distinct subtypes of insomnia — initial insomnia, middle insomnia, and late insomnia — each characterised by specific sleep difficulties.

## INSOMNIA IN UNTREATED OSA PATIENTS

They proposed that OSA could potentially trigger each subtype of insomnia. Conversely, they suggested that different insomnia subtypes might influence adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in OSA patients, indicating a bidirectional and a dynamic relationship.

They also illustrated that PAP treatment effectively alleviated symptoms of middle insomnia in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. However, symptoms of initial and late insomnia often persisted despite treatment and negatively impacted adherence. Targeted insomnia treatment alongside PAP therapy could benefit patients with comorbid obstructive sleep apnoea and insomnia, potentially enhancing treatment adherence.

The study conducted at Lokmanya Tilak Medical College and Hospital, Mumbai, provided valuable insights into the prevalence and characteristics of COMISA among patients with diagnosed OSA. Utilizing polysomnography and clinical assessments, the researchers found that 25% of OSA patients also exhibited symptoms of insomnia which is in line with studies around the world. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing and addressing COMISA as a significant subset of sleep disorders even in the Indian population.

Consistent with most other studies gender emerged as a notable factor in the study’s findings, with females exhibiting a higher prevalence of COMISA compared to males. This advances the argument for the need for further exploration into gender‑specific manifestations and treatment considerations within the realm of sleep disorders. Furthermore, the study explored the association between obesity and COMISA, revealing a statistically significant correlation. This underscores the intricate interplay between physiological factors and sleep pathology, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive evaluations in clinical practice. Clinicians should suspect the presence of comorbidities in OSA patients whenever symptoms persist despite adequate treatment.

While the study provides valuable insights, it is not without limitations. The relatively small sample size and the selection bias inherent in recruiting patients already diagnosed with OSA may affect the generalizability of the findings. Future research efforts should aim to overcome these limitations through larger, population‑based studies to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of COMISA prevalence and its impact.

The study has done well to underscore the importance of addressing COMISA as a distinct clinical entity requiring tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. By expanding our understanding of COMISA prevalence, risk factors, and treatment outcomes, clinicians can enhance patient care and improve overall health outcomes in individuals affected by these debilitating sleep disorders.
