# Title: Excessive Daytime Sleepiness and Insomnia Symptoms in Adolescents With Major Depressive Disorder: Prevalence, Clinical Correlates, and the Relationship With Psychiatric Medications Use

## Summary: This study investigates the prevalence and clinical correlates of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and insomnia symptoms in adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). Conducted with a sample of 297 adolescents, the findings reveal that 39.7% experience EDS and 38.0% report insomnia symptoms. The study identifies significant associations between EDS and factors such as higher body mass index, severity of depressive symptoms, and the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Insomnia symptoms are linked to female sex, previous suicide attempts, and severity of depressive symptoms, while negatively associated with antipsychotic use. The authors emphasize the need for regular screening and management of these symptoms to improve clinical outcomes in this population.
