# Title: Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Trial on the Effect of Proteins with Different Tryptophan/Large Neutral Amino Acid Ratios on Sleep in Adolescents: The PROTMORPHEUS Study

## Summary: This clinical trial investigates the impact of varying ratios of tryptophan (Trp) to large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) in protein on sleep quality and circadian rhythms in adolescents. The study focuses on two groups: elite rugby players and youths with obesity, both of whom are prone to sleep disturbances. Participants will undergo a controlled dietary intervention to assess how different protein compositions affect sleep efficiency, measured through in-home EEG recordings, along with other sleep-related and metabolic evaluations. The findings aim to inform nutritional strategies for improving sleep among adolescents.
