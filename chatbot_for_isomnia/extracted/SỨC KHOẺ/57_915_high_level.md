# Title: Subjective sleep duration and quality influence diet composition and circulating adipocytokines and ghrelin levels in teen-age girls

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between sleep duration and quality, dietary habits, and hormonal levels related to obesity in lean and obese teenage girls in Saudi Arabia. The research involved 126 participants aged 14-18, who completed questionnaires on sleep and diet, and underwent anthropometric measurements and blood tests. Findings indicate that shorter sleep duration is associated with higher carbohydrate intake and altered levels of adipocytokines and ghrelin. Specifically, longer and uninterrupted sleep correlates with healthier dietary choices and a more favorable hormonal profile, highlighting the importance of sleep in managing adolescent obesity.
