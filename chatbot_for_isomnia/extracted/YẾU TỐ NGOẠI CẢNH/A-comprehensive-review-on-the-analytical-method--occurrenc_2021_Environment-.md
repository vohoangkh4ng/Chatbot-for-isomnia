# A comprehensive review on the analytical method, occurrence, transformation and toxicity of a reactive pollutant: BADGE

## A B S T R A C T

Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE)-based epoxy resin is one of the most widely used epoxy resins with an annual production amount of several million tons. Compared with all other legacy or emerging organic compounds, BADGE is special due to its toxicity and high reactivity in the environment. More and more studies are available on its analytical methods, occurrence, transformation and toxicity. Here, we provided a comprehensive review of the current BADGE-related studies, with focus on its production, application, available analytical methods, occurrences in the environment and human specimen, abiotic and biotic transformation, as well as the in vitro and in vivo toxicities. The available data show that BADGE and its derivatives are ubiquitous environmental chemicals and often well detected in human specimens. For their analysis, a water-free sample pre-treatment should be considered to avoid hydrolysis. Additionally, their complex reactions with endogenous metabolites are areas of great interest. To date, the monitoring and further understanding of their transport and fate in the environment are still quite lacking, comparing with its analogues bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS). In terms of toxicity, the summary of its current studies and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ToxCast toxicity database suggests BADGE might be an endocrine disruptor, though more detailed evidence is still needed to confirm this hypothesis in in vivo animal models. Future study of BADGE should focus on its metabolic transformation, reaction with protein and validation of its role as an endocrine disruptor. We believe that the elucidation of BADGEs can greatly enhance our understandings of those reactive compounds in the environment and human.

## 1. Introduction

2,2-bis(4-(2,3-epoxypropyl) phenyl) propane, also known as bisphenol A diglycidyl ether or BADGE. BADGE-based epoxy resin is one of the most widely used epoxy resins in the world. It is a reactive pre-polymer of BPA that is produced through the O-alkylation of BPA with epichlorohydrin. As a high production volume (HPV) chemical in the U.S., the production volume is reported to range from 1,000,000 ~ 20,000,000 lb in 2015. It is widely used as a coating material in food and beverage cans, monomer in the production of epoxy-based polymers and an additive for the elimination of surplus hydrochloric acid in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) organosol production. BADGE can be easily transformed to its hydrolysis products or chlorinated products. Many of the transformation products are highly toxic. Therefore, it is necessary to study the conversion pathway and derivatives of BADGE. Similarly, BADGE-related compound bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) is produced in the reaction between bisphenol F and epichlorohydrin. It can also form hydrolysis products and derivatives such as BFDGE-2H2O and BFDGE-2HCl. The production volume of BFDGE is yet unknown. The chemical structure of BADGE is quite unique with two epoxides (electrophilic oxirane rings), resulting in its high reactivity. This property has been confirmed in an earlier study on its reaction with food components such as protein and amino acids that leads to its ‘disappearance’ in food packaging materials. The analysis of BADGEs has always been a challenge due to these reasons. well as the laboratory background contamination. It is worth noting that majority of the environmental pollutants are non-reactive chemicals and yet we have quite limited knowledge on those reactive chemicals. Many of the emerging organic pollutants (EOPs) are reactive nowadays. For examples, more and more reactive flame retardants showed high-efficient flame retardancy and were proposed as a novel replacement for non-bonded flame-retardants in the market.

Therefore, BADGE could be a classical model to study these reactive chemicals. To date, a limited number of studies have documented the widespread occurrences of BADGEs in the environment and human specimens. A study reported BADGE may be equally or more harmful than BPA in triggering specific toxic effects such as cytotoxicity, raising concerns on its safety. Therefore, an overview on environmental and toxicological studies of BADGE are of great significance to public health and regulation guidance.

There are more and more studies regarding the toxicity of BADGE and its biotransformation. It was reported to be mutagenic, genotoxic and cytotoxic in some cell models. BADGE is also known as an antagonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR γ). In terms of its biotransformation, some studies revealed that a large proportion of BADGE is bio-transformed to many unknown metabolites which are yet to be thoroughly investigated. In one of these studies, less than 10% of BADGE remained unchanged in plasma in rats after oral dosage of 2-14C-propane-labelled BADGE.

The goals of this review are to compile and analyze the current state of knowledge on the occurrence of BADGE and its derivatives in the environment, consumer products, human exposure and toxicity; and to identify knowledge gaps and future research needs. The review is structured into seven topics:

3. Production and applications
3.1. Production of BADGE
Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) is one of the most widely used epoxy resins in the world. It has been listed as a high production volume (HPV) chemical in the U.S. The production volume of BADGE in the U.S. was reported to be 1,000,000 ~ 20,000,000 lb between 2012 and 2015 from the U.S. EPA CDR database. As shown in Fig. 1b, its production volume in 2015 is comparable with BPS (1,000,000 ~).

Additionally, BADGE has many unintended by-products (mainly its hydrolysis and chlorinated products). For example, BADGE has two hydrolysis products BADGE-H2O and BADGE-2H2O. The chlorinated products (i.e., BADGE-HCl, BADGE-2HCl and BADGE-HCl-H2O) are likely to be formed during the thermal coating treatment considering BADGE is also used as an additive to remove the hydrochloric acid. These derivatives are also unstable that can be further hydrolyzed. Table 1

The presence of BADGE-related compounds (BADGEs) is ubiquitous in our daily life. The major application fields of BADGEs are primarily in sealants, coating, paints, fillers for textiles, packaging materials, or even dental filling material. One big concern of BADGE was raised by its application in canned food coating/food packaging materials that can migrate into foods when heated and further consumed by human. Root canal sealers are commonly used to endodontically treat teeth with periapical infections and some materials are based on epoxy resin contain BADGE.

Concentrations of BADGEs were previously determined in 70 dental sealants collected from the U.S. market. Among all the tested compounds, BADGE-2H2O was most abundant, found at concentrations of up to 1,780 μg/g. The geometric mean (GM) concentration of total BADGEs was 47.8 μg/g. Therefore, leaching of these compounds into saliva can be a human exposure pathway. In another source of textiles, concentrations of BADGEs and BFDGEs were determined in 77 textiles and infant clothing collected from Albany, New York, U.S. BFDGE was detected as the predominant compound, with a mean concentration of 13.6 ng/g, followed by BADGE-HCl-H2O (7.32 ng/g) and BADGE-2H2O (1.92 ng/g).

4. Physicochemical properties of BADGEs

The physicochemical properties and structures of BADGEs are summarized in Table 1. In general, the structures of these compounds show high similarity in backbones containing two benzenes, but their side-chain functional groups are different. Both BADGE and BFDGE have epoxide, a cyclic ether with a three-atom ring, which makes them highly reactive. Additionally, these electrophilic oxirane rings are subject to reaction with nucleophilic species. To date, data on experimentally determined physicochemical properties of BADGEs are generally limited. Through calculation, the estimated log Kow values of BADGEs range from 1.34 to 4.57, which all below 5, suggesting that they are less likely to bioaccumulate according to Stockholm Convention. The estimated log Kow of hydrolysis derivatives such as BADGE-H2O, BADGE-2H2O and BFDGE-2H2O is comparably lower, indicating their hydrophilic properties. While BADGE/BFDGE and their chlorohydroxy derivatives are relatively more hydrophobic. The estimated log KOA values of BADGEs range from 12.25 ~ 15.22, suggesting these chemicals are semi-volatile compounds (SVOCs). The BCF values of BADGE and its derivatives range from 1.99 to 887.5. The BCF values of BADGE and some derivatives BADGE-2HCl and BADGE-HCl are comparably higher (> 400 L/kg) while hydrolysis derivatives such as BADGE-2H2O and BFDGE-2H2O are generally low (<10 L/kg). These chemicals are generally not bioaccumulative since the criterion of above 2000 L/kg is considered to be bioaccumulative by the European Union Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) regulation.

5. Analytical method of BADGEs

The analysis of BADGEs as a group of emerging organic contaminants can be quite challenging for a couple of reasons. The first concern is the hydrolysis potential of BADGEs. Two epoxy rings of BADGE are highly reactive and can be hydrolyzed with half-lives of approximately 2 days at pH 7 and 35 ◦C. For solid samples (e.g., dust), a water-free environment during the sample extraction and clean-up steps should be ensured, otherwise can lead to low recovery issues. The second major concern is the widespread use of BADGEs in laboratory environment (e.g., plastic consumables), which often causes background contamination for the trace level analysis. For example, the analyte backgrounds in sulfatase have been reported in urine analysis.

Only a few studies have attempted to investigate the environmental and human occurrences of BADGEs and BFDGEs in different sample matrices. The applied analytical methods were summarized in Table 2. For sample preparation, the solid samples (e.g., dust or sewage sludge) were dried and processed by organic solvent extraction, followed by purification using solid-phase extraction (SPE). To date, only three studies have investigated its occurrences in indoor dust samples. For the first two studies, the dust samples were firstly extracted by a combination of water and methanol, and further diluted with 0.2% formic acid in water before being loaded to a Waters MCX cartridge. This acidified environment accelerates the hydrolysis of unstable BADGEs, which results in low recovery of BADGEs and creates great uncertainty in the absolute quantification. In our previous study, we found a relatively low recovery (30–50%) of BADGE/BFDGE in the SPE column such as HLB cartridge (Waters) and WCX cartridge (Phenomenex). Therefore, we optimized the clean-up steps using a silica gel cartridge to provide a water-free environment for dust analysis. We found that 10 mL of 20% methanol in ethyl acetate was sufficient for the elution of all tested compounds without a great increase in matrix effect. The average recovery of BADGE was 76 ± 2%, 71 ± 6% and 88 ± 23% (Average ± S.D) for the dust samples with high, medium and low levels of BADGE spikes. No obvious hydrolysis was observed. All compounds were detected in standard reference material (SRM 2585) except BFDGE-2HCl and BFDGE-2H2O. A good reproducibility of intra-day and inter-day variabilities of all compounds was also observed (1 ~ 25% and 18 ~ 28% for the former and latter, respectively). Therefore, the water-free method for the dry environmental samples is recommended in future studies. It should be noted that the silica gel used was activated by heating at 180◦C overnight, which might result in irreversible adsorption of the epoxides. Therefore, the deactivated silica gel can also be considered for future studies.

Generally, the analysis methods were different among different matrices. For examples, the indoor air samples (particulate phase) were extracted by ethyl acetate. The BADGEs in water sample were usually extracted by adding into the tetrahydrofuran dissolved with decanoic acid. While for sludge samples, the freeze-dried samples were first extracted with methanol and then purified by SPE. For human biological fluid samples (e.g., urine and blood), one common treatment approach is liquid–liquid extraction using ethyl acetate, followed by a drying process to further concentrate the samples.

As BADGEs are semi-volatile compounds, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) under multiple reaction mode (MRM) is the most frequently used method to quantify BADGEs in different sample matrices. This method offers good sensitivity and suits for the trace-level quantification. Internal standards d6-BADGE or d10-BADGE are the most frequently used in the quantification for BADGE and its derivatives. Considering the different physicochemical properties (e.g. much lower estimated log Kow of hydrolysis derivatives) among BADGE and its derivatives, d6/d10-BADGE may not be the most ideal internal standard for its derivatives. It might be a possible way to fully hydrolyze d6/d10-BADGE (into d6/d10-BADGE-2H2O) for future quantification studies. Usually, a reverse-phase column is incorporated with LC-MS/MS for the separation. In electrospray ionization (ESI), BADGEs and BFDGEs are analyzed in positive ionization mode. In terms of the mobile phase, BADGEs and BFDGEs showed a high tendency to form [M + NH4]+ ion adducts with the mobile phase components. Therefore, the ammonium buffer at 2 mM is often used as a modifier in the mobile phase by enabling the ammonium adducts formation and ensuring signal reproducibility.

a Unless stated, the detection method was electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) in positive mode. 6.1. Occurrence in air and indoor dust

To date, only one study reported the detection of BADGEs and BFDGEs in indoor air. In bulk air, BADGE-2H2O (60%) was the main compound in indoor air among all BADGEs (detection rate [DR]: 85.5%), with a concentration as high as 6.71 ng/m3. The inhalation exposure to BADGE-2H2O for teenagers was estimated as 3.84 ng/kg-bw/day. For other BADGEs, BADGE-H2O, BADGE-HCl-H2O and BADGE-HCl were all detected with a median concentration of 0.13 ng/m3, accounted for 11% of total BADGEs. For BFDGEs, only BFDGE was detected with a median of 0.13 ng/m3.

The occurrences of BADGEs in indoor house dust have been found in several recent studies from countries including the U.S., China, Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Vietnam (Table 3). For all four countries, the general distribution profiles of BADGEs in dust samples are quite similar, with BADGE-2H2O and BADGE-HCl-H2O as the predominant ones. Similarly, the hydrolysis compound BADGE-2H2O was found with the highest median concentrations of 1,920 ng/g in Korea, followed by Japan, the U.S., and China. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of BADGEs via dust ingestion is 6.5 ng/kg-bw/day. In Vietnam, the concentrations of total BADGEs in indoor dust range from 23 to 1,750 ng/g (median 184 ng/g) and the EDI range from 0.158 to 0.736 ng/kg-bw/day. Among four tested BADGEs, BADGE-2H2O (accounted for 72%) was the predominant compounds found in the dust, followed by BADGE-H2O (16%), whereas the percentage of BADGE-H2O only accounted for < 2% to 5% in other studies.

As seen in Fig. 2a, in our study using a water-free method, BADGE-2H2O was also found as the dominant compound, ranging from 214 to 35,419 ng/g with a GM concentration of 1,843 ng/g in the dust from Singapore. The contribution of BADGE-2H2O to total BADGEs ranged from 34% to 96% with an average of 61%. Besides BADGE-2H2O, BADGE-2HCl concentration in dust samples ranged from < 56 to 2,474 ng/g, with a GM concentration of 223 ng/g. In terms of BADGE-2HCl concentration in total BADGEs, the value ranged from 0 to 49%, with an average of 17%. Another transformation product BADGE-HCl-H2O was also detected with concentration ranging from 66 to 1,832 ng/g and a GM of 233 ng/g. As BADGE chlorinated compounds were not tested in previous studies, we revealed a slightly different distribution profiles of all BADGEs in indoor dust. For example, it was found that BADGE-2HCl accounted for approximately 17% of total BADGE concentrations. It should be noted that the dust samples collected in Singapore were all from households while the earlier mentioned studies also included those from supermarkets, laboratories etc.

The concentration of another parent compound BFDGE in dust samples (DR: 44%) range from < 4.9 to 421 ng/g with a GM concentration of 2.5 ng/g, which is one order of magnitude less than BADGE. BFDGE-2H2O concentration in dust samples range from < 0.055 to 130.0 ng/g with a GM concentration of 0.3 ng/g, while BFDGE-2HCl was only detected in one sample with concentration of 903.2 ng/g. In contrast to BADGEs, the parental BFDGE was dominant (average relative contribution > 50%) in 12 of 17 dust samples where BFDGEs were detected, suggesting that the environmental transformation of BFDGE may not be as rapid as BADGE.

In this review, we also compared the occurrence of total BADGEs with other common bisphenol plasticizers. As shown in Fig. 2c, the most abundant bisphenol plasticizers were BPA (1.48 ± 1.19 μg/g) and total BADGEs (1.52 ± 0.81 μg/g), which was followed by BPS (0.33 ± 0.27 μg/g) and bisphenol F (0.12 ± 0.16 μg/g). The detected mean concentrations of other.

To date, there are very few studies reported the level of BADGEs in wastewater and sludge. BADGEs and BFDGEs were determined in wastewater samples (n = 4) and river water samples (n = 3) collected from Spain. None of the targeted compounds was detected in river water samples. In contrast, BADGE was detected in all wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent samples, with the concentration ranging from 0.57 ± 0.04 ~ 1.15 ± 0.1 μg/L. BFDGE was also detected in two WWTP influent samples, with the concentration ranging from non-detected to 0.41 ± 0.06 μg/L. In another study, BADGE and its hydrolysis compounds, as well as BADGE-HCl-H2O, were detected in wastewater samples from two WWTPs in the Albany area of New York State, U.S. BADGE-2H2O was the predominant compound and its GM concentrations in influents was 4.36 ng/L. BADGE-HCl-H2O was the second most abundant chemical found at a GM concentration of 1.72 ng/L. Sludge is usually the sink of hydrophobic SVOCs. BADGE, BFDGE and eight of their derivatives were determined in archived biosolid samples collected from 68 WWTPs in the U.S. Expectedly, BADGE-2HO was the most frequently detected chemical (DR: 99%), with the highest abundance (median: 93.6 ng/g dry weight) among these compounds. In summary, we can draw the conclusion that BADGEs are quite ubiquitous chemicals in the environment.

6.3. BADGEs detected in human biological fluids and adipose tissue

The occurrences of BADGEs have been found in human urine samples collected from the U.S., China, Singapore, Greece and India. In the urine samples collected from the U.S. and China, BADGE-2H2O was the predominant compound, accounting for 45–60% of the total BADGEs concentration, followed by BADGE (17–24%). The urinary concentrations of total BADGEs in the U.S. ranged from 1.24 to 9.03 ng/mL, with a GM concentration of 3 ng/mL. The urinary concentrations of total BADGEs from adults (GM: 1.36 ng/mL) and children (1.02 ng/mL) in China were 3-fold lower than those found in the U.S.. In another study, the occurrence of five BADGE-related compounds, BADGE, BADGE-H2O, BADGE-2H2O, BADGE-HCl-H2O and BADGE-HCl, were found in Greece, with the urinary concentrations of total BADGEs from 0.3 to 20.9 (GM: 0.9) ng/mL. Similarly, in another study that investigated the urinary BADGEs and BFDGEs for Indian children, BADGE and BADGE-2H2O were the predominant compounds among all the analytes. The GM urinary concentrations of BADGE-2H2O and BADGE in Indian children were 12.2 and 24.8 ng/mL, respectively, which were one order of magnitude higher than those reported for Chinese children. In another study conducted in Singapore, total BADGEs were detected in 50% of the urine samples, ranging from < 0.016 to 0.889 ng/mL with a GM concentration of 0.03 ng/mL, which was lower than those found in the U.S. (GM: 1.010 ng/mL), China (GM: 1.073 ~ 1.328 ng/mL) and Greece (GM: 0.900 ng/mL). Total BFDGEs were only detected in 5 urine samples, ranged from < 0.65 to 1.733 ng/mL.

The urinary total BADGEs level was also compared with other bisphenol analogues. In line with the dust results, BPA and BADGE were dominant in human urine samples. Among them, BPA was the most abundant one, with a median concentration of 2.1 ± 0.4 ng/mL. The urinary concentration of total BADGEs (1.08 ± 0.82 ng/mL) was slightly lower than BPA. Similar to dust samples, BADGE level was approximately 2-fold higher than BPS (0.43 ± 0.06) ng/mL but both were lower than BPA in urine samples. Table 39 The concentrations of BADGEs and BFDGEs in different sample matrices collected from different countries.

e Only range was available for wastewater samples. in a few human adipose fat and blood plasma samples collected from New York City, U.S. Similar to the urinary distribution profile, BADGE-2H2O was predominant and detected in 60% and 70% of the adipose and plasma samples, respectively. High concentrations and detection frequencies of BFDGE were also found in both adipose (19.1 ~ 4,500 ng/g) and plasma samples (23.3 ~ 180 ng/g). The occurrence and bioaccumulation of BADGEs or BFDGEs were also examined in 121 tissue samples (including liver, kidney, blubber, and brain) from eight species of marine mammals collected from the U.S. coastal waters of Florida, California, Washington, and Alaska. Among all tested compounds, BADGE-HCl was detected in 78.5% of the samples, at concentrations of up to 2,950 ng/g (wet weight). The favourable organ of BADGEs accumulation was livers, but considerable concentrations of BADGE-2HCl also occurred in brains and kidneys.

In this review, we also compared the concentration ratio profiles of BADGEs in products, environmental samples and human specimens as seen in Fig. 2b. In products, the relative percentage of unstable BADGE derivatives such as BADGE-HCl-H2O (77% for textile; 15% for dental sealants) accounted for relatively higher portion compared with those values in the environmental samples (6% in air; 3.4% in sludge; 10% for dust). The relative percentage of BADGE-HCl-H2O was also lower in human specimens such as urine (11%), blood (0%) and adipose fat (0%). It should be noted that the relative percentage of BADGE in sludge (9%), wastewater (10.6%) and urine (34%) were relatively high, though the exact reason is not clear yet. For sludge or wastewater, it is possible that the adsorption of BADGE to these samples may affect its half-lives of hydrolysis. While regarding the high percentage of BADGE in urine samples, this might due to the relatively short biological half-lives in human.

7.1. BADGE stability and abiotic transformation

We have previously tested the stability of BADGEs by monitoring their hydrolysis products (BADGE-H2O, BADGE-2H2O, BFDGE-2H2O) at pH = 7 and 25 ◦C. A steady decay of BADGE and an increase of BADGE-H2O and BADGE-2H2O were observed in the hydrolysis process, and BFDGE was also observed with the same trend in our study. The half-lives of BADGE and BFDGE were approximately 3 days, which are close to 2 days as estimated in an earlier study. Fast degradation of BADGE was observed in protein-rich and carbohydrate-rich food products. An earlier study has reported its ‘disappearance’ in food packaging materials, which resulted from its reaction with food components such as protein and amino acids. As shown in Fig. 3a, adduct formation was observed in the side chains of N-protected derivatives of cysteine, tyrosine, lysine, histidine and methionine. BADGE also reacts with peptides and proteins in foods. Cysteine was the predominant reaction center for amino acids, peptides and protein. Considering the high reactivity of BADGE, its metabolism may be much more complicated.

7.2. Biotransformation

Although metabolism is one of the important detoxification strategies in organisms, the bioactivity profiles of biotransformed products can sometimes cause more adverse and toxic effects. Comparing with BPA, much less information is available for BADGEs’ metabolisms and toxicities. The degrees of their toxicity are believed to depend mainly on the fractional concentrations of unreacted epoxy groups. Until now, very few studies have documented the metabolism of BADGE and its main metabolites were presumed to be the hydrolysis products.

In vitro bioassays reported that BADGEs exhibit endocrine-disrupting potentials as well as mutagenicity, genotoxicity and cytotoxicity as seen in Fig. 4. Regarding endocrine-disrupting potentials, BADGE and its derivatives exhibit anti-androgenic and estrogenic effects as well as obesogenic properties. For instance, the chlorohydroxy derivatives of BADGE and BFDGE (i.e., BADGE-2HCl and BFDGE-2HCl) can act as an androgen antagonist through the process of binding to the androgen receptor in CHO-K1 cell lines. Additionally, BADGE, BADGE-2H2O and BADGE-2HCl induced proliferation of breast cancer (T47D) cell at concentrations of 10-14-10-4 M, while did not bind to estrogen receptor (ERα) in the binding assay. Some studies have investigated the obesogenic properties of BADGE and suggested these cellular processes may be cell-type specific. For example, BADGE was shown to be an antagonist of PPARγ in the 3 T3-L1 and 3 T3-F442A cells. In contrast, BADGE also exhibits PPARγ agonistic activities in the ECV403 cell line. Although BADGE was considered as a low-affinity ligand that required very high concentrations to demonstrate PPARγ antagonism with half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] of approximately 100 μM. A study revealed its ability to induce adipogenic differentiation in both mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) and preadipocytes at low nanomolar concentrations.

In a recent study, researchers evaluated the direct effects of the bisphenols on Ca2+ signaling in human sperm cells through a Ca2+ fluorimetric assay. The results showed that 10 μM BADGE can induce Ca2+ signals, which almost completely abolished using the effect of CatSper inhibitor RU1968 in human sperm cells. The results suggested that bisphenols such as BADGE can affect Ca2+ signaling in human sperm cells through activation of CatSper.

8. Toxicity
Considering the widespread occurrences and reactivity of BADGEs, it is demanding to systematically review its toxic effects. This section is organized to review both in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies of BADGEs and BFDGEs.

The results suggested that all tested chemicals are able to induce both cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, but their triggered effects are different. The genotoxicity of BADGE is stronger than its hydrolysis products BADGE-HO 2 and BADGE-2H2O while the genotoxicity of BADGE-2HCl is comparable to BADGE-H2O. A study has also reported

and inhibit cell proliferation of human epithelial colorectal adenocar-
cinoma (Caco-2) Cell. Moreover, they found that both chemicals at 200
μM can induce F-actin depolymerization and the effects are potent after
24 h of incubation. A newly published study examined the toxicity,
endocrine and lipid disruption potentials of BADGE, BADGE-H2O and
BADGE-2HCl in human placental cells. In gen-
eral, BADGE-2HCl and BADGE showed higher cytotoxicity than BADGE-
H2O. Additionally, BADGE-2HCl altered the cell lipidome by decreasing
the amount of neutral lipids, while exposure to BADGE increased the
intracellular concentration of triacylglycerides.

We further systematically evaluated the in vitro toxicity of BADGEs
by mining the results from the U.S. EPA Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast).
The active results from those bioassays integrated with
their potency half-maximal activity concentrations (AC50) are shown in
Fig. 5a. Overall, BADGE is able to demonstrate antagonism or agonism
for many receptors such as estrogen receptor (ER), peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and glucocorticoid receptor
(GR). BADGE was also found to be an antagonist of androgen receptor,
which is in agreement with the observed anti-androgenic effect in an
earlier study. In addition, the ability of BADGE to
demonstrate antagonism of PPARγ was also consistent with a previous
study.

8.2. In vivo toxicological studies

In this review, we have summarized the in vivo toxicity results in
Fig. 4. The in vivo systemic toxicity of BADGE has been examined as early
as 1958 for both single-dose and full-dose tests. In the
single-dose oral toxicity test, a median lethal dose (LD50) of BADGE was
higher than 1,000 mg/kg, which was recorded in studies with rats, mice,
and rabbits. In the full-dose test, the oral LD50 for a commercial BADGE-
based epoxy resin was reported to be 11,400 mg/kg in rats, 15,600 mg/
kg in mice, and 19,800 mg/kg in rabbits.

In addition to the acute oral toxicity, accumulated in vivo evidence
suggested BADGE can seriously damage the reproductive systems and
endocrine systems in pigs, rats and native amphibian species. For
example, a study found the plastic bags used for semen storage led to a
significant decrease in fertility for a group of pig farms. The main causal compound responsible for the failures was likely
due to BADGE as an adhesive used to manufacture the multilayer plastic
bags. Additionally, they also found a synergistic reproductive toxicity
effect developed between BADGE, its derivatives, and the cyclic lactone.
Another study investigated the developmental effects of prenatal and
postnatal exposures to BADGE at 375 mg/kg/day orally in male rat
offsprings. Their body weight and relative organ
weight (including lung, adrenal gland, epididymis, prostate, spleen
testis, and brain) have changed in 6 or 9 weeks, and the testicular
toxicity appeared in 9 weeks. BADGE also exhibits acute testis toxicity
for male rats. This study found an increasing number
of immature and maturing sperm on the testis when the male rats were
exposed to the single-dose of BADGE at 750; 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg/
day. However, if below 1,000 mg/kg/day, no significant difference be-
tween the treatment group and control group was observed with respect
to sperm count, headcount, motility and abnormality. In addition,
BADGE has been reported to have adverse effects on Rhinella arenarum in
an embryo-larval development study through standardized bioassays.
The results showed that BADGE was more toxic
to embryos (96 h post-fertilization with median lethal concentrations:
0.04 mg/L) than to larvae (2.2 mg/L) at all exposure times. Significant
lethality rates were also observed for embryos and larvae when exposed
to 0.0005 mg/L and 10 mg/L of BADGE, respectively. In a recent study,
the biological effect of BADGE during development was investigated
using Drosophila. Through whole transcriptome sequencing, differen-
tially expressed genes (DEG) of Drosophila after raising on food con-
taining BADGE were enriched in regulating cell proliferation, including
DNA replication and cell cycle control. Furthermore, raising larvae on
BADGE-containing food induced hemocyte (blood cell) over-
proliferation. Chronic exposure to the BADGE through development
can also induce cell proliferation.

In summary, the toxicological information and mechanism are still
quite limited for BADGE and its derivatives, though the results from a
few endpoints suggested they can be potential endocrine disruptors.
More future studies should be conducted to identify the primary mode of
action of BADGEs. In addition, very little information is available for the
in vitro or in vivo toxicity at the environmentally or human-relevant
levels. In one of our previous studies, we have estimated the relative
contribution of BADGE among 23 common environmental chemicals.
The results showed that BADGE is not that potent as BPA in inducing
metabolic changes to MCF-7 cells. The chemical in-
teractions between BADGE and 12 other xenobiotics were also evalu-
ated. BADGE was found to be more likely to generate antagonist effect
with other chemicals. For examples, the coexposure of BADGE with
parabens compromised their cytotoxicity potency on the HepG2 cell line.

9. Conclusion and future studies

As shown in this review, the production volume or environmental/
human occurrences of BADGEs are similar to or even higher than other
major bisphenol chemicals such as BPS. However, to date, there are still
quite limited studies on investigating these compounds in different
environmental matrices. BPA and BPS were generally very well-studied
while very few studies focused on BADGE (~50). Additionally,
due to the widespread applications of BADGEs in products and limited
monitoring data, it is yet not clear of which exposure pathway (e.g.
dietary intake, dust ingestion or inhalation exposure) is more important
to the entire human exposure. More future environmental monitoring
works are warranted. It is worth noting that a water-free method should
be considered during sampling and pretreatment processes to minimize
the loss of parent BADGE and its unstable derivatives. Considering the
different physicochemical properties among BADGEs, it might be a way
to hydrolyze d6/d10-BADGE (into BADGE-2H2O) as the internal standard
for quantification of its derivatives in the future. In addition, as a
reactive chemical, the migration and emission of BADGE from the
products have not been characterized yet. Comparing with most non-
binding chemical additives such as BPA and flame retardants, which
can be well predicted using the classic partitioning equilibrium in the
environmental and human condition Therefore, the study on the fate of
reactive BADGEs is still lacking.

Another knowledge gap is lying with this question: what are the
implications of BADGEs’ reactivity on their transformation and toxicity?
To date, very few studies have investigated the biotransformation of
BADGE, as summarized above. The identification of these reactive
compounds in the organism is more challenging than some other
traditional xenobiotics due to many unknown rules. Both abiotic and
biotic transformation pathways exist for BADGEs. To date, the biological
half-lives of BADGE and its derivatives in human are yet unknown and
warranted for further studies. In addition, a feasible and robust dis-
covery platform is needed to assist with the identification of the po-
tential metabolites of reactive BADGEs. A fully understanding of their
metabolic pathways will provide a more comprehensive view on the
assessment of their toxicity and potential health consequences as well as
some information on the choice of the suitable biomarker for BADGE
exposure. It is a fact that BADGE-2H2O can be readily detected in human
urine. However, some BADGE-2H2O has already been formed in the
environment. According to the previous studies, it is likely that BADGE
showed a much higher risk than its hydrolysis products. Therefore,
BADGE-2H2O might not be a good biomarker to estimate the potential
risk of BADGE, considering its pre-existence in the environment. The
protein adduct formed by BADGE is also a great concern for human
health. Considering their reactivity and covalent protein binding po-
tentials with amino acid residues such as cysteine or methionine, the roles of BADGEs in mediating the activity of proteins may be very important. However, very little information is available for the protein targets of BADGEs. Future studies using chemical proteomics methods such as Activity-Based Protein Profiling (ABPP) and Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CESTA) can be considered to identify the global protein targets of BADGEs and their associated biological consequences.

Comparing with BPA and other common plastic additives, the toxicology information of BADGEs is still very limited. The endocrine disruptive effect of BADGE remains unknown, which could be one of the major focuses in the future. It is still not clear whether its PPARγ antagonistic effect is the main driver for its toxicological mechanism. A systematic approach (e.g., omics) should be employed to study its global impact on the biological pathways and compare the toxicity between them and other plastic additives with similar structures.

In summary, BADGEs are a group of compounds that are worthy to pay attention. Their potential health concerns are still not clear. More importantly, it can act as a classical model chemical to study the biological fate of reactive chemicals, further broadening our knowledge and filling the gaps on the analytical method, occurrence, transformation and toxicity of those “versatile” compounds.
