# Abstract

**Study Objectives:** Over 75% of US high school students obtain insufficient sleep, placing them at risk for adverse health outcomes. Identification of modifiable determinants of adolescent sleep is needed to inform prevention strategies, yet little is known about the influence of the built environment on adolescent sleep.

**Methods:** In this prospective study, actigraphy was used to assess sleep outcomes among 110 adolescents for 14 days each in eighth and ninth grades: duration (hours/night), onset and offset, and sleeping ≥8 hours. Home addresses were linked to built environment exposures: sound levels, tree canopy cover, street density, intersection density, population density, and housing density. Mixed-effects regression estimated associations of built environment measures with sleep outcomes, adjusting for sex, race, parent education, household income, household size, grade, weeknight status, and neighborhood poverty.

**Results:** A 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in neighborhood sound was associated with 16 minutes later sleep onset (β = 0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06, 0.49) and 25% lower odds of sleeping for ≥8 hours (odds ratio (OR) = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.96). A 1-SD increase in neighborhood tree canopy was associated with 18 minutes earlier sleep onset (β = −0.31, 95% CI: −0.49, −0.13) and 10 minutes earlier sleep offset (β= −0.17, 95% CI: −0.28, −0.05). No associations were observed for density-based exposures.

**Conclusions:** Higher neighborhood sound level was associated with lower odds of sufficient sleep, while higher tree canopy cover was associated with more favorable sleep timing. Neighborhood sound levels and tree canopy cover are potential targets for policies and interventions to support healthier sleep among adolescents.

## Statement of Significance
A longitudinal cohort study of 110 adolescents examined whether the residential built environment, including measures of noise, tree canopy cover, street connectivity, and population density, associated with sleep duration and timing, measured using actigraphy. We observed that increased neighborhood noise was associated with later sleep onset and reduced odds of ≥8 hours of sleep per night. We also found increased neighborhood tree canopy cover was associated with earlier sleep onset and earlier sleep offset. This means that the neighborhood built environment, particularly noise and green space, may be important targets for interventions to support healthier sleep among adolescents.

**Key words:** sleep; neighborhood; noise; built environment; children; adolescent ## Introduction
Insufficient sleep is associated with adverse health outcomes including obesity, unhealthy cardiometabolic profiles, depression, and anxiety. In the United States, over 53% of middle school and 75% of high school students do not meet national guidelines for a healthy sleep duration on school nights, increasing their risk for future chronic disease development. In addition, sleep timing metrics may be independent predictors of adverse outcomes in adolescence, including excess adiposity. Given the importance of sleep to adolescent health, the identification of modifiable determinants of adolescent sleep is a clinical and public health need.

The importance of neighborhood-level factors in sleep is increasingly recognized. Lower neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked with poor sleep outcomes among youth. However, the mechanisms linking lower SES and poor sleep remain uncertain. Residing in a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood may increase residents’ exposure to adverse built environment features that could impair sleep, such as excess noise and light. Lower SES neighborhoods may also lack access to green space, including tree canopy cover. Tree canopy cover has the potential to benefit sleep through protecting residents from light, noise, and excessive temperatures and has also been found to be associated with lower stress, better mental health, and greater psychological restoration.

Although it is plausible that the built environment may influence adolescent sleep health, this topic has not been extensively studied. Indeed, evidence regarding neighborhood effects on sleep largely stems from cross-sectional studies, self-reported sleep outcomes, and adult populations. Given the paucity of evidence regarding the relationship between the built environment and objectively measured adolescent sleep, we examined associations of the residential built environment with objectively measured sleep duration and timing during the middle-to-high school transition period. We hypothesized that adolescents residing in more densely populated and louder neighborhoods with less tree canopy cover would have shorter sleep duration and later timing of sleep onset and offset.

## Methods
### Participants
The Sleep and Growth Study is a longitudinal observational study that enrolled 118 adolescents in the eighth grade of middle school (2016–2018), with repeated assessments 1 year later (±1 month) when the adolescents had transitioned to the ninth grade of high school (2017–2019). Participants were recruited from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) network, which covers southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. Adolescents diagnosed with a medical or behavioral health condition that could affect their growth or sleep were excluded (e.g. cancers, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder). Parents/guardians provided written informed consent, and adolescents provided assent. The CHOP Institutional Review Board approved the protocol.

### Sleep outcomes
As described previously, we used the Actiwatch-2 (Philips Respironics) to objectively estimate sleep patterns in the home setting. The Actiwatch-2 was worn on the nondominant wrist for 14 days in eighth grade and for 14 days in ninth grade. After each 14-day wear period, the device was returned by mail, and Actiware (v.6.0.8) was used to automatically detect sleep and rest periods using the medium wake threshold. Manual adjustments to rest periods were considered when automatically generated start and/or end times were ±15 minutes different from the self-reported sleep diary. All manual edits were reviewed by a second reviewer, and any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. Sunday through Thursday nights were defined as school nights, and Friday and Saturday nights were defined as nonschool nights. Sleep duration was operationalized as hours per night and a binary variable for sufficient sleep was generated (≥8 or <8 hours). Sleep onset and offset timing were operationalized as hours from midnight (e.g. −1 = 11:00 pm).

### Built environment exposures
Participant home addresses were geocoded using ArcMap (v.10.5.1). To link built environment exposures, we defined each participants’ residential neighborhood as: (1) the census block group in which their home was located and (2) a half-mile buffer around their home address based on Euclidean (straight line) distances. These definitions were chosen because we expected built environment features that might influence sleep to operate at close proximity and to enable comparisons with prior studies among adults. In a sensitivity analysis, we also used a quarter-mile buffer around home addresses to measure built environment exposures in closer proximity to home addresses.

### Sound levels
Sound data were obtained from the US National Park Service Sound Map. The Park Service used random forest (decision tree-based machine learning algorithm) models to predict the expected sound levels across the contiguous United States on a typical summer day with calm conditions based on empirical acoustical data from 479 locations in national parks and urban and suburban areas. The model incorporated geospatial features including topography, climate, land cover, and anthropogenic (human made) sources and was validated using leave-one-out cross validation. Estimates were available at a resolution of 270 m. The specific sound metric used was L50 sound pressure level, which reflects the median sound level across all summer daytime seconds recorded for a given location after adjustment for the sensitivity of human hearing to very low and high frequencies (“A-weighting”). We calculated neighborhood-level sound levels by taking the average sound levels in A-weighted decibels (dBA) within a half-mile buffer of each participant’s residence.

### Tree canopy cover
Data on tree canopy cover were obtained from the 2016 National Land Cover Database. The Database was created by the US Forest Service and provides a raster file reflecting the estimated percent tree canopy coverage at a 30-m resolution for the continuous US. Estimates were produced using random forest regression models incorporating multi-spectral Landsat satellite imagery and elevation data. We calculated the average percent tree canopy cover within a half-mile buffer of each participant’s home.

## Street connectivity
Street connectivity was assessed by street density and intersection density using data obtained using Esri’s 2016 StreetMap Premium. Street and intersection density were calculated by dividing (1) the total linear meters of road in the half-mile buffer and (2) the total number of intersections in the buffer, by the buffer area in hectares.

## Density
Block group-level population density and housing density were calculated using the data from the 2012–2016 American Community Survey by dividing each participants’ census block group population and number of housing units, respectively, by its land area in square miles.

## Covariates
Participants self-reported their sex and race/ethnicity using the standard National Institutes of Health categories and the number of members in their household. The accompanying parent/guardian self-reported household income and education level. Based on data availability, we categorized participants as White, Black, and Other. The number living in the household was categorized as: ≤3, 4, 5, or ≥6. Parental household income was categorized as: <$40K, $40–69K, $70–99K, and >$99K. Parent/guardian education level was categorized as: some college or less, college degree, and graduate degree. Neighborhood poverty was assessed using the US Census Bureau’s 2012–2016 American Community Survey as the percent of residents in participants’ home census tract with household incomes below the federal poverty limit. Census data were retrieved from the IPUMS National Historical Geographic Information System.

## Statistical analyses
As in other studies, built environment variables were standardized to z-scores in order to facilitate comparisons across measures. Spearman correlations were calculated for the built environment variables for descriptive purposes. Separate mixed-effects models were used to test for associations between each built environment exposure and sleep outcomes. These models, which accounted for clustering of multiple days within participants (i.e. correlated, longitudinal data), adopted maximum likelihood estimation, random intercepts, robust standard errors, and an unstructured correlation matrix. We did not adjust for clustering by neighborhood because the vast majority of participants (85%) were the only participant in their block group and the number of block groups included in the study was relatively small. Linear mixed models were used for continuous outcomes, and logistic mixed models were used for the sufficient sleep outcome. Based on prior work using these data, sleep outcomes changed during the middle-to-high school transition and the changes were different for school and nonschool nights. We, therefore, included grade, school night status, and grade-by-school night interaction terms in model 1. Race and income were also included as covariates in model 1, as Black adolescents and adolescents from lower-income households were more likely to have missing data in ninth grade and lower adherence to the Actiwatch-2 protocol. In model 2, sex, parental education, and household size were added as covariates, and, in model 3, neighborhood poverty was added. Finally, differential associations between built environment exposures and sleep outcomes were tested by including grade and school night status interaction terms: built environment exposure-by-grade and built environment exposure-by-school night status. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine associations. All analyses were prespecified and completed using Stata 14.2 in 2020.

## Results
A total of 118 adolescents in eighth grade were enrolled. As illustrated in Figure 1, sleep data from 107 participants in eighth grade (1,362 nights; average number of wear days: 13.5 [SD = 2.1]) and 84 participants in ninth grade (1,047 nights; average number of wear days 13.1 [SD = 2.3]) were captured, totaling 2,388 nights from 110 adolescents. In eighth grade, 53% of the adolescents were female, 69% reported being White, 65% reported living in a household with an income ≥$99K per year, and 72% lived in suburban neighborhoods (Table 1). Parent/guardian education levels and the number of members living in the household varied (Table 1).

Means and SDs are provided in Table 1 for each built environment exposure, and additional descriptive statistics are provided in Supplemental Table 3 to provide more detailed information on the distribution of the built environment exposures. Positive correlations were observed between population, housing, street, and intersection densities. Spearman correlations also indicated that neighborhoods with higher population, housing, street, and intersection densities have less tree canopy cover and higher sound levels.

Neighborhood noise and sleep patterns
Higher neighborhood sound was associated with later timing of sleep onset adjusting for grade, school night status, race, and parental income. This association remained after additional adjustment for sex, parental education, number living in the household, and neighborhood poverty. Translated into minutes, a 1-SD higher neighborhood sound level was associated with sleep onset timing 16 minutes later per night on average in the fully adjusted model. In addition, higher neighborhood sound was associated with 25% lower odds of obtaining sufficient sleep. These associations remained consistent when using a quarter-mile buffer. The neighborhood noise associations with sleep outcomes were consistent on school and nonschool nights and in eighth and ninth grades, with the exception of sleep offset. A 1-SD higher neighborhood sound level was associated with later sleep offset in ninth grade only. Figure 2. Main associations between built environment exposures and sleep-related outcomes. Model 1 (dark navy blue circles): adjusted for race and household income. Model 2 (red squares): adjusted for race, household income, sex, parent education, and number living in household. Model 3 (green triangles): adjusted for race, household income, sex, parent education, number living in household, and neighborhood poverty rate. All models include school night status, visit, and a school night status × visit interaction as fixed effects. Estimates reflect the difference in sleep duration or timing (or relative odds of obtaining sufficient sleep) associated with a 1-SD increase in each built environment measure. All error bars are 95% CIs.

Neighborhood canopy cover and sleep patterns
Higher neighborhood tree canopy cover was associated with earlier timing of sleep onset adjusting for grade, school night status, race, and household income (Figure 2, model 1). This association remained with additional adjustment for sex, parental education, number living in the household, and neighborhood poverty (Figure 2, model 3: β = −0.31; 95% CI: −0.49, −0.13). The same direction of associations was observed between neighborhood tree canopy cover and timing of sleep offset (Figure 2, model 3: β = −0.17, 95% CI: −0.28, −0.05). Translated into minutes, a 1-SD increase in neighborhood canopy cover was associated with sleep onset that was on average 18 minutes earlier per night and with sleep offset on average 10 minutes earlier per morning. When using a quarter-mile buffer, these associations were in the same direction but attenuated with CIs crossing the null (Supplementary Figure 2).

The associations between neighborhood canopy cover with sleep onset and sleep offset were modified by weeknight night status (Supplementary Figure 3). A 1-SD higher neighborhood canopy cover was more strongly associated with earlier sleep onset on nonschool nights (β = −0.40 [24 minutes], 95% CI: −0.61, −0.20) compared with school nights (β = −0.26 [16 minutes], 95% CI: −0.44, −0.09). However, a 1-SD higher neighborhood canopy cover was associated with earlier sleep offset on nonschool nights (β = −0.33 [20 minutes], 95% CI: −0.51, −0.15), but not school nights (Figure 3). Furthermore, an association between higher neighborhood tree canopy cover and sleep duration was observed in eighth grade only (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 3). Specifically, a 1-SD higher neighborhood canopy cover was associated with longer sleep duration in eighth grade (β = 0.15 [9 minutes], 95% CI: 0.03, 0.27).

Neighborhood density-based measures and sleep patterns
We did not observe associations between density-based built environment exposures and any sleep outcome (Figure 2). However, street-density-by-grade and intersection-density-by-grade interactions were observed with respect to sleep offset (Supplementary Figure 3). In ninth grade, a 1-SD higher street density was associated with later sleep offset (β = 0.17 [10 minutes], 95% CI: 0.04, 0.31) (Figure 3); similarly, a 1-SD higher intersection density was associated with later sleep offset (β = 0.14 [8 minutes], 95% CI: 0.01, 0.27) (Figure 3). Figure 3. Neighborhood environment associations with sleep outcomes by weeknight status (gray-shaded backgrounds) and school grade level (white backgrounds). All models include weeknight status, visit, and a weeknight status × visit interaction, plus the following covariates: sex, race, parent education, household income, number living in household, and neighborhood poverty rate. Units on the x-axis are SDs for each built environment exposure, with a value of 0 indicating the mean level across the study population. All shaded areas are 95% CIs.

## Discussion
In a prospective cohort of adolescents, we examined the association of features of the built environment with objectively measured sleep duration and timing. Results suggest that greater exposure to neighborhood noise is related to later sleep onset and reduced likelihood of sleeping sufficiently. In contrast, greater neighborhood tree canopy cover was associated with earlier sleep timing, particularly on nonschool nights and with a longer sleep duration in eighth grade specifically. Our results provide evidence supporting the importance of several modifiable built environment exposures to adolescent sleep health.

Currently, the evidence on the role of environmental noise in adolescent sleep is limited by a lack of objective measurement of sleep outcomes. Several studies in European populations of children and adolescents have reported associations between environmental noise and more adverse parent-reported child sleep outcomes. Only one study measured sleep objectively in a subsample and did not find associations between noise and actigraphy-assessed sleep. Our finding that higher neighborhood noise was associated with reduced odds of obtaining sufficient sleep, assessed using actigraphy, provides additional support for the importance of environmental noise for adolescent sleep health. We also found higher neighborhood noise level to be associated with later objectively measured sleep timing, which is an important indicator of sleep health. Independent of sleep duration, later sleep timing among adolescents has been associated with adverse outcomes, including adiposity, substance use, emotional distress, and lower academic achievement. A prior study reporting results from a nationally representative cross-sectional sample of urban US adolescents indicated that environmental noise was associated with later self-reported sleep onset but not with shorter sleep duration. Additional research in other populations using objective estimates of sleep duration and timing are needed to verify our neighborhood noise findings.

We did not observe a main association between greater neighborhood tree canopy and objectively measured sleep duration among adolescents, but interaction analyses revealed that greater neighborhood tree canopy was associated with longer sleep duration in eighth grade only. In addition, we observed that greater neighborhood tree canopy cover was associated with earlier sleep timing in adolescents, and these associations were particularly strong on nonschool nights. Interestingly, these associations were detected using a half-mile buffer, but not a quarter-mile buffer, although results were in the same direction. This adds to a small body of evidence linking green space with better sleep outcomes among adults. | Findings | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Association with Green Space | Greater exposure to green space is associated with a lower risk of self-reported insufficient sleep. |
| Tree Canopy Cover | Greater tree canopy cover may help to shift adolescent sleep timing earlier without changing sleep duration. |
| Impact of Tree Canopy | Tree canopy cover may benefit sleep by protecting residents from light, noise, and excessive temperatures. |
| Circadian Rhythms | Tree canopy cover may regulate exposure to zeitgebers, aligning sleep timing with internal circadian clocks. |
| Neighborhood Density | No evidence found of an association between adolescent sleep and neighborhood density and street connectivity. |
| Interaction Analyses | Higher street and intersection densities were associated with later timing of sleep offset in ninth grade only. |
| Built Environment Features | Dense, walkable neighborhoods may expose residents to greater levels of noise, traffic, light, and air pollution, which may disrupt sleep. |
| Future Research Directions | Future work is needed to explore the pathways through which built environment features influence sleep in both adult and pediatric populations. |
| Observational Nature | The observational nature of the study limits causal assertions regarding the built environment's role in adolescent sleep health. |
| Experimental Research | Future experiments should test whether changes in the built environment improve adolescent sleep outcomes. |
| Strengths of the Study | Use of objectively measured sleep, unlike many studies relying on self-reported measures. |
| Limitations | Exposure measures based on home addresses, averaging from secondary datasets, and potential measurement errors in noise levels. |
| Conclusions | Higher neighborhood noise levels were associated with insufficient sleep, while higher tree canopy cover was linked to earlier sleep timing and longer sleep duration. The neighborhood built environment should be considered in interventions to support healthier sleep among adolescents. | Supplementary Material
