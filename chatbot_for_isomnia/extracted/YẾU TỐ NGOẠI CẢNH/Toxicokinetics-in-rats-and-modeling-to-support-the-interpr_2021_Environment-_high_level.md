# Title: Toxicokinetics in rats and modeling to support the interpretation of biomonitoring data for rare-earth elements

## Summary: This article presents research aimed at developing a biologically-based toxicokinetic model for four rare earth elements (REEs): cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, and yttrium. The model, constructed using both existing physiological data and new experimental kinetic data, reveals that REEs are rapidly cleared from blood and primarily accumulate in the liver, with excretion mainly occurring through feces. The study establishes biomonitoring equivalents (BEs) for praseodymium and neodymium, which can aid in interpreting biological measurements and assessing exposure levels in human populations. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the toxicokinetics of REEs and support risk assessments related to their environmental presence.
