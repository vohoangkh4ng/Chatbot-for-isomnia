Toxicokinetic models are useful tools to better understand the fate of contaminants in the human body and to establish biological guidance values to interpret biomonitoring data in human populations. This research aimed to develop a biologically-based toxicokinetic model for four rare earth elements (REEs), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd) and yttrium (Y), and to establish biomonitoring equivalents (BE) serving as biological guidance values. The model was constructed using physiological data taken from the literature as well as new experimental kinetic data. These new data indicated that REEs readily disappeared from blood and accumulated mostly in the liver; excretion occurred mainly through feces although a small fraction was eliminated in urine. To properly reproduce the observed kinetics, the model was represented as 19 compartments, which include main tissues and their components (such as retention by macrophages) supplied by blood, as well as routes of excretion. The transfer coefficients between compartments were determined numerically by adjustments to experimental data. Simulations gave good fits to available experimental kinetic data and confirmed that the same model structure is applicable to the four elements. BEs of 0.3 μg/L of Pr and Nd were derived from the provisional RfD of 0.5 mg/kg bw/day established by the U.S. EPA. These BEs can be updated according to new reference dose values (RfD). Overall, the model can contribute to a better understanding of the significance of biological measurements and to the inference of exposure levels; it can also be used for the modeling of other REEs. The BEs will further allow rapid screening of different populations using biological measurements in order to guide risk assessments.

1. Introduction

Rare-earth elements (REEs) are among the priority inorganic substances assessed under Phase 3 of the Chemicals Management Plan established by the Government of Canada. They are naturally occurring elements in mineral ores extracted during mining activities. In the past decades, there has been an increasing extraction and use of REEs in several sectors, including metallurgical and metal alloys, electronics and clean energy technologies. This has led to their release in the surrounding environment and transfer into the food chain.

While REEs have many novel applications, epidemiological studies are limited to date. However, there have been case reports of pneumoconiosis and interstitial lung disease in workers occupationally exposed to REEs. One of the rare epidemiological investigations further revealed that children living in REE-rich regions had lower intelligence quotients (IQ) and worse memory than those living in areas with normal REE levels.

Most toxicological data come from animal studies with a particular attention to oxidative stress and inflammatory response, while a few studies focused on neurotoxicity and developmental studies in addition to the classical body weight changes, serum biochemistry and tissue. M. Desrosiers et al.

histopathology. Recently, the U.S. EPA established a provisional subchronic and chronic reference dose (RfDs) for lanthanum of 5 mg La/kg bw. The U.S. EPA also derived a provisional subchronic reference dose (p-RfD) of 0.8 mg/kg bw for neodymium chloride (NdCl3) and praseodymium chloride (PrCl3). This is equal to a provisional RfD of 0.5 mg/kg bw for Pr and Nd (see Table 1 for the derivation of the RfD). More recently, in a 30-day oral toxicity study with soluble cerium chloride (CeCl3) in mice, a lowest-observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 10 mg/kg bw was observed, based on liver toxicity, as assessed by histopathological changes, fatty degeneration, and increased alanine aminotransferase.

To estimate absorbed doses of metals, measurements in accessible biological matrices have been conducted in the general population and in workers. For rare earth metals specifically, there is little data on biological levels in the general population. Some authors have studied the impact of living near mining areas on biological levels of REEs, through hair measurements, and have shown bioaccumulation of these elements related to distance from mining sites. There is a paucity of biomonitoring data for REEs using other biological matrices such as blood or urine to assess exposure and more specifically absorbed doses in groups of the population.

For a better assessment of the exposure-effect continuum and interpretation of biomonitoring results in the population, it becomes important to understand the fate of REEs in the body. Tissue distribution and retention of some REEs has been documented in rodents. The time courses of some REEs in blood and excreta have also been studied in rats after exposure to the chloride form, such as those of lanthanum (La) and of yttrium (Y) published in Japanese journals. However, the toxicokinetics of other REEs such as neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr) and cerium (Ce) are still poorly documented, and in particular the detailed time courses in accessible biological matrices, such as blood and urine.

While data from various studies contributed to our understanding of the biodisposition of REEs, integration of these data within a toxicokinetic model is needed. This project aimed to use biodisposition data from the literature and generate missing toxicokinetic data from laboratory animal experiments to develop a toxicokinetic model to be used by risk assessors to interpret biomonitoring data for these REEs. The biologically-based toxicokinetic modeling approach is similar to prior work. Modeling was conducted using a bottom-up approach based on experimental data and known mechanisms from the literature to specifically fit REE kinetic data. With the toxicokinetic model, it is possible to translate exposure doses associated with potential toxicity in rodents into human biomarker-equivalent metrics. The focus was put on four REEs (Pr, Ce, Nd and Y) in the chloride form, which were identified by Health Canada as lacking suitable toxicokinetic information.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Animals, care and acclimatization

The experiment was conducted in compliance with the OECD 417 guideline and animals were cared for in accordance with the Ethics principles of the Animal Care Committees of the University of Montreal and Health Canada. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing between 200 and 250 g) were purchased from Charles River Canada Inc. The temperature and humidity of the room were respectively kept at 22 ± 3 ◦C and between 40 and 70%. The lighting switched between a 12-h day/night cycle. During the 3-day acclimatization period as well as the whole study, rats had access to food (Teklad Global Diets® #2018 from Envigo, Canada) and water ad libitum. Twenty-four hours before exposure, rats were placed in their metabolic cage for the remaining duration of the experiment and they were given sweetened water, to induce an aqueous diuresis. Following treatment, food and water intake of rats were monitored along with their body weight and general behavior.

### 2.2. Dosing and sample collection

Rats were intravenously (IV) injected with 1 mg PrCl3, YCl3, NdCl3 or CeCl3/kg bw (n = 5 per dose and per REE). PrCl3, YCl3, NdCl3 and CeCl3 salts in powder form were dissolved in physiological saline (0.9%) for dosing. A volume of one mL was administered per kg of body weight. Another ten rats served as controls and were treated with the vehicle used to administer the REEs (that is an equivalent volume of physiological saline).

To determine levels of REEs excreted with time and allow to perform a mass-balance study, urine and feces were collected at fixed intervals for up to 7 days: 0–24 h prior to dosing and 0–3, 3–6, 6–9, 9–12, 12–24, 24–30, 30–48, 48–72, 72–96, 96–120, 120–144, 144–168 h after IV injection. The seven-day period was based on a prior pilot study showing that elimination from blood was very rapid with near complete.

elimination after 1 day and urinary excretion was almost complete after one week. Immediately after collection, urinary volumes were measured, and samples were frozen at 20◦C until analysis. Feces were also weighed prior to being frozen at 20 ◦C until analysis.

To follow blood levels of metals as a function of time, sequential withdrawals of blood were conducted (150–200 μL per time point) by the caudal vein (incision at the end of the tail) at times 20 h prior to dosing and at fixed time points during the 72-h period after IV injection: at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, and then 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 30, 48, 72 h postdosing. The time of blood sampling and blood volumes collected were revised with the veterinarian to respect the maximal volume of blood that can be withdrawn from a rat during the course of a week. On day 7 postdosing, rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed by cardiac puncture; main organs (liver, kidneys, spleen and lungs) were collected, washed with physiological saline (0.9%), weighted and then kept frozen at 80◦C until analysis.

## 2.3. Sample analysis

Sample preparation and digestion for elemental (Ce, Pr, Nd and Y) analysis by ICP-MS was performed in a cleanroom (ISO 2 standards 146442-1). This wet digestion method used was adapted from Pujalte et al. (2017) and is described elsewhere (Jomaa et al., 2021). Elemental analysis was conducted with an Agilent ICP-MS 7700x (Agilent, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) in a cleanroom (ISO 3 standards 146442-1). Quantification method is also described elsewhere (Jomaa et al., 2021). The limit of detection was in the order of 0.05 ppb, which is equivalent to 0.05 ng/g of tissue/feces or 0.5 ng/mL of urine.

## 2.4. Experimental data analysis

The time courses of Ce, Pr, Nd and Y elements in blood were expressed as a percent of administered molar dose. The time courses of Ce, Pr, Nd and Y elements in urine and feces were expressed as a cumulative percent of administered molar dose. Levels of REEs in liver, kidneys, lungs and spleen on day 7 postdosing were expressed as concentrations (μg/g) and percent of administered molar dose.

Several toxicokinetic parameters can be derived from a non-compartmental analysis of the time courses of the REEs in blood. The analysis was carried out considering a bi-exponential elimination time-course. The rate constants for each of the two elimination phases were determined by least-square fit adjustments to observed individual blood concentration–time profiles of each REE by using “curve fitting” tool in MATLAB (MathWorks) and apparent half-life (t1/2) values were calculated. The area under the concentration-curve (AUC), the area under the first moment of the concentration-curve (AUMC), the mean residence time (MRT), the apparent blood clearance (Clblood) and the apparent volume of distribution (Vss) were also calculated from the individual time course of the REEs. The volume of blood (Vblood) of each rat was estimated for each sample of blood based on its weight (mrat) with Eq. (1). An average blood volume per rat (kv) of 60 mL/kg bw was used.

Vblood = mratkv                                                                         (1)

## 2.5. Model development

A multi-compartment dynamical model was developed to describe the biodisposition kinetics of Ce, Pr, Nd and Y elements. The model is depicted in Fig. 1 and symbols and abbreviations used in the functional representation of the model are described in Table 2. The model seeks to predict the essential biological features of the kinetics of these REEs. Blood, key organs or tissues, urine and feces were each represented by a compartment. Arrows stand for the transfer rates of the REEs from one compartment to another; compartment interconnection is represented by the systemic circulation where tissue blood represents a fraction of cardiac output. The variations with time in compartment burdens were described mathematically by a system of differential equations where the rate of change in a compartment burden is the difference between its input and output rates. Evaluating numerically the system of differential equations with MATLAB (R2020a) yields the time courses of the element in the different compartments.

The model representation was based on the new data collected by our team on the time-courses of Ce, Pr, Nd and Y elements in blood, urine, feces after IV injection in rats together with tissue levels (liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs) at the time of sacrifice 7 days postdosing. Other data from the literature were used to define. Table 2

accumulation in certain tissues (Bingham and Dobrota, 1994; Damment and Pennick, 2007; Hirano et al., 1993; Molina et al., 2014; Nakamura et al., 1997) (see Supplementary file S1.1 for details of model representation).
In our model, some tissues had to be subcompartmentalized to account for the transfer from tissue blood to the cellular matrix with fast exchange rate and tissue retention components; this is the case for the liver, spleen, kidneys and lungs. The sum of amounts modeled in these tissue subcompartments was used to compare to the contents observed in those organs at the end of the experiment. The liver was split into subcompartments representing parenchymal (hepatocyte) and non-parenchymal cells. Biliary secretion is represented by the link between the hepatocyte compartment and the GIT compartment. The GIT was also considered to receive a negligible fraction of soluble REE cleared from the lungs through the mucociliary escalator (Molina et al., 2014). It was further necessary to consider a transmembrane transfer of the REE from blood to the intestinal lumen (intestinal secretion), a phenomenon also observed for other elements (Carrier et al., 2001). As for the liver tissue, the lungs were both split into cellular tissue matrix with fast exchange (pulmonary cells) and a retention compartment (macrophages) to allow modeling both the rapid turnover and accumulation observed in Hirano et al. (1993). Similarly, the kidneys were split up in two compartments to accommodate for the excretion in urine from cellular tissue matrix with fast exchange as well as the retention in the tissue. The spleen included a retention compartment represented by macrophages.

2.6. Determination of parameter values
The transfer rates between compartments were either determined by extracting information from the literature or by fitting them using the data from the experiment presented in this study. The literature was used to determine the appropriate fraction of the cardiac output to the organs. Parameters from the literature were also used for known mechanisms that did not have a significant impact on the time-courses and thus did not need to be fitted. Otherwise, adjusted parameters were determined by fits to the experimental data gathered in our study using the sequential steps presented in Table 3 (see also Supplementary file S1.2 for the detailed estimation of parameter values).

2.7. Sensitivity analysis
Once the parameters of the model were fitted, they were varied individually to assess their impact on the blood time-curves and cumulative urinary and fecal excretion. MATLAB (R2020a) was used to compute the changes. The impact of each parameter was calculated with Eq. (2). The normalized sensitivity coefficient indicates the impact of a change in the parameter value. A high sensitivity coefficient (close to 1) indicates that a change in the parameters has a large impact on a specified section of the model (i.e. cumulative excretion in urine and feces or blood concentration at different time points).

Normalized sensitivity = % change in target / % change in parameter value

The parameter values were varied by 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 and the modified time-courses were graphed against the original curves obtained with default parameter values (see Supplementary file S1.3 for more details).

2.8. Determination of biomonitoring equivalents
The model serves to relate absorbed doses and urinary levels. Firstly, a daily absorbed dose of 1 unit was used as input in the model until steady state equilibrium was reached and corresponding urinary fraction in 24-h collections was determined and reported. Secondly, a human biomonitoring equivalent (BE) was also determined based on links between a point-of-departure dose established from a key toxicity study and urinary

The U.S. EPA has established a provisional p-RfD from an oral NOAEL dose derived from a subchronic animal study to which an uncertainty factor of 1000 was applied (see Table 1). The model was used to simulate an oral repeated daily exposure to this animal NOAEL dose until steady state was reached and corresponding 24-h urinary level postexposure was obtained. An oral absorption fraction of 0.0005 was used for this simulation. A human BE expressed in terms of daily amounts was then established by applying the 1000-fold uncertainty factor to the predicted rat urinary excretion levels. The human BE expressed as daily amounts was converted into concentrations by considering a 70 kg body weight, an average daily urinary volume of 1.5 L and the following Eq. (3).

### 3. Results

#### 3.1. Experimental study in rats

Fig. 2 on the time courses of Ce, Pr, Nd and Y in blood following intravenous injection of the four metals in chloride form showed that peak values observed at the first sampling time point, hence at 5 min post-dosing, represented 52–70% of injected dose depending on the animals. For all REEs, an initial rapid elimination from blood was observed followed by a slower elimination phase.

The AUC, AUMC, MRT, Clblood and Vss were also in the same range for all four metals. The Vss of all four metals shows substantial tissue distribution. Mean values ranged between 120 and 206 mL for the different REEs.

Fig. 3 shows the cumulative excretion of Ce, Pr, Nd and Y in feces as a function of time (expressed as a molar percent of dose) over the 7-day period following intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg bw of the four metals as chlorides in rats. Fecal profiles were similar for all four metals. It is also clearly evident that most of the excretion of the REEs is through feces and that excretion was not complete 7 days postdosing, given that asymptotic values were not reached at that time point. The mean (±SD) percentages of injected dose recovered in feces as Ce, Pr, Nd and Y were calculated to be 27 ± 5, 22 ± 7, 22 ± 4 and 48 ± 15%, respectively, during the 0–7-day period (0–168 h) postdosing. Y had the highest excretion of the 4 metals but also the largest variation even after subtracting background excretion observed prior to injection (background excretion only observed for Y).

Fig. 4 depicts the cumulative excretion of Ce, Pr, Nd and Y in urine as a function of time (expressed as a percent of dose) over the 7-day period following intravenous injection of the metals as chlorides. Levels of REEs detected in urine were significantly lower than in feces. Mean (±SD) percentages of injected dose recovered in urine as Pr, Ce, Nd and Y.

With the parameter values presented in Table 6, Figs. 2–4 show that model simulations provided good fits to the available experimental time course data. Figs. 5 and 6 report normalized sensitivity coefficients obtained when varying parameter values. Almost all of the parameters had somewhat an impact on the predicted time courses, but variations in the time courses are not explained by a shift in a single parameter value. However, sensitivity analysis showed that the liver transfer rates from

4. Discussion

4.1. Novel kinetic data in rats

This is the first study to document the kinetic time courses in rats intravenously exposed to the naturally occurring stable isotopes of 140Ce, 141Pr, 146Nd and Y (89Y) administered separately but within the same experimental framework. Some authors had documented the in vivo kinetic profiles of stable isotope of Y (89Y) after intravenous and oral exposure to the hydrated salt form in animals, but most studies were published in Japanese and had to be translated. Those studies were used in the present work for comparison purpose. The other in vivo kinetic studies in animals published in the literature for these metal elements were on synthetic and radioactive isotopes of cerium (141Ce and 144Ce) and on a radioisotope of yttrium (91Y). The kinetic time courses of the four assessed REEs were similar in the exposure conditions retained in our study. The kinetics were also similar to that obtained by Damment and Pennick on a lighter REE, lanthanum (La). The intravenous data of the current study showed that all four studied REEs were rapidly cleared from blood and the calculated volume of distribution (Vss) indicates substantial tissue distribution. Furthermore, the blood clearance rate and the Vss were similar for all four REEs. Results also show that the liver was a major accumulation organ and significant levels remained in this tissue 7 days post-dosing. The spleen, kidney and lungs showed much lower values. The intravenous data also showed that the REEs were excreted primarily in feces. Excretion was not complete 7 days post-dosing, in line with the substantial amounts remaining in the body and in particular in liver at this time point. Urinary excretion values were very low (on average 0.3–2.4% depending on the REEs) and the time courses were similar for all four metals, although Y appeared to be excreted in slightly higher amounts in urine compared to the other three studied REEs over the 0–168 h period post-dosing. The rapid elimination of the REEs in the ionic form from the blood and uptake by hepatocytes can be partly explained by transferrin-mediated transport. Results of the present work are in line with the available Japanese data by Nakamura et al. on the toxicokinetics of hydrated yttrium chloride (YCl3⋅6H2O) following intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg bw in male Wistar rats. Similar to our results, Nakamura et al. reported that Y was cleared from blood within 4 h post-dosing. The mean (±SD) percent of dose recovered in feces as Y over the 7-day period post-injection of YCl3⋅6H2O was 5.4 ± 0.5%. No elements were detected in urine. Highest tissue levels of Y were found in the liver, reaching 81% of the injected dose at 8 h post-dosing; on day 45, up to 38.3% of the injected dose remained in the liver. Nakamura et al. also reported that highest concentrations of Y were found in the liver followed by the spleen, femur and then kidneys on day 8 following injection. In line with our results, the mean percent (±SD) of dose recovered in liver, spleen, bones and kidneys as Y at that time point was 54.7 ± 5.6%, 16.3 ± 4.3%, 9.6 ± 1.8% and 0.36 ± 0.04%, respectively. Furthermore, Nakamura et al. reported a mean elimination half-life of 0.43 h in whole blood of male Wistar rats after intravenous injection of 10 mg YCl3 6H2O/kg bw and of 19.4 days in liver. Our results are further in line with those of Hirano et al. on the tissue distribution and elimination of Y after a single intravenous injection of YCl3⋅6H2O in male Wistar rats dosed with 1 mg/rat as well as 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 2 mg/rat. As observed in our study, blood levels of Y decreased rapidly within 3 h following injection. The liver was a main accumulation tissue; about 75% of the dose was found in the liver at 7 h post-dosing. Clearance of Y from the liver was reported to be slow, with a monoexponential decrease from the 7 h to 144 days, for which an apparent elimination half-life of 144 days, on average, was calculated at the dose of 1 mg YCl3⋅6HO/rat.

## A biologically-based toxicokinetic model for the studied REEs

The experimental data acquired allowed the estimation of basic parameters for the development of a toxicokinetic model of REEs. The model developed focuses on the kinetics of absorbed REEs in the soluble form. The general structure of the model is biologically based (physiological compartments, tissue volumes and fraction of cardiac output to tissues taken from the literature); REE specific parameters or those not available in the literature were obtained by adjustments to novel experimental time course data in rats. The subdivision of tissue components into subcompartments was based on physiological considerations and known mechanisms. Good fits to experimental data were obtained only when introducing a kidney retention compartment, and liver and GI tract subcompartments to account for the delay in urinary and fecal excretion. The addition of a renal retention compartment is compatible with the observations by Kitamura et al. that REEs form colloidal conjugates in blood, leading to accumulation of these compounds in the reticuloendothelial system and glomeruli. The fact that fecal excretion was not complete after 7 days is also in line with the data of Hirano et al., which showed that Y in blood was found in the colloidal material, which then accumulates in liver and spleen phagocytic cells, contributing to a slow elimination phase in feces.

Furthermore, to keep the fraction of the dose to the different tissues accurate, the compartments of the model and several transfer rates had to be calibrated on the basis of observed data. For example, the hepatocyte subcompartment of the liver had to accumulate a large portion of the dose directly after injection. The structure of the model could not allow the amounts of REEs accumulated in the liver and eventually excreted in feces to be apportioned substantially to any other compartment. As such, the model transfer rate from the hepatocyte subcompartment to the GIT can be compared to other studies more directly.

In the same manner, the non-parenchymal subcompartment transfer rate to blood can be compared to studies where higher doses may lead to longer half-lives in the liver. The transfer rates to these liver subcompartments and out of these subcompartments had to be adjusted so that the subcompartments uptake and release rates of REEs allowed matching with the fecal time course. The base structure of the model can be easily adjusted with additional information; the bone compartment is already included with its fraction of the cardiac output, but any other organ can be added as a compartment with an adequately constructed set of parameters and their respective cardiac output.

The model can be modified to simulate exposure by different routes, provided that more kinetic data on exposure to the soluble REE forms by the oral or respiratory routes are made available. To date, the kinetics of stable REEs following exposure by routes other than intravenous injection are poorly documented. In one of the only studies on the kinetics of soluble forms of REEs after oral exposure, Nakamura et al. showed negligible oral absorption of the REEs in rats. In their study, male Wistar rats were dosed orally with 100 and 1000 mg/kg of DyCl3⋅6H2O, EuCl3⋅6H2O, YbCl3⋅6H2O and YCl3⋅6H2O (n = 3–4 rats per group); urine and feces were collected at times 0–1, 1–4 and 4–7 days post-dosing and liver, kidneys, spleen and femora levels were measured. For all four REEs, virtually all the contents were recovered in feces. Specifically for Y, the mean (±SD) percent of dose recovered in feces over the 7-day period post administration was 96.9 ± 1.31% for the 100 mg/kg dose and 93.9 ± 3.52% for the 1000 mg/kg dose (n = 3). None of the REEs were detected in urine and tissues, at both doses. Other early studies on the biokinetics of REEs administered orally focused mainly on radioactive rather than stable isotopes, but gave insights into the biological behavior of these compounds. In particular, these studies revealed that oral REE absorption is very limited, as oral absorption fractions in the 0.0001–0.0005 range were reported. This approximated oral absorption value can be used to infer on the kinetics of the REEs following oral exposure.

The model could also be modified to simulate inhalation exposure. The model would then apply to the fraction reaching systemic circulation and would require a full evaluation with kinetic data following inhalation exposure. To date, such data for the studied REEs are limited, but according to available data, a significant proportion of the dose is retained at the site of entry. Published inhalation studies focused mainly on particle (nano and micro) forms of stable cerium or of the radioactive isotope. In particular, the kinetics of radio-cerium (144Ce) following deposition of relatively soluble forms of cerium (chloride and citrate) in the respiratory tract of rats, dogs, monkeys and hamsters are available and are detailed. It was shown that there is little absorption of 144Ce from the upper respiratory tract, although the absorption characteristics depend strongly on the methods of preparation and administration of the material. Based on the rare data on stable soluble forms of REEs after exposure by the respiratory route, it was also shown that REEs were slowly cleared from the lungs. Hirano et al. studied the time course and dose-related changes in distribution of Y between lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) following rat intratracheal instillation of yttrium chloride. Pulmonary clearance of Y was very slow and the half-life was estimated to be 168 days. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis suggested that Y was localized in lysosomes of alveolar and interstitial macrophages, as well as basement membranes, explaining the long pulmonary half-life of Y after respiratory exposure.

The model only applies to the soluble form of REEs. Differences in the kinetics of REEs have been reported depending on the form of the compound (soluble or insoluble). Molina et al. compared the bioavailability, tissue distribution, clearance and excretion of radioactive 141Ce after intratracheal instillation, gavage, or intravenous injection of 141CeO2 NPs and 141CeCl3 (ionic CeCl3 and 141CeO2 NPs were predominantly retained in the same organs, i.e. the liver, bone and spleen, sequential analyses of lungs over 28 days after intratracheal installation showed slower lung clearance of 141CeO2 NPs (half-life ≈ 140 days) compared to the ionic 141Ce (half-life ≈ 55 days).

On the other hand, following gavage of all forms (5 mg/kg), nearly 100% of both test materials were excreted in feces. The toxicokinetic model further considers first order kinetics, thus implying the absence of saturation, and main data-derived parameters were estimated from a single dose. Future studies are needed to establish the range of application of the model. The study of Hayashi et al. is among the very few studies where multiple doses of REEs were administered to rats. These authors documented the urinary excretion of stable YCl3⋅6H2O in 24-h urine collections of male Wistar rats given high oral doses of 14.6, 29.2, 58.3 and 116.7 mg/rat of YCl3 (n = 5 per group). The average percent of dose recovered in urine was 0.216%, with a good dose-dependent urinary excretion (r = 0.77). However, significant decreases in urinary volume (>30%) and creatinine (>10%) were reported at YCl3 doses of 58.3–116.7 mg per rat. The authors concluded that high Y dosage alters glomerular function rather than the proximal convoluted tubules. Other processes such as protein binding in blood are saturable, such that they might become relatively more important at high doses, i.e. increase in the uptake by the Kupffer cells or other types of cells. High carrier levels are also linked to the formation of agglomerates of proteins which bind REEs. However, such shift in the kinetics at high dose is not likely to be observed under environmental conditions. Table 8

Finally, one of the limits of the presented data-based model is that it was developed mainly using the new kinetic time course data generated in the current work. Internal validity of the model was verified by reproducing the observed kinetics of four different REEs conducted using the same experimental framework. Partial biodisposition data are also available in the literature and our model simulations show good fits to these data (Table 8). However, to fully validate the model, complete independent sets of kinetic data would be needed.

4.3. Determination of biomonitoring equivalents for the studied REEs with the toxicokinetic model

Finally, although the model is based on animal data, it could also be extrapolated to humans as was done with other toxicokinetic models. This would allow to reduce uncertainty factors when extrapolating to humans. However, our model can still be directly used to determine biomonitoring equivalents corresponding to point-of-departure doses of REEs established from toxicity dose–response studies in animals by deriving urinary levels corresponding to critical doses (NOAEL, LOAEL or BMD) and applying default uncertainty factors for extrapolation to humans. New biomonitoring equivalent values can be directly proposed once exposure limits or guidance values become available. The BEs will further allow rapid screening of the population using biological measurements in order to guide risk assessments.

5. Conclusion

Overall, this study provided new data on the kinetic time courses of ionic Ce, Pr, Nd and Y administered intravenously as chloride salts. Direct comparison of these four REEs showed similarities between their kinetics. The studied REEs were readily cleared from blood and accumulated mostly in the liver. REE excretion occurred mainly through feces, although there was also a small fraction eliminated through the urinary route. Excretion was not complete 7 days postexposure, in line with the substantial amounts remaining in the body, particularly in the liver. These data served to build a robust biologically-based
