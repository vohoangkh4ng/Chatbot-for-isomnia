Effects of single and combined gestational phthalate exposure on blood pressure, blood glucose and gestational weight gain: A longitudinal analysis

A B S T R A C T

Few studies have investigated the association of gestational exposure to phthalate with metabolic risk and have reached inconsistent conclusions. Based on the Ma’anshan Birth Cohort, 3273 women were included in the present study. All participants provided up to three urine samples for 7 phthalate metabolite measurements. The hazard index (HI) was used to evaluate the cumulative risk of multiple phthalate coexposures. The outcomes of interest included hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDOP), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and gestational weight gain (GWG). The incidences of HDOP, GDM, and excessive GWG were 5.93%, 13.09%, and 28.95%, respectively. Exposure to a single phthalate metabolite or a specific diester during the first trimester of pregnancy elevated blood pressure (BP) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the third trimester and body weight gain throughout pregnancy. However, inverse relationships were revealed for some phthalate metabolites, which were inconsistent with the results of their diesters. The HI value during the first trimester was positively associated with subsequent BP, FPG, and GWG. In addition, HI during the first trimester increased the risks of GDM [odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 1.02–1.75)] and excessive GWG (OR = 1.76, 95% CIs = 1.41–2.19) in a linear manner thereafter. Notably, phthalates might directly increase maternal blood glucose and pressure, and these changes were secondary effects of the obesiogenic effects of certain phthalates. In conclusion, exposure to single and multiple phthalates during the first trimester of pregnancy increased the risks of maternal metabolic syndrome components. However, the conflicting findings between phthalates and their metabolites need to be interpreted carefully.

1. Introduction

Phthalates are a family of synthetic plasticizers that are widely used in daily life, and human exposure is ubiquitous. Pregnancy is a window of susceptibility, and many phthalate metabolites are detectable in urine samples of pregnant women. Epidemiological studies have observed that phthalate exposure during pregnancy is related to the prevalence of pregnancy complications. A systematic literature search performed in 3 online databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure) recently demonstrated that there are currently 6, 7, and 2 studies that investigated the association of gestational exposure to phthalates with blood pressure (BP), blood glucose, and gestational weight gain (GWG), respectively. Specifically, 5 out of 6 studies regarding BP indicated that exposure to some phthalate metabolites during pregnancy was associated with increased BP and risks of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

In contrast, only one cross-sectional study revealed that mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) and mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP) were linked to BP reduction. In addition, relationships between phthalate exposure and blood glucose during pregnancy were inconsistently reported; some were not significantly different from null, some were positive, and others were inverse. Even in the same study, the directions of relation with different metabolites were conflicting. This phenomenon was similarly observed in the association of phthalates with the risk of impaired glucose intolerance and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Two studies suggested that gestational exposure to phthalates was negatively related to GWG. Furthermore, some of these studies ignored the combined effect of multiple phthalate metabolite co-exposures and might underestimate the true cumulative risk, as they cause similar adverse health effects due to similar structures.

It is well known that the occurrence of complicated maternal disorders identifies women at high risk of developing future vascular disease. Systematic reviews of cohort studies have demonstrated that GDM raises the risks of type 2 diabetes and preeclampsia 7- and 1.8-fold, respectively. In addition, preeclampsia elevates the 3.4-fold risk of hypertension. These pregnancy complications further increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases as well as morbidity and mortality and even exhibit adverse impacts on obesity and metabolism in offspring. Therefore, the evidence for GDM and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDOP) as vascular risk indicators is compelling. The 2011 American Heart Association guidelines on cardiovascular disease in women included GDM and HDOP in their vascular risk assessment. During pregnancy, excessive maternal weight gain increases the risk of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and GDM. Moreover, the presence of maternal obesity and GDM has a significant impact on a higher frequency of HDOP. Obviously, these risk factors for metabolic syndrome are also clustered in childbearing women. Therefore, metabolic syndrome can be diagnosed during pregnancy. It is of great significance to explore the common risk factors for the components of metabolic syndrome.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of single and

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Study subjects and sample collection

The present study was based on the Ma’anshan Birth Cohort (MABC) study from Anhui Province, China. Briefly, 3474 pregnant women were enrolled at the first visit (Visit 1: 10.45 ± 2.13 weeks of gestation) and followed during the second (Visit 2: 26.00 ± 1.01 weeks of gestation) and third trimesters (Visit 3: 34.38 ± 1.07 weeks of gestation). The follow-up continued at delivery (Visit 4), 42 days postnatal (Visit 5) and 3 months postnatal (Visit 6). Before delivery, urine and serum samples were provided at each visit. This process is illustrated in Fig. 1. Only 3273 (94.2%) women gave a singleton live birth. Of these, 105 (3.2%), 334 (10.2%) and 2830 (86.6%) women provided one, two and three urine samples, respectively. Four women did not provide any urine to analyze phthalate exposure. Therefore, 3269 women were finally included in the present study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics and Research Committees of Anhui Medical University (No. 20131195). Written informed consent was obtained from participants before their enrollment in this cohort study. Creatinine adjustment was used to correct for urine dilution.

### 2.2. Outcome assessment

The estimated exposure of a single phthalate diester was calculated using the equation:

Diester(μg/kg body weight/day) = (μg/g ∑ UC) × CE(g/day) × MWp(g/mol) / (FUE × weight(kg) × MWm(g/mol))

where UC was the creatinine-adjusted concentration of a phthalate metabolite. CE was calculated using the following equation: CE(g/day) = 0.993 × 1.64 × (140 age) × (weight^1.5 × height^0.5). MWp and MWm were the molar masses of a single phthalate diester and the corresponding metabolite, respectively. FUE is the fraction of phthalate diesters excreted in urine. The data for these parameters are shown in Table S1. For instance, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) = 6.2% × weight × 390.56 + 10.9% × weight × 390.56 + 14.9% × weight × 390.56.

The hazard index (HI) was used to evaluate the cumulative risk of multiple phthalates, including dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP), and DEHP. HI was calculated as follows: HI = ∑ Diester / TDI. The TDIs (the European Food Safety Authority tolerable daily intake) of DBP, BBzP, and DEHP were 10, 500, and 50 μg/kg/day, respectively. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were not included in the HI calculation because of unavailable TDI data from the European Food Safety Authority.

### 2.4. Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software 16.0, Stata 13.0 and GraphPad Prism 5.0. We calculated the arithmetic average value for the first two or the three visits to better approximate the average phthalate exposure across early pregnancy or the whole pregnancy, respectively. Concentrations of phthalate metabolites, phthalate diesters and HI values were log-10 transformed for normality. For longitudinal analyses, a linear regression model was used for continuous variables (e.g., FPG, systolic and diastolic BP, and weight gain), and a logistic regression model was conducted for categorical variables (e.g., GDM, HDOP, and GWG). For associations of phthalate exposure with repeated measurements of FPG and systolic and diastolic BPs, linear mixed models with random effects were performed. Mediation analyses used the PROCESS macro for SPSS 22.0 with a 5000-bias-corrected bootstrap sample for significance testing. Stratified analyses were performed based on the prepregnancy BMI. Potential nonlinear relations between phthalate exposure and the risks of GDM, HDOP, and excessive GWG were investigated using ### Results

A total of 194 (5.95%) women developed HDOP, and 428 (13.09%) women had GDM. The average systolic and diastolic BPs and FPGs at Visits 1–3 are shown in Table S2. The mean GWG was 17.83 kg, while 28.95% of women gained excessive weight (Table S2). All detection rates for the phthalate metabolites were higher than 98.72%, except for MBzP at 49.14%. The median concentrations of MMP, MEP, MBP, MBzP, MEHP, MEOHP and MEHHP were 22.69, 7.51, 60.82, 0.06, 4.88, 9.48 and 7.95 μg/g creatinine, respectively. The concentrations of phthalate metabolites at each visit are shown in Fig. S1. The exposure estimations of 5 phthalate diesters are shown in Table 2. The most heavily exposed phthalate diesters were DEHP and DBP. The average HI values at Visits 1–3 were 0.18, 0.28, and 0.37, respectively.

#### Association between phthalate exposure and BP, blood glucose and GWG
The results regarding the association between phthalate exposure and BP, blood glucose and GWG are shown in the Supplementary Material, Table S3 and Table 3. High exposure to HI, DMP, DEP, DBP and their metabolites at the first visit was linked to high levels of FPG-3rd, systolic BP-3rd, total weight gain, and risk of excessive GWG. Although MEHP and MEOHP exposure showed some inverse associations, MEHHP and DEHP exposure were positively associated with total weight gain and risk of excessive GWG. For the average exposure level before visit 2, DBP and HI were positively associated with FPG-3rd, systolic and diastolic BP-3rd, weight gain in late pregnancy and risk of excessive GWG. The majority of phthalates and their metabolites and HI were positively related to the risk of excessive GWG. During the entire pregnancy, the average exposure to all phthalates and their metabolites and HI elevated the risk of excessive GWG, although some of the findings were not statistically significant. However, these results of phthalate metabolites in later trimesters of pregnancy appreciably changed. The results of the relationships of phthalate exposure with repeated measurements of FPG and systolic and diastolic BPs are shown in Supplementary Material, Table S4. During the first trimester, MBP, DBP and HI increased systolic BP, but MMP and MEHP exposures were inversely associated with diastolic BP. Most phthalate metabolites during early pregnancy or the entire pregnancy were negatively associated with FPG and systolic BP.

#### Mediation of maternal weight gain in the relationship of HI with blood glucose and pressure
Table S5 (Supplementary Material) shows the results of the mediation analyses, which were performed only for those HI values that were significantly associated with blood glucose and BP. The association between HI at the 1st visit and FPG-2nd, FPG-3rd, systolic and diastolic BP-2nd and FPG-3rd were partially (range: 6.00–19.45%) mediated by total weight gain. In addition, these analyses showed that 8.36%, 27.27% and 9.09% of the associations between average HI before the 2nd visit and maternal weight gain were significant. Table 2

Note: The sample size was less than the number of urine samples because some maternal weight and/or height data were unavailable for the phthalate diester exposure calculation.

FPG-3rd, systolic and diastolic BP-3rd were mediated by maternal weight gain in late pregnancy, respectively. However, most of the direct effects were also statistically significant.

3.5. Sensitivity analyses results

When we analyzed prepregnancy BMI separately, the above-mentioned effect estimates were consistent in the underweight and normal weight populations. However, some significant associations disappeared in the overweight/obese population. During the first trimester, HI-1st was positively associated with most of the outcomes of interest. HI-1st was associated with higher FPG-2nd and FPG-3rd and systolic BP-3rd in the overweight/obese population. The average HI value at the 1st and 2nd visits was negatively associated with systolic BP-3rd and weight gain in late pregnancy in the normal weight population. For the entire pregnancy, the average HI was associated with weight gain after the 3rd visit in both the underweight and normal weight populations. HI at each visit was positively associated with the risk of excessive GWG in the underweight population.

3.6. Nonlinear relationship of HI value with the risks of GDM, HDOP, and categorical GWG

Fig. 4 displays the estimated curves of the associations between log10-transformed HI and the outcomes of interest. The risks of GDM, HDOP and excessive GWG increased with log10-transformed HI-1st in a linear manner. Of note, the relationship between log10-transformed HI-3rd and the risk of GDM was nonlinear.

4. Discussion

This study suggested that the incidences of HDOP, GDM, and excessive GWG were 5.93%, 13.09%, and 28.95%, respectively. For phthalate metabolite exposure, MBP exposure was highest, followed by MMP, MEOHP and MEHHP. Consistently, the results of phthalate diester exposure revealed that DBP and DEHP exposure were highest. Pregnant women were cumulatively exposed to multiple phthalates. Both the models of phthalate metabolites and diesters showed that most phthalate exposure in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, was associated with increased blood glucose and pressure and maternal weight gain in pregnancy. Single and combined exposure to phthalates in early pregnancy significantly increased the levels of blood glucose and maternal weight gain.

maternal weight gain during pregnancy in the relationship of HI with blood glucose and pressure in the present study were performed. These findings indicated that most of the direct effects of HI on blood glucose and pressure and their indirect effects mediated by maternal weight gain simultaneously existed. Both of these phthalates were directly responsible for the BP and glucose changes, and those changes were secondary effects of the obesiogenic effects of certain phthalates. However, accurate reasons for the conflicting results between phthalates and their metabolites are unclear. On the one hand, the main phthalate metabolites showing negative relationships with FPG and BPs during early pregnancy were MEHP and MEOHP, two metabolites of DEHP. Therefore, we hypothesized that the opposite results between DEHP and MEHP and MEOHP were partly attributed to the different effects of the three DEHP metabolites. MEHHP, another metabolite of DEHP, was positively associated with FPG. On the other hand, although LMM took the influence on model parameter fitting into consideration when the repeated variables were not independent of each other, the cross-sectional relationships (e.g., the association between HI-1st and FPG-1st) were not completely controlled in LMM in the present study. Therefore, using other statistical models, longitudinal relations were mainly performed between phthalate exposure and outcomes of interest in this study. However, these hypotheses would be further researched. There were some limitations that should be considered. First, differences in the phthalate exposure and demographic characteristics of participants may limit the generalizability of our findings. Participants across all racial/ethnic/territory groups are exposed to different levels of phthalate metabolites. In addition, our previous study found that maternal age, education, parity, passive smoking during pregnancy, sunscreen product application and season of urine collection influenced the concentrations of phthalate Total Weight gain

metabolites. Second, urinary creatinine, rather than specific gravity (SG), was used for the urinary dilution adjustment because we did not detect urinary SG. We believe it would not change our results, as some studies have reported a strong correlation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.83) between the two indices. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) to measure the concentration of phthalate metabolites, both the SG and the creatinine-standardized phthalates in pregnant women were highly correlated with the excretion rate, and the correlation coefficients for both techniques were very similar. In addition, to determine the relationship between different phthalate metabolites analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS and oxidative stress (indicator: isoprostane), performed regression models adjusting for creatinine or SG, and the results from the two models did not change appreciably. Third, a limitation of the study is the potential exposure misclassification when phthalate exposure was studied independently during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters, although up to three urine samples were provided for the entire gestation.

Conclusion

Gestational exposure to single and multiple phthalates is associated with later maternal BP, blood glucose, weight gain and risks of GDM and excessive GWG. Specifically, the first trimester of pregnancy seems to be an important period during which phthalates increase the risk of pregnancy complications. We cannot compare the risks associated with a single versus multiple phthalates because the units of phthalate metabolite (μg/g creatinine), phthalate diester (μg/kg/day) and HI (no unit) are different. However, according to the method of Wu et al., we calculated the percentage change in outcomes for a doubling concentration incremental increase of the exposure variable concentration as (10(lg2×β) 1) × 100%, where β was the regression coefficient. We observed that the risks of blood glucose | Log transformed HI value | P-value |

Fig. 4. Restricted cubic spline models for the relationships of hazard index (HI) value with the risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDOP), and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG). [For the GDM model, maternal age, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), income and primiparity were adjusted; for the HDOP model, prepregnancy BMI was adjusted; for the GWG model, prepregnancy BMI and education were adjusted. The red line shows that the odds ratio was equal to 1; solid line and dashed lines, respectively, represent the associations and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of HI with GDM, HDOP and GWG; a p-value for the Chi-square test of <0.05 shows that the relationship line is a curve, and otherwise, it is linear.]

and pressure and weight gain associated with HI-1st were 1.08–1.74-fold higher than those associated with a single phthalate diester-1st. Furthermore, phthalates could directly increase maternal blood glucose and pressure, and these changes are secondary effects of the obesogenic effects of certain phthalates. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (IFGO) has identified environmental exposures, especially in the first trimester, as related to pregnancy complications as being foundational to prevent noncommunicable maternal diseases in the forthcoming year. Our findings are consistent with this IFGO opinion identifying first trimester exposure as a window of opportunity to potentially prevent multiple pregnancy complications.
