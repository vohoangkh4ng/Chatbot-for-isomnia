# Title: Exposure estimates of phthalates and DINCH from foods and personal care products in comparison with biomonitoring data in 24-hour urine from the Norwegian EuroMix biomonitoring study

## Summary: This article investigates the exposure levels of phthalates and DINCH derived from food and personal care products, utilizing data from the Norwegian EuroMix biomonitoring study. It highlights the pathways of human exposure to phthalates, which are commonly used as plasticizers and can lead to reproductive and developmental toxicity. The study combines concentration data from literature with consumption and usage frequency data to perform probabilistic exposure assessments. The findings indicate that the highest contributions to phthalate exposure come from beverages, dairy, bread, and meat products, with measured urinary levels correlating with estimated exposures. Overall, the estimated exposures were found to be lower than the tolerable daily intake values set by health authorities, although upper bound estimates approached these limits.
