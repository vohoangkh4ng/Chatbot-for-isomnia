# Title: Variations of antibiotic resistome in swine wastewater during full-scale anaerobic digestion treatment

## Summary: This article investigates the effectiveness of three types of anaerobic digesters in removing antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from swine wastewater. The study reveals that removal efficiencies varied significantly among the digesters, with the up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and high-density polyethylene covered biogas digester (HDPE-BD) performing better than the buried biogas digester (BBD). Despite these efficiencies, pathogens were not effectively removed, raising concerns about the potential health risks associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in livestock waste. The findings suggest that HDPE-BD is the most effective option for mitigating antibiotic resistance in swine wastewater.
