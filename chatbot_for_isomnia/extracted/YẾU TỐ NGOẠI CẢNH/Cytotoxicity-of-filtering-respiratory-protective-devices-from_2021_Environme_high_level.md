# Title: Cytotoxicity of filtering respiratory protective devices from the waste sorting industry: A comparative study between interior layer and exhalation valve

## Summary: This article investigates the cytotoxicity of microbial contamination found in filtering respiratory protective devices (FRPD) used in the Portuguese waste-sorting industry. The study compares the cytotoxic effects of contamination from the interior layer and exhalation valves of FRPD on human lung cells and swine kidney cells. Results indicate that while both components exhibit cytotoxicity, the interior layer shows a higher cytotoxic effect compared to the exhalation valves. The findings highlight the potential health risks associated with inhalation exposure to contaminants in the waste-sorting environment.
