Continuous exposure to low doses of persistent organic pollutant (POPs), such as those occurring in the general population, might contribute to the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, evidences from longitudinal studies are scarce. We aimed to explore the associations of accumulated POP exposure with the development of T2DM by means of 1) longitudinal associations with the 16-year incidence of the disease, and 2) complementary cross-sectional analyses with markers of glucose homeostasis at recruitment. Organochlorine pesticide and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were analyzed in adipose tissue samples and incident T2DM cases were retrieved from clinical records. Homeostatic model assessment values of insulin sensitivity/resistance and β-cell function at recruitment were calculated. Linear and Cox-regression models were performed. In individuals with normal weight/overweight (n = 293), we observed positive dose–response relationships between the studied POPs and T2DM risk, particularly for hexachlorobenzene (HCB) [hazard ratio (HR): 3.96 for 4th quartile versus 1st quartile (Q1); confidence interval (CI) 95%: 0.79, 19.71]. PCB-180 showed a positive but seemingly non-linear association with T2DM risk [HR of 3er quartile (Q3) versus Q1: 6.48; CI 95%: 0.82, 51.29]. Unadjustment for body mass index considerably increased the magnitude of the associations. In the cross-sectional study (n = 180), HCB and PCB-180 were inversely associated with insulin sensitivity and positively associated with insulin resistance parameters. Our results suggest that a higher burden of specific POPs in adipose tissue may disrupt glucose homeostasis, possibly contributing to increase T2DM risk, especially in non-obese adults.

## 1. Introduction

According to the International Diabetes Federation, around 463 million adults in the world were affected by diabetes in 2019 (with future projections of a 51% increase by 2045), of which type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounted for 90% of the diagnoses. The differences in prevalence of T2DM between regions cannot be fully explained by well-established risk factors such as population ageing, obesity trends, dietary patterns or lifestyles. Thereby, it has been suggested that external environmental factors, including exposure to some persistent organic pollutants (POPs), could contribute to the burden of T2DM. R.

POPs are a heterogeneous group of lipophilic chemicals with a high resistance to chemical degradation. These properties induce a high potential of bioaccumulation in living organisms, particularly in fatty tissues, and biomagnification up the food chain. Long-term POP exposure, even at low doses, is suspected to cause a number of negative effects in human health and the environment. POPs include a variety of chemicals, such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. Although strict legal restrictions have been implemented over the last decades on their production and use, their ubiquity, persistence and the residual use in certain countries have maintained their relevance in public health. Long-term POP exposure in the general population occurs mainly through diet, although other routes such as air inhalation and skin contact also contribute to internal levels.

Previous review articles and meta-analyses support the associations of OCP and PCB concentrations with T2DM. Despite this, there are still several knowledge gaps: 1) the causal link between POPs and T2DM remains unclear, partly because of the cross-sectional design of most previous studies; 2) the existing longitudinal studies have mainly focused on the association between POPs and T2DM through accidental or occupational exposures, which are not applicable to the general population; and 3) recent studies have suggested a non-linear dose–response association between PCBs and OCPs with T2DM, which lead to a statistical challenge for modelling the associations with U shape or inverted U. Moreover, previous longitudinal studies have used plasma or serum to measure the exposure of selected POPs. Up to our knowledge, no longitudinal study with this aim has used adipose tissue as a source of POP exposure, which indeed is considered the most adequate matrix for assessing long-term exposure to mixtures of these lipophilic compounds.

Obesity is an important risk factor for T2DM development and progression, as well as for a greater bioaccumulation of POPs due to increased adipose tissue. However, the role of obesity in influencing the relationship between levels of specific POPs and T2DM remains unclear. Current bibliography remains controversial, suggesting a potential modification effect with no clear direction, since it might probably vary among different populations. Taking into account the growing obesity prevalence in virtually all countries, the study of this variable in the analysis of POPs-T2DM associations warrants further research.

The present work is framed within previous efforts to assess the metabolic disrupting potential of chronic exposure to environmental contaminants in GraMo adult cohort. In fact, previous prospective research in the cohort have evidenced an increase in hypertension risk and metabolic syndrome components in relation to the exposure to OCPs and PCBs. Thereby, the objective of this study was to assess the potential contribution of long-term exposure to a selection of POPs on the development of T2DM by combining two approaches: 1) a longitudinal analysis exploring associations with the 16-year T2DM incidence, and 2) a cross-sectional analysis focused on the associations with markers of insulin sensitivity/resistance and beta-cell function at recruitment.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Study design and population

The present study population was a subsample of the GraMo cohort, extensively described elsewhere. Briefly, patients undergoing non-cancer-related surgery (41% hernias, 21% gallbladder diseases, 12% varicose veins and 26% other conditions) were recruited from July 2003 to June 2004 in two public hospitals in the province of Granada (San Cecilio University Hospital in Granada city and Santa Ana Hospital in Motril), both located in the south of Spain. Inclusion criteria were: age over 16 years, absence of cancer, absence of hormone therapy at recruitment, and at least 10-year residence in the hospitals reference area. Of the 409 subjects who were invited, 387 (94.6%) accepted to participate. For the present study, we excluded 15 participants with T2DM diagnosis at recruitment. After the follow-up performed in September-October 2019, the longitudinal analysis was conducted in 372 participants who provided adipose tissue and had no T2DM at recruitment. The cross-sectional analysis was performed in a subcohort of 226 individuals who provided blood in addition to adipose tissue samples. There was no loss of participants over the follow-up since no patient moved from the original place of residence.

All participants included in the study signed an informed consent and ethical approval was given by the Ethics Committee of Granada.

### 2.2. POP analyses

Samples of 5–10 g of adipose tissue were intra-operatively collected and immediately coded and stored at -80 °C until chemical analysis. Sample preparation and purification was based on an adaptation of solid–liquid extraction procedure, and chemical analyses were performed by means of Gas-Chromatography coupled Mass Spectrometry.

![Participant’s flowchart](Fig. 1) in tandem mode. More details on the specific parameters used in GraMo cohort have been described elsewhere. The limit of detection (LOD) was set at 0.01 μg/L for all POPs under study. Chromatographic concentrations below the limit of detection were assigned a random value between 0 and the LOD. Residues of the following OCPs were quantified: p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE, the main metabolite of the pesticide dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dicofol, α- and β-hexachlorocyclohexane (α- and β-HCH, respectively), and the PCB congeners 138, 153 and 180. POPs were a priori selected on the basis of the reported high prevalence in human populations as well as their suspected health implications. POP recovery from adipose tissue samples was studied to assess the extraction efficiency of the method and ranged from 90 to 98%. Lipid content in adipose tissue samples was quantified gravimetrically as reported by Rivas et al. Normalized POP concentrations were expressed in nanograms per gram of lipid (ng/g lipid).

### 2.5. Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses of POP concentrations included medians, 25th and 75th percentiles. Percentages over LOD were used to the description of dicofol and α-HCH due to their low detection frequency of samples above the LOD. The magnitude of associations between POP concentrations and the 16-year diabetes incidence was evaluated by estimating Cox-regression models with time-to-events as the time variable, calculating hazard ratios (HRs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Estimations of time-to-events were based on the dates of recruitment, diagnosis, and end of follow-up (15-October-2019). Data on deceased participants over follow-up (18%) or on those reaching the end of follow-up without the event of interest were censored and only their disease-free time was considered in the analyses. A test for the proportional hazard assumption was performed with satisfactory results as part of the diagnostics of the models, using the cox.zph function implemented in the R survival package. This function correlates the scaled Schoenfeld residuals with the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function.

The functional form of the associations (i.e. linearity) was evaluated using generalized additive models (GAM) with gamlss package. POP concentrations were log-transformed in order to reduce the skewness of the distributions. Concentrations were also categorized in quartiles, considering quartile 1 (Q1) as the reference category.

In our study, the following scenarios were considered in the conceptual framework of the hypothetical associations between POPs and markers of glucose homeostasis and T2DM:

1) BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, sex and age are variables that meet the criteria of potential confounding factors in the association between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). BMI could be also an intermediate variable in that association.

### 2.4. Diabetes and covariate assessment
Between September and October 2019, data from new cases of diabetes were retrieved from the DIRAYA clinical records and the medical prescriptions databases. DIRAYA, developed in 1997 and implemented in 2003, was designed to facilitate clinical procedures and to assist clinical and epidemiological research. The system integrates all clinical information for each user of the regional public health system, who receives a unique ID code, including primary and specialized care, with data on all diagnostic tests performed and pharmacological treatments received. With this updated revision including additional health databases, we refined T2DM diagnosis of those previously classified as diabetic based on self-reported information and/or point fasting glucose levels in routine laboratory tests. A participant was considered as prevalent (at recruitment) or incident type-2 diabetic when: 1) T2DM diagnosis had been registered in his/her DIRAYA records, and/or 2) regular prescription of antidiabetics had been registered in the prescriptions database. Inconsistencies between the two. Table 1

Significant interactions were found between BMI and β-HCH (p-value = 0.02), PCB-153 (p-value = 0.04) and HCB (p-value = 0.03); for p,p’,p-DDE and PCB-180 the p-value of interaction was 0.07 and for PCB-138 was 0.17. All interaction terms showed the same direction, so that the effect of the studied POPs decreased at higher BMI levels (data not shown). Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding the obese population (≥30 kg/m²). Despite the lack of statistical significance at a 95% level, probably due to the limited sample size, we observed suggestive positive dose–response associations of p,p’,p-DDE, HCB, PCB-138, and PCB-153 with T2DM risk in those individuals with normal weight or overweight (n = 293), which were particularly strong in the case of HCB (HR: 3.96 for Q4 versus Q1; CI 95%: 0.79, 19.71) found when entering the variables in quartiles.

Considering that BMI might also be in the causal pathway between selected POPs and T2DM development, and in order to avoid model overfitting, we repeated the Cox-regression models without adjustment for this variable. The direction of the associations did not substantially change in comparison to the fully-adjusted models presented in Table 3, but the magnitude of associations was substantially higher

versus glucose homeostasis markers, HCB and PCB-180 were inversely associated with insulin sensitivity parameters. These associations were particularly strong for HOMA-IS (CP) parameters, and maintained a similar shape than those observed in the longitudinal analysis with incidence of T2DM. HCB and PCB-180 were also positively associated with insulin resistance. In general, HCB and PCB-180 showed inverted U-shape-like relationships with beta cell function parameters. These trends in the different parameters were similar for the rest of POPs analysed.

4. Discussion

Our results suggested that accumulated exposure to certain POPs might contribute to the development of a sustained subclinical reduction in insulin sensitivity that may contribute to an increased T2DM risk in the long-term, and that obesity could be a modifier in the causal association. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study analyzing the association between adipose tissue PCB and OCP concentrations and the risk of T2DM, confirming our previous cross-sectional findings. It is noteworthy that the mixed longitudinal and complementary cross-sectional approach in the present study reinforces causality of the associations and minimizes potential reverse causality issues.

POPs have been linked to disturbances in the homeostatic balance of adipose tissue leading to inflammatory and oxidative effects. This local inflammatory scenario alters the role of adipose tissue in glucose homeostasis and induces the release of free fatty acids, adipokines and inflammatory proteins to systemic circulation, reaching peripheral tissues and promoting an early subclinical metabolic damage that might be evident in the long-term. In addition, the chronification of the POP-induced low-grade inflammation could disrupt the normal metabolic function of cells responsible for insulin action. Although our HOMA results should be carefully interpreted because of the cross-sectional design, they suggest a potential POP-induced peripheral insulin resistance for the pollutants analyzed here. Conversely, Clair et al. reported an inverse association between serum POP exposure and insulin resistance in a cross-sectional study. Several factors might account for these paradoxical findings, including the different biological matrices used to estimate the exposure and the relatively increased POP exposure levels of the referred cohort. Interestingly, a recent review article provided evidence supporting that exposure to POPs increases the risk of developing insulin resistance. Thus, and taking into account that data from HOMA could reflect more the insulin secretion than pancreatic beta cell “health”, the observed positive associations between lower levels of HCB and PCB-180 and beta-cell function parameters may be interpreted as an insulin overproduction compensatory mechanism at the beginning of the damage, which might eventually reach a certain plateau at higher POP concentrations. These subclinical effects, if prolonged in time, might Table 4

Strengths of the present study include the use of adipose tissue for exposure characterization, which is considered the most adequate estimator of long-term exposure to POPs. In addition, the combination of a cross-sectional analysis focused on early markers as glucose homeostasis, with a longitudinal approach based on a long follow-up of clinical events reinforces the causality of the associations investigated shedding light on potential mechanisms of action. Regarding HOMA values, the use of two measures (C-peptide and insulin) to determine beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity, can help to reduce bias.

This study also has potential limitations to take into account in the interpretation of findings: i) our results may have been compromised by the relatively small sample size and lack of statistical power to detect significant associations. Nevertheless, sample size was enough to detect trends that might be reproduced in larger populations; ii) although we have analyzed potential confounders, we cannot rule out the influence of third uncontrolled variables, such as physical exercise and/or changes in covariates during follow-up. We cannot either ignore the possible | HCB | PCB-180 |

interference from other unmeasured co-exposures to other contaminants in the observed associations; iii) the hospital-based setting of this study could limit the generalization of results to the general population. However, the incidence of T2DM found in our study is similar to that recently described in a nation-wide population based cohort from Spain with 7.5 years of follow-up; iv) BMI was derived from self-reported weight and height, that could have led to certain non-differential misclassification bias, which might move the estimates towards the null; v) we did not stratify obese subjects according to metabolic health status; vi) the analyzed pollutants might correlate among them but also with other unmeasured exposures. The ascertainment of individual and global effects represents an important challenge for current environmental epidemiology, and a priority for further analysis in the GraMo cohort. In conclusion, our results evidenced that historical exposure to specific OCPs and PCBs might be a risk factor for insulin resistance and T2DM, particularly HCB and PCB-180, and that obesity is a potential effect modifier in the associations found. Despite the numerous studies carried out so far on this issue, the complexity of this relationship still needs to be further confirmed in future studies. Declaration of Competing Interest
