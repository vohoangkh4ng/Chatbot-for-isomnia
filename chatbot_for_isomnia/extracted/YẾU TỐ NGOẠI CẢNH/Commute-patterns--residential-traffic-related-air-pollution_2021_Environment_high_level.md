# Title: Commute patterns, residential traffic-related air pollution, and lung cancer risk in the prospective UK Biobank cohort study

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between commuting patterns, residential nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, and lung cancer risk using data from the UK Biobank cohort study. The study analyzed 234,124 employed participants and identified 493 lung cancer cases over an average follow-up of seven years. Results indicated that frequent use of public transportation was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer compared to regular automobile use, particularly in areas with high NO2 levels. The findings suggest a need for further research into the specific components of public transportation that may contribute to this elevated risk.
