# Title: Breast cancer risk in relation to ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter: results of a population-based case-control study corrected for potential selection bias (the CECILE study)

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between air pollution and breast cancer risk, focusing on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). A population-based case-control study was conducted involving 1,229 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 1,316 control women. The study found that exposure to NO2 was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly for hormone-receptor positive tumors, while no significant association was observed for PM10 or PM2.5. The findings suggest that traffic-related air pollutants may contribute to breast cancer risk.
