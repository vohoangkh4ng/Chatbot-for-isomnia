# Title: Association of multi-metals exposure with intelligence quotient score of children: A prospective cohort study

## Summary: This article investigates the impact of co-exposure to multiple heavy metals, specifically lead, manganese, antimony, tin, and titanium, on the intelligence quotient (IQ) scores of children aged 7 to 10 years in Hunan Province, China. The study employs both linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression models to analyze the data collected from 633 participants. Findings indicate that higher levels of urinary lead and titanium are associated with lower IQ scores, and the overall negative effects of multi-metal exposure on children's IQ are significant. The research highlights the need for further attention to the interactions between different metal exposures and their cumulative effects on cognitive development in children.
