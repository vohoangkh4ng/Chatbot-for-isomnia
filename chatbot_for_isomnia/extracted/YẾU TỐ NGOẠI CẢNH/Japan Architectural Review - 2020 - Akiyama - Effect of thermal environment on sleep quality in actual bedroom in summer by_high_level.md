# Title: Effect of thermal environment on sleep quality in actual bedroom in summer by sleep stages analysis

## Summary: This article presents a field survey conducted in actual bedrooms during summer, utilizing polysomnography to assess how the thermal environment affects sleep quality. The study analyzes signals from electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, and electromyogram to determine the impact of factors such as air temperature, air velocity, and air turbulence on sleep stages. Findings indicate that the influence of the thermal environment varies with the sleep cycle, with air turbulence negatively affecting sleep quality at low or neutral temperatures, while having negligible effects at warmer temperatures. The research highlights the importance of maintaining an appropriate thermal environment to enhance sleep quality, particularly in the context of rising outdoor temperatures and increasing sleep disturbances.
