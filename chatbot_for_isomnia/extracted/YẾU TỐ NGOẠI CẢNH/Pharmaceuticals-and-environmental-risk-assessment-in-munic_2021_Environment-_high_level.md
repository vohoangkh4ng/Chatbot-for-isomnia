# Title: Pharmaceuticals and environmental risk assessment in municipal wastewater treatment plants and rivers from Peru

## Summary: This study investigates the removal of pharmaceutical substances in municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) in Peru and their impact on surface waters. It analyzes samples from various MWWTPs and surface water, identifying 38 target pharmaceuticals. The findings reveal that a significant percentage of these compounds remain in treated wastewater, with acetaminophen being the most prevalent. The study assesses the environmental risk posed by these pharmaceuticals, indicating that certain antibiotics and acetaminophen present a high ecological risk in both treated wastewater and surface waters. The results suggest that current treatment processes are insufficient, highlighting the need for improved methods to mitigate environmental risks associated with pharmaceutical contamination.
