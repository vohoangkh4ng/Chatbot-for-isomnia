### Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing concern worldwide. Exposure to xenoestrogens (XEs), such as phthalates, parabens, and phenols, lead to CKD. However, kidney function and its complex relationship with XEs, lifestyle, and dietary habits are not well understood.

### Methods
In the present cross-sectional community-based cohort study, we enrolled 887 subjects for a questionnaire-based interview and laboratory tests. XE exposure concerning lifestyle/dietary habits were evaluated using questionnaires. Urinary levels of 17 XE metabolites were measured in 60 subjects with high exposure risk scores and 60 subjects with low exposure risk scores.

### Results
Univariate and multivariate linear regression showed that a high exposure score (β ± SE: 4.226 ± 1.830, P = 0.021) was independently negatively associated with eGFR in 887 subjects. Univariate and multivariate linear regression to urinary XEs and urine albumin creatinine excretion ratio (UACR) in 120 subjects indicated that ethylparaben (EP) (β: 1.934, 95% CI: 0.135–3.733, P = 0.035) was significantly associated with increased UACR. Multivariate regression analyses of the CKD subgroup (n = 38), after adjusting for age, showed that higher levels of mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), EP, nonylphenol (NP), and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) were significantly associated with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Higher urinary levels of MEHP (OR: 3.037, 95% CI: 1.274–7.241) were more likely associated with high exposure scores (>5 points), after adjusting for diabetes, gender, eGFR, age, Na, Ca, albumin, vitamin D, systolic blood pressure (SBP), white blood cell count, total bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, and heart rate. MEHP (β ± SE: 0.033 ± 0.009, P < 0.001) was also significantly positively associated with total exposure scores after applying multivariate linear regression analyses.

### Conclusion
XE exposure scores obtained from the questionnaires were negatively associated with kidney function. Urinary metabolites of XEs, including EP, NP, BP-3, and MEHP, are potential risk factors for micro-albuminuria and decline in kidney function. MEHP seemed to have the strongest correlation with high exposure scores and decline in kidney function.

## 1. Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a globally prevalent disease resulting in grave healthcare burden, and is associated with various infectious, metabolic, and cardiovascular comorbidities. In recent decades, numerous risk factors of CKD have been identified, including diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking, age, gender, genetic inheritance, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, and use of analgesic medications. The connections between CKD, environmental pollutants and industrial byproducts have attracted attention in recent years, including heavy metals from soil or water, second-hand smoke, herbicides, pesticides, air pollution and xenoestrogens (XEs). Xenoestrogens (XEs) means chemicals can mimic the activity of endogenous estrogens by binding to membrane-anchored estrogen receptors and transactivating a series of downstream signaling pathway. XE would antagonize their interaction with estrogen receptors or disrupt the synthesis, metabolism and functions of endogenous female hormones. XEs are also called environmental estrogens that can be divided into two categories: naturally produced or synthesized. There are many sources of XEs, including phytoestrogens from vegetables and fruit, heavy metals (Co, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb), alkiphenols from dental instruments, food or blood containers (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), pesticides (dichlor-diphenyl-trichlorethylane, endosulfane) and cosmetics (parabens). However, most of these synthesized XEs may have harmful effects because they could interfere with endocrine processes; therefore, they are also classified as endocrine disruptors.

Phthalates, described a class of chemicals that are dialkyl or alkyl aryl esters of 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, are ubiquitously used plasticizers, which are mainly applied to PVC to enhance its plasticity, flexibility, and durability. The phthalate diester is cleaved into the respective hydrolytic monoester, then the alkyl chain of the resulting hydrolytic monoester can be altered by various oxidation reactions, finally, the oxidized secondary metabolites would be conjugated with glucuronic acid and eventually excreted in urine. The long chain phthalates, such as DEHP and di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DiNP), are primarily used in PVC. However, they are not chemically bound to PVC, and thus, migrate into the environment with time and use, becoming universal environmental contaminants. Short-chain phthalates, such as dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP), are commonly applied in non-PVC use, for instance, personal-care products, cosmetics, enteric-coated tablets or adhesives. There is a growing concern about the effect of exposure to phthalates on human health, and the biological effects of this cumulative exposure due to certain intensive medical treatment are particularly troubling in infants due to their inherent sensitivity. Adverse health effects, such as pre-natal exposure associated shortened anogenital distance in baby boys which may linked to infertility in adult men, post-natal exposure associated premature thelarche, eczema, and asthma in young girls, endometriosis, adenomyosis, and leiomyoma in women, and impaired reproductive function and decreased semen quality in men were reported. In February 2015, DEHP was banned from general use under Europe union law in what was seen by many as a positive move for health and the environment, furthermore, in January 2019, Europe union expanding the number of restricted phthalates to four, including DEHP, dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) and diisobutyl phthalates (DiBP), because they are more toxic among phthalates.

Emerging evidence from human studies indicates that phthalate plasticizers may also increase the risks of malignancy, metabolic syndrome, kidney injury, autism spectrum disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Several studies have indicated that the daily phthalate plasticizer intake of the Taiwanese population is significantly higher than that of other countries. In an animal study, maternal exposure to DEHP disturbed kidney development in the offspring through the renin-angiotensin system, and DEHP wounds resulted in glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and podocyte effacement in adults. The actual molecular mechanisms for phthalate-associated kidney injury still need to be clarified. In current evidence, DEHP would induce renal tubular cell morphology change, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induction and fibrotic signals, which may be the mechanisms of exacerbating CKD progression. A public health crisis involving phthalate-tainted foods occurred in Taiwan in 2011, when DEHP was deliberately added to food mainly consumed by elementary students. The affected children were assessed by an estimated phthalate-intake questionnaire immediately, as well as urine microalbumin, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and β2-microglobulin tests post questionnaire survey one to two years of follow-up. It was revealed that DEHP from phthalate-tainted foods were likely to be a risk factor for increased microalbuminuria, a biomarker of kidney injury. Exposure to environmental pollutants, including triclosan, DEHP, cadmium, lead, and mercury, were significantly positively related to urinary β2-microglobulin, a biomarker of kidney injury, which was found in a cross-sectional study in Korea. A study in China also yielded similar results, wherein DEHP and benzyl butyl phthalate were found to be associated with hyperlabuminuria, hyper-NAGuria, hyperβ2-microglobulinuira which implied impaired kidney function. Therefore, phthalates may result in kidney injury.

To date, there are only a few studies exploring kidney function relationship between three kinds of XEs, i.e., phthalates, parabens, and phenols, in combination with lifestyle and dietary habits. Here, we conducted a cross-sectional, community-based cohort study in four districts of northeastern Taiwan. A community outreach health screening, including physical examination, blood and urine laboratory tests, a questionnaire-based survey, and urine tests for XE metabolites, was performed to recruit the subjects. The main aim of this study was to analyze XE exposure in the general population, and to estimate the adverse impacts of XEs on kidney function.

## Materials and methods

### Study population

The cross-sectional study was based on data from a community health activity staged by the Chang Gung Community Research Center in the Wanli, Ruifang, Gongliao, and Anle districts in northern Taiwan between September 2017 and December 2019. The community health activity outreach screening comprised of routine health examinations (physical examinations, blood tests, and urine analyses) and a questionnaire-based survey of health behavior for all community participants. The activity was staged annually, as well as all the examinations. The aim was to detect and treat any potential health problems early, and enhance health. In 2019, we added an additional questionnaire survey about XE and urine XE test. People (aged 18 to 80) who attended the health activity and agreed to perform the XE analysis were enrolled. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. A standardized questionnaire was provided to all participants by a team of trained interviewers, seeking information on their occupation, education, place of residence, drinking, smoking, betel nut chewing habits, exercise regimes, medication history (oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin injections, statins, herbs, and hormones), family history, life habit about XE exposure risk, and physical and mental health status (Short Form health survey, sleep quality survey, depression survey, and health knowledge). A total of 887 people were enrolled for the blood and urine tests and questionnaire-based interviews. Each person’s questionnaire scores for XE exposure was summed up. Then, a total of 120 people were chosen for further estimation of XE metabolites in urine; the group was composed of 60 people randomly selected from the low exposure group (questionnaire scores ≤ 5 points) and 60 people randomly selected from the high exposure group (questionnaire scores > 5 points). Data for the CKD subgroup (CKD being defined as either the presence of proteinuria or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 in two separate appointments, classified into stages 1 to 5 according to the NKF/DOQI classification) was extracted for further analyses. This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institutional Review Board at Chang Gung Memorial. ## 2.2. Questionnaires on XE exposure risk

Seven questionnaires concerning XE exposure were designed. Ten interviewers were trained to gather detailed information from the subjects about their intake of potentially XE-tainted foods and lifestyle habits. The question items were listed as follows:
1. Do you often use plastic bags for hot food?
2. Do you often use plastic tableware?
3. Do you often eat packaged processed foods?
4. Will you use plastic wrap for microwave, steaming or packaging oily food in your home?
5. How many days do you drink a beverage in a commercially available plastic cup?
6. Do you use perfumed bathroom products?
7. Do you use plastic floor mats in your home?

Each question was scored from 0 to 3 based on the frequency, as follows: 0 points, if the frequency was less than one day per week; 1 point, if the weekly frequency was between 1 and 2 days; 2 points, if the weekly frequency was between 3 and 4 days; and 3 points, if the weekly frequency was between 5 and 7 days.

## 2.3. Sample collection: Serum and urine

Blood samples were collected from the participants after overnight fasting, and were delivered immediately (within 4 h of collection) to the laboratory for biochemical analyses, complete blood count, and antibody titers. A fraction of the samples was transferred to chilled tubes and centrifuged at 3000g for 10 min at 4 ◦C to obtain the serum. Lipemic or hemolyzed serum was discarded. Other serum samples were aliquoted and stored at -80 ◦C until further analyses. First morning urine was collected using the midstream clean catch method.

## 2.4. Urinary XE metabolite measurement

Urine was tested for the presence of XE metabolites, including phthalates, parabens, and phenols. The following XEs or metabolites of XEs were estimated:
1. Phthalate metabolites: monomethyl phthalate (MMP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-(n-butyl) phthalate (MnBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and mono-iso-nonyl phthalate (MiNP);
2. Parabens: methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP), propylparaben (PP), and butylparaben (BP);
3. Phenols: bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-di-t-BP), triclosan, triclocarban;
4. Others: benzophenone-3 (BP-3) (Table 8).

The sample pretreatment process was modified based on a previous study. Before analysis, urine samples were thawed at 4 ◦C for 24 h. Urine sample (100 μL) was added to 20 μL of methanol (MeOH) containing five Stable isotope labeled internal standards including 13C12-BPA, 13C6-4-t-OP, 13C4-MiNP, 13C4-MEHP and D7-PP, 5 μL of β-glucuronidase (85000 U/mL), and 20 μL of 1 M ammonium acetate (aq.) in a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, and vortexed vigorously for 10 s on a Vortex-2 Genie shaker to thoroughly mix the sample. The mixture was incubated at 40◦C for 1 h, and 135 μL of 0.1% formic acid (aq.) was then added to carry out the extraction process with a supported liquid extraction cartridge. After elution with 2.0 mL dichloromethane, the sample was dried, and 200 μL of MeOH:H2O (1:1, v/v) was applied to prepare the sample for UPLC-MS/MS analysis.

A Waters ACQUITY UPLC system and a SCIEX API-4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source were applied to determine the 17 target XEs in the human urine samples, and multiple reaction monitoring mode was used to qualify and quantify the target analytes. BP-3 was detected in the positive ionization mode, whereas the other 16 analytes were ionized in negative polarity. Separation of the target analytes was achieved with a Thermo Scientific Syncronis C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 3 μm). The mobile phases for the UPLC system were 0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (mobile phase A1), Milli-Q water (mobile phase A2), and acetonitrile (mobile phase B1). To determine the six metabolites of phthalates, four parabens, triclosan, and triclocarban, mobile phase A1 and B1 were utilized to elute 12 target analytes, and mobile phase A2 and B1 were used to separate and ionize BPA, BP-3, and three alkyl phenolic compounds. The column temperature and sample tray temperature were set at 30◦C and 4 ◦C, respectively, and the injection volume was 10 μL. Data acquisition and processing was performed using Analysts 1.6.2 software.

## 2.5. Method validation of XE metabolite measurement

The analytical characteristics of the UPLC-MS/MS method in terms of linearity and limits of quantification (LOQs) were evaluated to achieve quality assurance and control for the analysis of 17 analytes in urine samples. A six-level matrix-match calibration method with artificial urine as blank matrix was applied to achieve reliable quantification, and the linearity was confirmed by coefficient of determination (R2). SIL-ISTDs were used to calibrate the retention time and instrumental error. Linear range of target analytes were from 10 to 1500 ng/mL for MEP, MP, triclosan, triclocarban, and benzophenone, from 0.10 to 50.00 ng/mL from 4-t-OP and NP, and from 1 to 500 ng/mL for the other 10 analytes. In this study, matrix-match calibration curve of 17 target analytes fits the weighted (1/x) linear regression, and R2 > 0.990. LOQs (S/N ≥ 10) in artificial urine were 0.10 ng/mL for NP and 4-t-OP, those of the other analytes were 0.3 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were assessed by repeated analysis of these standard solutions of five times on the same day or on four consecutive days, respectively. The precision and accuracy of intra-day and inter-day analyses for 17 target analytes in artificial urine met the suggestion of European Medicines Agency.

## 2.6. Outcomes to be studied

The demographics, clinical characteristics and urinary metabolites of XEs of both high and low exposure groups would be explored. The association of XE questionnaire scores vs. eGFR, urinary XE levels vs. high exposure risk / XE questionnaire scores, and urinary XE levels vs. eGFR / albuminuria would be further elucidated. In short, an effort to find the connection of lifestyle and dietary habits, urinary XE metabolites level and kidney function would be performed.

## 2.7. Statistical analysis

The demographics and clinical characteristics among these two groups were compared by Student’s t-test with values expressed as means with standard deviations for normally distributed data and categorical variables were tested using the chi-square test. The value of XEs metabolites (corrected by urinary creatinine) expressed as median with interquartile range among these two groups were compared by nonparametric independent Mann-Whitney U test. The simple linear regression and multiple regression were both applied to examine the association of independent variables and eGFR after adjusting other covariates, and the potentially clinical covariates were age, SBP, vitamin D, high exposure scores, body-mass index and gender. To assess to associations between metabolites of XEs’ concentration and questionnaire scores, odds ratio to get high exposure scores (>5 points) was calculated by binary logistic regression with forward elimination of data. The statistically significant variables of demographics and clinical characteristics were enrolled to model 1 as adjustment factors. In model 2, several clinically important variables including diabetes, gender and eGFR were enrolled as adjustment factors. Simple linear and multiple linear regression were both used to assess the associations of metabolites of XEs’ concentration with total questionnaire scores after adjusting age, and the associations of metabolites of XEs’ concentration with eGFR in CKD subgroup after adjusting age. The associations between metabolites of XEs’ concentration with UACR were also evaluated by multiple linear regression, and the covariates were MEHP, MnBP, MP, BP, EP, BP-3, BPA and age.
Metabolites of XEs’ concentration among 4 groups of CKD stage 0 to CKD III were compared by nonparametric independent Kruskal-Wallis test, whereas one-way ANOVA was performed to compare the difference of age and total exposures among these 4 groups.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to predict the probability of a binary outcome including variables vs CKD, metabolites of XEs’ concentration vs. total exposure scores and metabolites of XEs’ concentration vs. UACR > 30 mg/g (spot urine sample). Differences were examined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Continuous variables were tested for normal distribution using the skewness, kurtosis and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. All statistical analyses were two-tailed, and a value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) version 26.0 for Mac.

3.  Results
questionnaires from 887 subjects initially, and then randomly selected 120 subjects, comprising 60 people with XE exposure scores > 5 points, and 60 people with scores ≤ 5 points (Fig. 1), to measure urinary XE metabolites. Among the 887 subjects who completed the questionnaire-based investigation (Table 1), the high exposure group had a lower SBP (128.31 ± 16.87 vs. 133.05 ± 17.87, P = 0.003), lower vitamin D (25.62 ± 8.65 vs. 29.67 ± 9.88, P < 0.001), better eGFR (93.69 ± 23.15 vs. 93.69 ± 23.15, P < 0.001), and better serum albumin (4.66 ± 0.26 vs. 4.59 ± 0.24, P = 0.001) than the lower exposure group, although both groups shared similar urine albumin creatinine excretion ratio (UACR) (80.13 ± 296.61 vs. 53.49 ± 266.82, P = 0.339) and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index (3.25 ± 2.63 vs. 3.13 ± 4.13, P = 0.736). The higher exposure group seemed to have a higher level of education (P < 0.001), a higher proportion of smokers (P = 0.048) and a lower proportion of people engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry related occupation. Among the 120 subjects whose urinary XE metabolites were measured (Table 2), the group with higher scores had a higher prevalence of CKD (46.7% vs. 16.7%, P < 0.001) than the lower exposure group, although they had similar eGFR, and higher urinary levels of MEHP (10.08 (6.10–13.43) vs. 6.0.29 (3.92–10.39), P < 0.001) and BPA (10.08 (7.31–12.46) vs. 8.60 (7.43–9.79), P = 0.012). The subjects of high exposure group mainly resided in the rural area (70%, P < 0.001).

Urine samples from 120 subjects were used to estimate 17 XE metabolites. As indicated by one-way ANOVA, urinary XE metabolites did not appear to be distributed in a descending or ascending manner from CKD stage 0 to stage 3. Urinary levels of MEHP were found to be significantly positively associated with total exposure scores (β ± SE: 0.033 ± 0.009, P < 0.001) and significantly inversely associated with eGFR (β ± SE: 2.465 ± 0.794, P = 0.006). Multivariate regression analyses of the CKD subgroup (n = 38) showed that higher levels of MEHP, EP (β ± SE: 0.518 ± 0.154, P = 0.003), NP (β ± SE: 56.464 ± 23.19, P = 0.025), and BP-3 (β ± SE: 0.083 ± 0.029, P = 0.01) were associated with lower eGFR, after adjusting for age. As shown in Fig. 2c, ROC curves for UACR > 30 mg/g based on concentrations of urinary XE metabolites indicate that higher EP, MnBP, and triclocarban may predict increased albuminuria. By applying simple linear multivariate regression to urinary XEs and UACR, EP was found to be significantly associated with increased UACR (β = 1.934, 95% CI: 0.135–3.733, P = 0.035), whereas MP was inversely associated with UACR.

In this cross-sectional community-based study, we demonstrated that lifestyle and dietary habits involving frequent contact with plastic products could increase urinary MEHP excretion. The questionnaire-based assessment indicated that high XE exposure probably led to worse renal function. Elevated urine concentrations of MEHP, EP, NP, and BP-3 were associated with lower eGFR in the CKD subgroup, whereas EP was linked to increased UACR. The overall result indicated that exposure to XEs, especially DEHP, may be detrimental to renal function, as assessed by direct estimation or via questionnaire-based investigation.

Through the binary logistic regression analyses of urinary XE metabolites and questionnaire-based exposure scores, model 1 showed that higher urine levels of MEHP (OR: 1.555, 95% CI: 1.174–2.060) and BP-3 (OR: 1.011, 95% CI: 1.002–1.019) were related to high exposure scores (>5 points), after adjusting for age, Na, Ca, albumin, vitamin D, SBP, white blood cell, total bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, and heart rate. Model 2 showed that higher MEHP (OR: 3.037, 95% CI: 1.274–7.241), BPA (OR: 3.398, 95% CI: 1.060–10.890) and BP-3 (OR: 1.025, 95% CI: 1.002–1.048) were independently associated with high exposure scores after adjusting for the diabetes, gender, eGFR and parameters stated above. Besides, urinary MEHP and 4-t-OP were both markedly positively associated with total exposure score, independent of age, as indicated by the multivariate linear regression analyses. C.-Y. Chen et al.

associated with rhinitis, eczema, and asthma. XEs have a negative impact on kidney function, which has been demonstrated in several epidemiological studies. DEHP and triclosan exposure significantly increased urinary β2-myoglobin levels in the Korean population. Various metabolites of phthalates are positively linked to kidney injury markers, including UACR, urinary β2-microglobulin, and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. The principal mechanism of DEHP causing nephropathy is that DEHP induces EMT in the renal proximal tubule, which contributes to renal fibrosis, and can disturb the intrarenal and systemic renin-angiotensin.

Our study also showed similar results, i.e., MEHP, EP, NP, and BP-3 had an inverse association with eGFR in the CKD subgroup (Table 5). NP, a member of the phenol family, has been demonstrated to enhance reactive oxygen species that were reported to be the major mechanisms in various etiologies of CKD. Chronic exposure to low-dose NP would aggravate adenine-induced CKD in rats. Benzophenone also showed a significantly positive association with UACR among healthy women in a Korean study. The effects of phenols, parabens, and benzophenones, which may share common exposure sources with phthalates, seem to be detrimental to renal function.

Our study revealed that lifestyle and diet questionnaires on XE exposure could be used to screen patients at high risk of CKD, who might often come into contact with DEHP and BPA. In order to achieve economical, convenient, and rapid screening, we adopted the method of questionnaire-based interviewing to investigate the risks of exposure to XEs. Therefore, the questionnaires we designed cover all aspects of Taiwanese lifestyle and eating habits that may lead to exposure to XEs.

Following binary logistic regression after eGFR adjustment (model 2), we found that higher urinary MEHP, BPA and BP-3 might predict a higher probability of questionnaires with high exposure scores (Table 4). Urinary MEHP and BPA were also positively associated with elevated exposure scores through univariate linear regression, and MEHP independently had a positive association with higher scores via multivariate linear regression after age adjustment (Table 5, Fig. 2b). Subjects with high exposure scores (>5 points) were significantly associated with decreased eGFR (Table 3). The questionnaire-based interview revealed that frequent exposure to plastic tableware, perfumes, or frequent use of microwave ovens to heat food covered with plastic wrap or intake of specific foods was correlated with urinary phthalate metabolite levels.

Questionnaire-based interviewing was also applied to ascertain the relationship of the estimated phthalate intake volume, renal function, and biomarkers of kidney injury in children who consumed phthalate-tainted foods in Taiwan in 2011. Epidemiologic studies often applied questionnaire-based interviewing in combination with direct measurement to estimate the potential intake of environmental endocrine disruptors, e.g. U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) exploring exposure risk of heavy metals, perfluoroalkyl substances, parabens, phenols and phthalate, dietary predictors of phthalate and BPA surveys in pregnant women, and phthalate related metabolic syndromes survey in U.S. and China. Since XEs, especially phthalates, which are often used as plasticizers, are distributed in the environment around us, we can be easily exposed to it unintentionally. XEs can be found in building materials, floorings, car interiors, clothing, furniture, toys, and food contact materials (Table 8). Because phthalate plasticizers are not firmly bound to PVC, they can leach, drift, or vaporize into the indoor air and atmosphere, foods, and other materials. A Swiss study demonstrated that phthalate plasticizers are generally detected in toys in European markets, except banned DEHP-containing toys, which may still be legally used in manufacturing PVC toys in certain countries. The amount of plastic materials used by Taiwanese people is higher than that of Europeans. Previous studies have also shown that the serum concentrations of DEHP in Taiwanese individuals is 3-folds higher than that in Europeans.

Although our study showed a positive association between urinary BPA and the questionnaire scores, it failed to show similar results without eGFR adjustment (Table 4, model 1). Comparing BPA levels and eGFR in the CKD subgroup, we found that urinary BPA levels in our CKD cohort gradually reduced along with a decline in eGFR (Table 5). This was contrary to our expectation that people with CKD would have higher urinary levels of BPA as a result of increased risk of exposure. A study carried out in the USA also showed a comparable result, where children with CKD had lower urinary levels of BPA. The most appropriate explanation for this phenomenon is the reduced intake of these substances, because people with CKD may have been instructed to have healthier dietary habits than the general population.

This phenomenon might suggest that decreased eGFR probably lead to decreased BPA excretion, and imply the limitation of cross-sectional studies and risk of reverse causation. In contrast, a previous study found that in vitro exposure to BPA would make mouse podocytes less viable, augment apoptosis, and reduce nephrin and podocin expression. Exposure to BPA and phthalates may initiate glomerular hyperfiltration, and increase the temporary clearance of BPA and phthalates, which may accelerate renal function deterioration.

The significant inverse association of urinary EP with eGFR and UACR is noteworthy. Parabens can generate oxidative stress and induce lipid peroxidation in the kidney and liver of animal models, and the effects have been noted in several experimental and epidemiological studies. A large cross-sectional study of the Korean national environmental health survey also confirmed the negative association between urinary EP and eGFR. Because the kidney is a metabolic organ that undergoes abundant oxidation reactions in mitochondria, it is susceptible to damage by oxidative stress; several studies have shown that oxidative stress can accelerate a decline in kidney function. To our knowledge, this study is the first to find that urinary EP is negatively linked to both eGFR and UACR. This suggests the potential role of EP in the pathogenesis of CKD.

Among the 887 subjects, we found that the high exposure group was younger, and also had lower blood pressure and better kidney function. After adjustments for age, blood pressure, Vitamin D, body-mass index, and gender, the high exposure score showed negative associations with eGFR. This suggests that lifestyle and dietary habits involving XE exposure possibly affect kidney function. Plastic materials are extensively used in Taiwan. High exposure to XEs can occur via prolonged ingestion of food and beverages, as well as long-term contact with perfumes and personal care products, prepared phthalates to enhance texture and luster. In order to reduce the risk of exposure to XEs, we instructed the participants to drink more water to flush out XEs from the body, eat a high-fiber diet to increase the excretion of XE from the colon, eat more fresh fruits and vegetables to overcome oxidative stress, eat more fresh food and less prepacked food to avoid DEHP, and refrain from reheating food in plastic containers or plastic wrapping in the microwave.

This study has some limitations. First, as a cross-sectional study, the associations found in the current study do not indicate causal connections with CKD. Second, the urine samples were collected based on spot urine, not on 24 h collection, which may imply some bias. Third, the results of urine measurement might be affected by the subjects’ diet and lifestyle habits in the past several days prior to sample collection. Nevertheless, the nature of our questionnaire design was based on frequency and we speculated that these participants’ lifestyle and dietary habits were comparable as usual. Hence, the connection between XEs and questionnaire scores that we explored, probably could mitigate the limitation in the timing of urine sampling. Fourth, it was difficult to cover all the aspects of exposure to XEs in the questionnaire with regard to living environment, e.g., cosmetics, sunscreen, medicines, medical equipment, architecture, and dental filling materials. Further, the answers provided by the participants in terms of frequency were affected by their memory and current emotion. Fifth, relatively fewer subjects were selected for measuring urinary XE in comparison with the subjects in the questionnaire survey. Due to budget constraints and the remaining urine sample volume, we could only randomly select 60 subjects from low exposure group and 60 subjects from high exposure group for XEs test, respectively. Although the mean age, gender, SBP and eGFR of the 120 subjects selected for measurement of urinary XE are similar to those of 887 subjects, it still lacks sufficient persuasiveness that the XE’s data of these 120 individuals could represent the entire population. To overcome these limitations, longitudinal investigations with extensive and repetitive measurements should be conducted in the future, as they are likely to provide more information about the possible unfavorable effect of prolonged exposure to XEs. To our knowledge, this study is the first to directly link questionnaire-based investigation with urinary XE levels, which makes the study more reliable, and demonstrates questionnaires to be a more convenient and economic tool to potentially replace the actual measurement of XEs. Therefore, the results would provide us with more confidence in promoting health education deep within the community.

5. Conclusions

A cross-sectional community-based study in four districts of northeastern Taiwan established the association between urinary levels of MEHP, EP, NP, and BP-3 with decline in renal function in a CKD cohort, wherein EP was likely linked to higher UACR. MEHP was positively linked to total exposure score, and might independently predict high exposure scores. MEHP seemed to have the strongest correlation with high exposure scores and decline in kidney function. We also noticed that high exposure scores were associated with decreased eGFR, after adjustments for age, blood pressure, Vitamin D, BMI, and gender. It appears that frequent contact with plastic products is associated with the incidental intake of XEs which are potentially detrimental to the kidney. To prevent CKD, we may promote health education in lifestyle and dietary habits to avoid XE exposure. C.-Y. Chen et al.
