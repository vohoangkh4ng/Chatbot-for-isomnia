# Title: Trends in environmental chemical concentrations in the Canadian population: Biomonitoring data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007â€“2017

## Summary: This article presents an analysis of ten years of biomonitoring data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS), focusing on environmental chemical concentrations in the Canadian population. The study evaluates temporal trends in exposure to 39 chemicals measured in blood or urine, identifying significant decreases in concentrations for 19 chemicals, including notable reductions in di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Conversely, two pyrethroid pesticide metabolites showed increasing trends. The findings highlight the importance of ongoing biomonitoring to track changes in chemical exposures over time.
