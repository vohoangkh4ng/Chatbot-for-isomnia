# Title: The silver linings of mercury: Reconsideration of its impacts on living organisms from a multi-timescale perspective

## Summary: This review article examines the long-term effects of mercury (Hg) on living organisms by analyzing its role across different timescales: geological periods, human history, and contemporary history. It highlights the historical significance of Hg, particularly in relation to mass extinction events and oceanic anoxia, while also addressing the health risks associated with Hg poisoning incidents. The authors argue for a balanced understanding of Hg's impacts, suggesting that safe and sustainable applications of Hg are possible with improved knowledge of ecosystem dynamics and proactive measures to mitigate anthropogenic effects on the Hg cycle.
