# Title: Associations between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and markers of liver injury in the US adult population

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and liver function test (LFT) indicators in a sample of 6046 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2007 and 2016. The study finds significant associations between certain phthalates, particularly di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (Î£DEHP), and elevated levels of liver enzymes such as ALT, GGT, and ALP, as well as total bilirubin. Conversely, some phthalates were negatively associated with serum albumin levels. The findings suggest that exposure to phthalates may have adverse effects on liver function, highlighting the need for further research on the toxicological impacts of these chemicals.
