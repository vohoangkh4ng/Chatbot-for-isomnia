## Potential health risks due to in-car aerosol exposure across ten global cities

### A B S T R A C T

Car microenvironments significantly contribute to the daily pollution exposure of commuters, yet health and socioeconomic studies focused on in-car exposure are rare. This study aims to assess the relationship between air pollution levels and socioeconomic indicators (fuel prices, city-specific GDP, road density, the value of statistical life (VSL), health burden and economic losses resulting from exposure to fine particulate matter ≤2.5 μm; PM2.5) during car journeys in ten cities: Dhaka (Bangladesh); Chennai (India); Guangzhou (China); Medellín (Colombia); São Paulo (Brazil); Cairo (Egypt); Sulaymaniyah (Iraq); Addis Ababa (Ethiopia); Blantyre (Malawi); and Dar-es-Salaam (Tanzania). Data collected by portable laser particle counters were used to develop a proxy of car-user exposure profiles. Hotspots on all city routes displayed higher PM2.5 concentrations and disproportionately high inhaled doses. For instance, the time spent at the hotspots in Guangzhou and Addis Ababa was 26% and 28% of total trip time, but corresponded to 54% and 56%, respectively, of the total PM2.5 inhaled dose. With the exception of Guangzhou, all the cities showed a decrease in percent length of hotspots with an increase in GDP and VSL. Exposure levels were independent of fuel prices in most cities. The largest health burden related to in-car PM2.5 exposure was estimated for Dar-es-Salam (81.6 ± 39.3 μg m³), Blantyre (82.9 ± 44.0) and Dhaka (62.3 ± 32.0) with deaths per 100,000 of the car commuting population per year of 2.46 (2.28–2.63), 1.11 (0.97–1.26) and 1.10 (1.05–1.15), respectively. However, the modest health burden of 0.07 (0.06–0.08), 0.10 (0.09–0.12) and 0.02 (0.02–0.03) deaths per 100,000 of the car commuting population per year were estimated for Medellin (23 ± 13.7 μg m³), Sao Paulo (25.6 ± 11.7) and Sulaymaniyah (22.4 ± 15.0), respectively. Lower GDP was found to be associated with higher economic losses due to health burdens caused by air pollution in most cities, indicating a socioeconomic discrepancy. This assessment of health and socioeconomic parameters associated with in-car PM2.5 exposure highlights the importance of implementing plausible solutions to make a positive impact on peoples’ lives in these cities. # Introduction

Exposure to airborne fine particulate matter is amongst the top ten environmental health risk factors globally. PM2.5 exposure is a function of the concentration of pollutants and the time spent by individuals in any microenvironment. Commuters are exposed to high levels of pollutants, which often do not meet air quality standards. Here, we analysed first-hand datasets of PM2.5 concentrations measured in-car during commuting in ten global cities to provide unique insights in relation to excessive PM2.5 exposure, traffic conditions, fuel prices, health burden and economic losses. Mitigation strategies were developed that meet inter-related Sustainable Development Goals: Good health (SDG3), Clean energy (SDG7), and Sustainable cities (SDG11). By studying in-car aerosol exposure in a range of different cities, effective air pollution mitigation measures and best practice guidance may be developed including, using electric buses, public transport and active urban mobility.

Commuters’ exposure to concentrations of traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) can be 3–10 times greater than their exposure to background pollutants. The high concentrations of TRAP tend to accumulate near, or on, roads, with the highest exposure zones identified within 200–300 m of busy roads and highways. Exposure levels to TRAP in transport microenvironments are related to factors such as time and activity patterns, travel mode, vehicle settings, ambient pollutant concentrations, traffic density, road characteristics, and meteorological conditions. It is important to identify individual TRAP contributions from different transport microenvironments to enable accurate and effective information to be obtained for reducing respective personal exposure.

Within cities, areas with higher pollutant levels than their surroundings are known as “hotspots”. Hotspots are usually characterised by large spatial and temporal concentration gradients and people working or living in these zones have the possibility of being exposed to elevated air pollution levels. Therefore, it is vital to understand the spatio-temporal distribution of exposure levels in road hotspots to carry out a comprehensive risk assessment that can consider both actual and representative exposure levels. The distribution of air pollutants has been found to be inequitable, with people living in most deprived areas generally suffering from high levels of exposure. The associations between exposure levels and the geographical distribution of vulnerable communities are, however, more complicated and less universal than often implied. Relationships between socioeconomic and environmental risk factors have been revealed to diverge between study areas, status and scales of socioeconomic measurement, but population characteristics which explain these associations at a local level are still not fully understood.

Policy measures to control transport sector pollution is challenging to implement since transport emissions result from non-point sources where there is an absence of proof for individual responsibility. Thus, alternative demand-side policy measures (e.g. controlling fuel prices through subsidy removal) can discourage owners from using their cars frequently and instead encourage them to seek alternatives, resulting in reduced congestion and pollution levels. It has been proven that a 50% increase in fuel prices could lower congestion costs by US$22 million in the short-term and by US$69 million in the medium-term. Another study showed that imposing gasoline tax and removing fuel subsidies would reduce gasoline use by 43%, resulting in a 25% reduction in auto and microbus miles driven. However, other studies showed that petrol price changes had no impact on air pollution. Therefore, elucidating the effect of fuel price as an air pollution mitigation measure is still an open scientific question that has been investigated here.

Several studies have attempted to quantify the health impact and economic losses attributed to ambient PM2.5 exposure levels that exceed health standards. The health burden resulting from PM2.5 exposure is quantified using exposure–response functions based on four components: the exposed population size; the baseline incidence rate; the effect estimated from epidemiological studies; and the change in air quality.

Translating pollutant concentrations and exposure into the number of deaths caused and national economic losses occurred highlights this important issue for policy makers in more relatable terms. Literature has focused on estimating the health burden and economic losses caused by exposure to ambient PM2.5 levels in several global cities. However, studies have not focused on the direct burden and losses incurred by anthropogenic activities such as working in certain industries or traffic commutes. Such assessments for short-term exposure, especially for in-car exposure, are rare and hence is one of the focus areas for this work.

As shown in Table 1, limited studies have reported PM exposure in transport microenvironments in cities in least developed, low-income or developing countries. A summary of relevant previous research reveals a lack of studies quantifying and comparing the length of hotspots on typical routes and variations in time spent at them in different cities. Most cities follow the international trend where private cars remain a preferred means of transport; however, their focus has generally not been on estimating the potential inhaled doses of PM2.5 at hotspots and the effect of fuel pricing on air pollution exposure in each city.

Studies have also not focused on health burden and economic cost evaluation of PM exposure in transport microenvironments. Our earlier work produced an internationally comparable in-car PM2.5 exposure data across ten global cities. Thus, this work aims to carry out an in-depth complimentary analysis for understanding the PM2.5 hotspot lengths and time spent on the routes as a function of total commuting length/time in these cities and their association with potential inhaled doses, health burden (i.e. premature deaths) and socioeconomic (i.e. GDP, fuel pricing, economic losses) factors, and discussing the associated underlying reasons.

2.2. Hotspot analysis
Hotspots along the routes in cities studied were identified by counting data points exceeding 90th percentiles (P90) of the one-minute average PM2.5 concentrations during windows-open setting. The P90 was calculated for each city using the overall dataset, including the three measured car settings, following the methodology described in Kumar et al. (2021). To carry out the hotspot analysis, PM2.5 concentrations were used to compare the inhaled doses at the hotspots versus those at free-flow segments of roads across the ten cities (Section 2.3). Furthermore, the inhaled doses at hotspots were compared to different socio-economic parameters for each city including: gross domestic product; the value of statistical life; and road density (Section 2.3). To investigate the effect of fuel price variations on PM2.5 concentrations, relevant data was sourced for each city from secondary sources including: fuel prices; city specific congestion parameters such as car density and average speeds; population size; number of cars per inhabitant (Section 2.4); and the inhaled doses per unit distance (Section 2.3). Finally, health burden and economic losses were derived using published methodologies (Section 2.5) utilising PM2.5 concentration data, baseline mortality rates, car commuter population size and value of statistical life. Data processing and statistical analyses for this section were carried out using Excel and R statistical software (R Core Team, 2019) with the software package openair (Carslaw and Ropkins, 2012).

2.3. Inhaled dose estimation
The data collected under windows-open setting was used to quantify the time spent in hotspots or free-flow conditions and their potential inhaled PM2.5 doses. For each city, the average time spent in hotspots was calculated as the number of PM2.5 data points (one-minute averaged) exceeding P90 (Section 2.2); the rest of the data points were considered as occurring during free-flow conditions. It is worth noting that because the P90 was calculated using the data collected in all three car settings (as described in SI Section S1), therefore the time spent in hotspots during windows-open setting is not always 10%. The mean lengths of hotspots (Table 5) were calculated by multiplying the average speed of the car during the journey (Table 2) and average time spent in hotspots (Table 5). The quantity of potential inhaled dose is a function of the PM2.5 concentration (C; μg m3) inside a car, time spent during a journey and the respiratory rate of the commuter, which is influenced by gender, age and health. We estimated inhaled dose both by per unit time (IDt; μg kg-1 h-1) and per unit distance travelled basis (IDd; μg km-1). IDt during a car journey was estimated using Eq. (1) (USEPA, 1992):
IDt = (C × IR)/BW (1)
where IR (m3 h-1) is the inhalation rate, which was taken as 0.8184 m3 h-1 for adult males while seated (Hinds, 1999), and BW (kg) is body weight for an individual, which was taken as an average of 75.4 kg for the age group of 30–44 years. Since the estimated inhaled doses for male (0.8184 m³ h⁻¹) and female (0.6642 m³ h⁻¹) follow the same trend due to the constant value of IR used in Eq. (1), the discussion remains valid for both the genders. Therefore, we only refer to male doses in the subsequent discussion for the purpose of brevity. The IDd allowed the elimination of the differences in route length and the time spent inside cars among the ten cities, thus allowing a relative comparison to be made, as shown by Eq. (2):

IDd = (C × IR × t)/l

where t (h⁻¹) is the time of each trip and l (m) is the distance travelled along the route in each city. Eqs. (1) and (2) also allowed us to calculate the percentage of time spent at hotspots, percentage of inhaled PM2.5 doses, and the ratio of PM2.5 levels at hotspots and free-flow conditions.

Further analysis enabled us to assess the relationships between socioeconomic factors of cities and their hotspot parameters. We considered the following socioeconomic factors in our analysis: city-specific gross domestic product per capita (GDP; US$), value of statistical life (VSL; US$/person), road density, fuel prices, health burden and economic losses. City-specific GDP per capita is shown in SI Table S4. VSL is an economic value that is used to quantify the benefit of avoiding a fatality and differs from one country to another, and road density (DR; km⁻¹) which is a ratio of the total length (L; km) of all roads in the administrative area of the city (A; km²) to the total population (P) of the city:

DR = L/(A × P)

The details of the administrative area of cities, the total population living in the respective administrative area, and length of different categories of roads in the cities are provided in SI Table S4.

Fuel pricing and PM2.5 concentrations

Parameters used for this analysis include fuel prices, average PM2.5 concentrations, inhaled doses per unit distance, city-specific time spent in traffic per year such as car density and average speeds, population size and the number of cars per inhabitant. Fuel prices (US$ per litre) can be considered as a reflection of subsidy levels in a country. For instance, lower fuel prices indicate higher subsidies considering a uniform international market price for the fuel. Average in-car PM2.5 concentrations during windows-open and the corresponding total daily inhaled doses indicate levels of air pollution that car commuters are exposed to during travel. We considered the average speed as a measure of congestion since higher speeds mean a relatively higher free-flow of traffic and vice-versa. Finally, the number of cars per inhabitant is considered an indication of both the purchasing power in a country as well as commuter reliance on cars due to a lack of transport alternatives. The results of this analysis were used to draw correlations between fuel pricing and air pollution levels.

Health burden and economic cost of PM2.5 exposure

We estimated the health burden resulting from exposure to PM2.5 levels during car commutes to the exposed population of car commuters (CC). CC (# of car commuters) in each city is estimated as a product of car density (# of cars/city) and average car occupancy (# of car commuters/car), using the Eq. (4) and the parameters listed in Tables 2 and 3 show the exposed population (CC) and % of CC from city population:

CC = Car density × Average car occupancy

HB was estimated using Eq. (5).

HB = [(RR - 1)/RR] × B × CC

where HB (# of premature deaths) is the health burden; B (deaths per 100,000 people) is the baseline mortality rate within the population of interest; and CC (# of car commuters) is the exposed population of car commuters. RR (-) is the relative risk of mortality when an entire population is exposed to pollution levels that exceed a reference concentration. Numerous types of RR functions have been developed and used in the literature. For example, some studies have assumed a linear relation between mortality and PM2.5 exposure; however, these tend to underestimate the number of premature deaths. Integrated exposure response (IER) functions have been adopted by several studies that focused on indoor microenvironments such as vehicles; however, there is considerable uncertainty about the IER function and its fitted parameters. Statistical time-series analysis carried out in epidemiology studies have been typically used for short-term exposures where log-linear functions have been employed for both long-term (one-year or more) and short-term (defined as a few hours to one day) exposures. Considering the above limitations and the context of our work involving short-term exposure, we adopted the log-linear function. RR is estimated using Eq. (6) that has been used in a diverse range of previous studies.

RR = exp(βPM2.5(Ci - C0)) or Ci > C0

RR = 1 for Ci ≤ C0

where Ci is the average in-car PM2.5 concentration under windows-open setting; C0 is the threshold concentration below which no additional health impacts are calculated. The average exposure concentrations are based on measurements taken on a specific route in each city that is considered a representation of a car commuter’s average exposure levels despite the variations such representation might introduce. Standard deviation ranges of Ci are taken into consideration for producing HB numbers with 95% confidence intervals. For the purpose of comparison, average in-car PM2.5 concentrations under recirculation setting are also used to produce estimates for HB. WHO guidelines suggest annual mean PM2.5 concentration at 10 μg m⁻³ and 24-hour mean at 25 μg m⁻³. Here, we set C0 to be equal to the daily mean exposure standards of 25 μg m⁻³, which was also used as a threshold in a study that investigates the impact of daily excess PM2.5 concentrations hours on mortalities. βPM2.5 is the exposure–response coefficient, indicating an increase in mortality due to an increase in PM2.5 concentrations; it is taken as 0.038% per 1 μg m⁻³ increase in PM2.5, based on a systematic review of studies on short-term (24-hr averages) exposure to air pollution and daily mortality of all ages. Most studies that estimate mortality associated with PM2.5 exposure focus on long-term ambient exposures despite the evident impact of short-term PM2.5 exposure on all cause mortalities and morbidities. There is limited work that investigates mortalities caused by short-term exposures based on 24-hr average PM2.5 concentrations while most recent works have extrapolated hourly concentrations during commuting to 24-hr average PM concentrations. These studies assessed the correlation between PM2.5 exposure concentrations preceding the incident of mortality by one or two days. This current work adopts these basic concepts and extends to provide a unique insight by translating the cumulative impact of daily short-term exposure during car commutes over one year into the expected premature deaths.
B in Eq. (5) is country-specific all-cause mortality rates per 100,000 people (Table 3). It is reasonably assumed that B for each city is equal to the country-specific mortality rate due to the lack of availability of city-specific data for all cities. Moreover, it was preferable to reference our data to a common source to reduce uncertainties and make estimates comparable. This figure is used to derive the hourly baseline mortality by dividing the annual rate into 365 days and 24 h, to accommodate for the hourly exposures focused on in this work.
Since RR and B are based on hourly observations and rates, the HB indicates deaths resulting from hourly exposure to excess PM2.5 concentrations during car commutes at peak and off-peak hours. Average concentrations (C) during MP, OP and EP are used to produce an RRi corresponding to each time of the day. The whole exposed population of car commuters (CC) are used with each of the RR’s derived for the three periods (MP, OP and EP) as it is assumed that the whole car commuting population will probably travel for at least an hour during all three-time segments throughout the year. Time spent in traffic by a car commuter for each city is derived using field data collected from the campaign and normalised over the average trip length across all cities (Table S5). It is assumed that a typical commuter does three trips (MP, EP, OP) per day during weekdays (5 days/week) giving the total number of hours spent in traffic per year for this study (Table 3). The percentage of time spent in traffic in each time segment (MP, OP and EP) is derived for each city based on the field campaign data (Table S5). Then annual HB is calculated for each time of the day and summed to produce the total (and per 100,000 exposed population of car commuters) HB attributed to the excess PM2.5 car exposure.
The βPM2.5 used to calculate RR is based on 24-hr average while the

The number of cars per inhabitant is calculated by dividing car density (number of cars in each city) by its population (number of inhabitants). concentrations are based on hourly average observations. We assume that the temporal variations in the exposure–response coefficient used to calculate RR provide preliminary estimates on the mortalities caused by in-car exposure to PM2.5 concentrations since the data on the impact of certain hours in the day (car commutes in this case) on mortality rates are unavailable, especially for the studied cities. Also, βPM2.5 indicates a percentage increase in mortalities for every corresponding 1 μgm 3 increase in PM2.5 concentrations, regardless of exposure time. However, the calculations need to be modified to reflect the fraction of time spent in this microenvironment. Ideally 24-hr average PM2.5 concentrations should be used to be consistent with the exposure–response coefficient adopted from literature. However, varied approaches are applied. For example, Zheng et al. used PM exposure during other activities throughout the day, in addition to commuting, such as sleep and work to derive the average daily PM2.5 concentrations to be able to use daily RR values. However, this approach has not been adopted in this study due to unavailability of data on other daily activities in the ten cities but also because the aim of this work has been to focus on in-car exposure related health impacts.

Most epidemiological studies are focused on the exposure to ambient PM2.5 concentrations despite the fact that PM2.5 exposure in microenvironments like households, schools and vehicles, can account for a substantial proportion of ambient PM2.5 exposure-related total mortalities such as 40–60% in the United States, 71–87% in urban China and 81–89% on a global scale. Nevertheless, exposure–response functions derived for ambient PM2.5 exposure can be used for exposure in a microenvironment setting, provided that coefficients are rescaled for population size. Furthermore, our study focuses on windows-open setting for in-car PM2.5 exposure, which is a proxy for on-road ambient concentrations. Hence, it was considered acceptable to use Eqs. (5) and (6) to derive health burden caused by in-car PM2.5 exposure.

Economic loss (EL; US$) is quantified based on the probable number of premature deaths and the Value of Statistical Life (VSL; US$), using Eq. (7).

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Inhaled doses at hotspots

Fig. 1 shows the density plot of in-car PM2.5 concentrations measured under windows-open in all studied cities during MP, EP and OP hours. These plots show areas where values are more concentrated over a particular range of PM2.5 concentrations and also indicate how differently the hotspots condition frequency occurs in each city. Similar behaviour regarding the PM2.5 concentration distribution may be observed in some cities. For example, ADD, BLZ, and DAR show a low-density spread over the concentration range, especially during morning peak hours as opposed to those (MDE, SAO, and SUL) having stark peaks in a small concentration range. The hotspots frequency of PM2.5 concentrations was consistently lower during OP hours for all the cities, indicated by their shapes being mostly more skewed to the left during OP hours than other times of the day. The exception was CAI, where the EP hours showed slightly lower occurrences of extreme values than OP (mid-day) hours mainly because mid-day is not considered OP.

The MP hours showed the highest frequency of hotspot conditions in all cities, except in CHE and DAC, where the frequency of extreme values during MP and EP hours were similar despite higher traffic congestion during evenings shown by longer trip durations compared to MP. This might be due to favorable meteorological conditions (wind speed) during evening hours that contribute to the dispersion of pollutants. These results demonstrate that, in most cities, relatively high concentrations of PM2.5 are more frequent during MP hours whilst low concentrations occur more frequently during OP hours.

The values of P90 during windows-open across cities varied from 34 μg m³ (SUL) to 117 μg m³ (DAR). PM2.5 concentrations in free-flow driving conditions greatly varied among the cities (Table 4). African and Asian cities (ADD, BLZ, DAR, DAC, CHE, and CAN) showed relatively higher concentration levels of PM2.5 at hotspots compared with Latin American (SAO, MDE) and Middle Eastern cities (SUL). The increase in hotspot concentrations compared with those of free-flow conditions ranged from 2-times (CHE) to 3.5-times (CAN and SUL). This range is greater than that observed in a small town in the UK, where traffic intersections can result in 16% higher PM2.5 compared with those on the rest of the route with free-flow conditions.

In order to understand the magnitude of the impact of hotspots compared to free-flow conditions in the total potential inhaled dose, we calculated a statistical summary of PM2.5 concentrations in all the cities studied, both during free-flow and hotspots driving conditions during windows-open car setting (Table 5). The time-based inhaled doses ranged from 0.59 (SAO) to 1.78 (BLZ) whereas relatively lower values of 0.17 (SUL) to 0.71 (DAR) μg kg⁻¹h⁻¹ at the hotspots, were recorded during free-flow. The distance-based inhaled doses provided a better understanding of exposure resulting from the hotspots emerging from traffic congestion. These ranged from 0.4 to 5.9 μg km⁻¹ and 1.5–14.3 μg km⁻¹ for free-flow and hotspots, respectively. DAR recorded the highest inhaled doses (14.3 μg km⁻¹), followed by the other African cities (ADD and BLZ), and along with DAC displayed comparatively higher values of 6–8.1 μg km⁻¹. The highest inhaled doses for DAR are due to higher PM2.5 concentrations in free-flow conditions combined with longer time spent at hotspots. Other factors such as presence of street canyons along the routes may have contributed to a disproportionate effect on concentration accumulation on some part of the routes but this information was not available precisely to be able to apportion their effects. Conversely, other cities (SAO, MDE, CAI, CHE and CAN) reported a lower range (2.3–3.7 μg km⁻¹). The ratio of distance-based free-flow to hotspots inhaled doses ranged from 2 to 3.5, which followed the corresponding PM2.5 concentration ratios. Interestingly, cities (MDE, SUL and CAN) showing relatively lower inhaled doses at hotspots displayed the highest hotspot PM2.5 doses/free-flow PM2.5 doses of 3.4 to 3.5. These findings highlight that in these cities the identification of hotspot locations is important, and also that in other cities car commuters are exposed to high concentrations in both free-flow and hotspot conditions. The vehicle fleet is quite different among the studied cities, as shown in SI Table S6. Interestingly, the PM2.5 concentration appears to increase with the number of buses per 10,000 inhabitants in cities, indicating that although cities such as BLZ and ADD may need to consider cleaner buses. In contrast, a lower number of buses per inhabitant in cities like SAO and MDE associated with low PM2.5 concentrations can be associated with a greater availability of underground trains, which use electricity. Finally, it was observed that the high number of two- and three-wheeler vehicles also seems to contribute to the high concentrations of PM2.5 in CHE and DAC, while in MDE the contribution of these kinds of vehicles does not seem to be relevant to increased PM2.5 concentration. In addition, driving routes varied from single to double road lanes. The on-road environment is usually turbulent due to the movement of the vehicles and the first few meters of the road is generally considered as a well-mixed environment. However, the spatial concentration gradients could be expected, which are challenging to capture through in-car studies. Both lanes were used during the monitoring, following the left- or right-hand driving rules in the studied cities. For example, CAN, MDE, SAO, CAI, SUL, and ADD used right-hand lanes of the road as opposed to the other cities using right-hand lanes.

A more comprehensive understanding of PM2.5 inhalation in hotspots and free-flow conditions emerged by plotting the percentage time spent in hotspot and free-flow driving conditions with the corresponding percentage of the inhaled PM2.5 doses. The mean time spent in the car at hotspots across the cities accounted for only about 16% (SAO) to 28% (ADD) of the total time spent on each route but corresponded to much higher inhaled doses, 30% (CHE) to 56% (ADD) of the total commuting doses. Such a disproportionate distribution of inhaled doses has also been reported in previous work. For example, Goel and Kumar found that as little as 2% of the time spent at traffic intersections during a car commute corresponded to up to 25% of total respiratory deposition doses during a car trip. Cross-comparison of cities showed that more than half of the inhaled PM2.5 doses along the route accounted for spending only 26% (CAN) and 28% (ADD) of total time at hotspots. SUL and MDE followed the trend by showing high hotspot to free-flow PM2.5 doses by reporting 41% of inhaled PM2.5 at hotspots, which corresponded to only about 17% of the total commuting time. The contribution of hotspots to the amount of inhaled PM2.5 varied according to the time spent and the PM2.5 concentrations at the hotspots. Irrespective of the cities, the time spent at hotspots was found to be disproportionately lower compared with the inhaled doses suggesting that a relatively small time spent at hotspots could still lead to a significant portion of total inhaled doses during a car commute and the policies targeting the hotspot lengths could bring considerable health benefits to city dwellers.

3.2. Socioeconomic factors and hotspots parameters

The relationship between the hotspots-related parameters and socio-economic factors were assessed for each city to understand their mutual relationship and to allow for comparison between the cities. Correlations between percent length of hotspots and per capita GDP, road density and the VSL were drawn for each city, reflecting the influence of varied levels of economic development of the different countries. Linear, quadratic, cubic and exponential regression models have been found to describe the relationship between air pollution and socio-economic factors as also observed in our case. Fig. 3a shows an opposite trend between percent length of hotspots and per capita GDP for each city, except for CAN. Low-income (US$ <953) African cities (ADD and BLZ) showed the highest percent length of hotspots. This trend starts to decrease following a quadratic regression model, among the cities under study reaching the lowest for SAO (16%), which has the second highest GDP across all cities (US$ 5.9 k). CAN showed the highest GDP (US$ 13.4 k) as well as a high percent length of hotspots, which makes it an outlier. These findings are consistent with earlier studies that show an exponential decay between outdoor PM2.5 concentration and GDP. The percent length of hotspots showed an increasing trend with an increase in road density. This positive correlation, despite being weak, is as expected since road density is an indicator of the congestion of roads in a specific area, suggesting that high percent length of hotspots in cities may be due to high road densities. Finally, the benefits of avoided air pollution mortality are monetised using the VSL. VSL ranged from 0.058 (BLZ) to 1.695 (SAO) million US$ amongst the studied cities, where the percent length of hotspot shows a negative correlation with increase in VSL. This shows that cities with high VSL have lower percent length of hotspots, except for CAN. The above findings suggest | WHO 24h recommendation | hotspot threshold (P90) | morning peak | off-peak | evening peak |

Fig. 1. Density plot of one-minute PM2.5 concentration (μg/m³) in all cities under windows-open car setting during morning and evening peak hours (red and blue lines, respectively) and off-peak hours (green line). The dotted lines represent the WHO PM2.5 24-hour mean guideline of 25 μg/m³ and the P90 value that varies for each city.

correlations between socio-economic factors and conditions of environmental degradation, expressed here as percent length of hotspots in which car commuters are exposed to excess PM2.5 concentrations above daily WHO limits in each city. Presenting this dynamic put matters in perspective for governmental bodies, enabling them to plan urban mobility strategies in cities with consideration to hotspot areas, as it reflects on the local economy. For example, Xie et al. reported that without mitigation, PM2.5 pollution will lead to ~2% GDP loss in China in 2030. Furthermore, scatterplots explored the relationship between hotspot parameters (such as percentage inhaled PM2.5 and the ratio of hotspot to free-flow PM2.5) and socio-economic factors (including city-specific per capita GDP, road density and VSL). An increase in the ratio of hotspot to free-flow PM2.5 is observed for higher city-specific per capita GDP and VSL values. A higher ratio of hotspot to free-flow PM2.5 (>3) was seen for cities with relatively higher GDP such as CAN, SAO and MDE. Such information could benefit cities in addressing the issue of higher congestion zones on frequently traveled routes, such as those followed in this study. Moreover, higher inhaled PM2.5 doses are associated with higher road density, which is expected due to traffic congestion. Unfortunately, did not exhibit strong trends to draw meaningful observations. We believe that mapping pollution parameters against socio-economic parameters on a global scale would provide meaningful trends that would allow cities to understand local pollution drivers and share best practices. However, due to data availability constraints, this study has only provided preliminary concepts that can be built on in future studies Table 4

3.3. Fuel pricing and exposure levels
Fig. 4a–d shows fuel prices versus PM2.5 exposure levels and inhaled doses of car commuters under the windows-open setting. Fig. 4a and b allow categorising cities into three groups. Group 1 (MDE, SAO and SUL) has relatively low fuel prices and the lowest PM2.5 concentrations, defying the expectation that lower fuel prices would encourage traffic and hence increase pollution. The number of cars per inhabitant (indicated by bubble sizes in Fig. 4a) are also low, moderate and high for SUL, MDE and SAO, respectively, showing no trend amongst this group. Furthermore, average speeds (indicated by bubble sizes in Fig. 4b) are relatively low for MDE and SAO and high for SUL; again showing no trend. Low exposure level in MDE and SAO are independent of low fuel prices, high car reliance and low car speeds, and therefore could be due to more green areas around the route, usage of different fuel types and less hotspots as discussed in Section 3.1. For example, Brazil has adopted the use of biofuel ethanol since the 1980s, and currently, all passenger cars can choose between using 100% ethanol or a 27% ethanol +73% gasoline mixture, thus contributing to a reduction of PM concentrations in the last decade in SAO. As for SUL, low PM2.5 concentrations could be due to flowing traffic, indicated by high speed, and a low number of cars per inhabitant. Group 2 (CAI and ADD) exhibits the lowest fuel prices, high PM2.5 concentrations, a relatively high number of cars per inhabitant and moderately lower car speeds. This group follows the expected trend where low fuel prices encourage car ownership and in turn high congestion and high pollution levels as the highest number of deaths occurred as a result of MP exposure for all cities, except for DAR. This is due to the highest PM2.5 concentrations.

a Mean length of hotspots (PM2.5 concentration≥P90) and free-flow (PM2.5 concentration≤P90) are calculated from the average time spent in corresponding traffic flow conditions and average speed of the car during the journey as described in Section 2.3.
b Average time spent in hotspots and free-flow represent the time corresponding to the mean number of data points (one-minute averaged) in each flow condition. L during MP compared with OP and EP for all cities (Table 2). The highest concentrations during MP hours are associated with higher vehicle emissions during these periods in most cities, together with unfavorable pollutant dispersion conditions caused by the usually lower planetary boundary layer during mornings compared with mid-day. This is despite the fact that car commuters spend slightly more time in traffic during EP than MP (Table S5), indicating that pollutant concentrations are a higher contributor to HB than the time spent in traffic. However, for DAR, MP concentrations are higher than EP but the time spent in traffic during EP is 1.7-times that spent during MP causing deaths to be slightly higher during EP. DAR has the highest absolute number of deaths per year of 64 (95% CI: 60–69), followed by ADD 24 (95% CI: 22–27), CAN 16 (95% CI: 13–19) and CAI 15 (95% CI: 14–17) as shown in Fig. 4e and spatially in Fig. S7a. These cities, spreaded across all studied continents except Latin America, experience the highest in-car PM2.5 concentrations and thereby lead to a higher number of premature deaths. However, other cities have high average PM2.5 concentrations but fewer deaths per year, e.g. DAC: 6 (95% CI: 5–6), CHE: 9 (95% CI: 8–10) and BLZ: 2 (95% CI: 2–2); Fig. 4e. The average PM2.5 concentrations in DAR and BLZ is 81.6 ± 39.3 and 82.9 ± 44.0 μgm³, respectively, which indicates that PM2.5 concentrations are not the only variables driving the absolute number of annual premature deaths in each city. It is also driven by the exposed population, which is a product of the number of cars in a city and the car occupancy, which is evidently high for DAR, ADD, CAN and CAI and is in the order of 2–3 million people. Conversely, the exposed population of BLZ is almost 200,000 people which is only ~7% of that of DAR. Furthermore, the exposed population in SAO is ~8 million, but its average in-car PM2.5 concentration is 25.6 ± 11.7 μgm³, resulting in 8 (95% CI: 7–9) deaths per year that is almost equal to those in CHE, which experiences an average PM2.5 concentration of 65.2 ± 26.7 μgm³ (2.5-times that of SAO) but has 15% of SAO’s exposed population. Fig. 4f shows the national HB per year against average PM2.5 concentrations. The baseline mortality is another variable used to derive HB. However, all mortality caused across cities varied within a limited range of around an average of 589.6 (95% CI: 531.2–648.1) deaths per 100,000 (Table 3) and, therefore, was not a major driver in reflecting HB variations between cities. This shows that the number of premature deaths experienced among cities is largely dependent on the exposure to pollution as well as car reliance in a city. This indicates the importance of accounting for both the pollution levels and the choice of transport mode in addressing the issue of commuter exposure.

Table 6 also shows the premature annual deaths resulting in the car commuting population under the windows-closed and recirculation-on scenarios to compare with the windows-open setting, which is discussed further in Section S3 and Fig. S8. The number of deaths per year resulting from recirculation varies between 0 and 2 for most cities except DAR owing to the low PM2.5 concentrations experienced by car commuters who have windows-closed and recirculation on. This further proves the impact of car settings on PM2.5 concentrations and in turn, the national health burden.

The discussion thus far has focused on the absolute number of deaths per year for each city. However, deaths are typically discussed as per 100,000 to provide for a normalised comparison as summarised in Table 6. This analysis eliminates the impact of variations in exposed population variations where DAR showed the highest deaths per 100,000 of car commuting population per year of 2.46 (95% CI: 2.28–2.63), followed by BLZ 1.11 (95% CI: 0.97–1.26) and DAC at 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05–1.15), which had a less absolute number of deaths despite the high PM2.5 levels. ADD, CHE, CAI and CAN experienced air pollution levels of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79–0.97), 0.71 (95% CI: 0.63–0.8), 0.51 (95% CI: 0.48–0.55) and 0.5 (95% CI: 0.41–0.59) deaths per 100,000 of car commuting population/year, respectively. MED, SAO and SUL have modest deaths due to considerably low PM2.5 levels. Table 6 lists the deaths per 100,000 resulting from exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution reported by GBD. These death rates have been adapted for Cities | GDP(USS) | the car commuting population size derived for each city in Table 3 to enable comparison with the absolute annual deaths derived from our analysis. Fig. 4g shows the annual deaths resulting from in-car PM2.5 exposure as a percentage of the total annual deaths within the car commuting population as a result of exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution. The percentage of car exposure deaths varies between 0 and 2% for most cities, which signifies that deaths caused by personal exposure to PM2.5 in-car commutes are a small portion of the overall ambient PM2.5 pollution which is caused by more factors than traffic pollution, such as industrial pollution. However, for the African cities (ADD, BLZ and DAR), the percentages are higher between 10 and 22%, showing that personal exposure to in-car PM2.5 has a larger representation in terms of deaths per year due to the overall ambient PM2.5 exposure. This is due to both the high in-car PM2.5 concentrations as well as the smaller number of deaths per 100,000 caused by ambient PM2.5 pollution reported by GBD (Table 6) in African cities compared to other cities. Overall, this analysis has allowed for translating pollution concentrations into associated premature deaths, which has provided a real-world dimension to scientific data, making it more relatable to policymakers and commuters.

3.4.2. Economic loss
To further quantify the losses felt by each city, EL for each city caused by short-term PM2.5 exposure is calculated as a factor of the country’s VSL in addition to pollution levels. Fig. 4h depicts GDP per capita versus national economic losses incurred by exposure to high PM2.5 levels during car commutes showing that lower GDP is associated with higher economic losses caused by air pollution for most cities. This indicates a socioeconomic discrepancy which has been globally acknowledged where air pollution is more evident in developing countries. CAN and SAO are outliers having higher GDP per capita and high economic losses. Both cities are located in opposite continents. For CAN, it is due to increased pollution exposure levels caused by economic advancement occurring at the expense of compromised environmental efforts. High EL is experienced by SAO despite the low PM2.5 levels due to the combination of the relatively large proportion of the population using cars (37%) and to have the highest VSL amongst the group of considered cities (Table 3). MDE and SUL have modest EL as the observed PM2.5 exposure concentrations did not exceed threshold concentrations. Overall, HB and EL are primarily dependent on pollution exposure levels; however, other factors such as the number of cars per city, car occupancy and national VSL play an important role in such metrics. This analysis reinforces the global nature of air pollution impact as a common issue that costs lives in all cities around the world regardless of the amount of EL incurred.

4. Conclusions and future outlook
We have presented an assessment of the trend between exposure specific GDP, health burden and economic losses resulting from exposure to in-car PM2.5 concentrations in ten cities across four continents (Asia, Latin America, Middle-East, and Africa). The following key conclusions are drawn:
• Irrespective of the cities, a relatively short time spent at hotspots contributed to a significant portion of total inhaled air pollution doses during a car commute. For example, the mean time spent in the car at hotspots in CAN and ADD accounted for only about 26–28% of the total time spent on each route, but corresponded to much higher (54–56%) of the total inhaled doses during a trip.
• An increase in the per cent length of the hotspot was observed with an increase in road density. The per cent length of hotspot shows a negative correlation with an increase in GDP and VSL among cities, except the CAN. | No. of cars per inhabitant | Avg. speed (km/h) |

MDE, SAO and SUL have low pollution levels despite low fuel prices, and the rest of the cities studied experience high pollution levels despite high fuel prices. PM2.5 exposure has proven to be independent of fuel prices indicating that controlling fuel price cannot stand as an effective policy measure on its own in mitigating air pollution since there are other factors that contribute to transport costs and commuter transport choices.
• The highest health burden was experienced by DAR, BLZ and DAC where 2.46 (95% CI: 2.28–2.63), 1.11 (95% CI: 0.97–1.26) and 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05–1.15) deaths per 100,000 of the car commuting population occurred per year, respectively, due to having the highest PM2.5 car exposure concentrations amongst all cities of 81.6 ± 39.3, 82.9 ± 44.0 and 62.3 ± 32.0μg m³, respectively. However, MDE, SAO and SUL experienced low PM2.5 levels of 23 ± 13.7, 25.6 ± 11.7 and 22.4 ± 15.0 μg m³, respectively, and hence experienced negligible health burden of 0.07 (95% CI: 0.06–0.08), 0.1 (95% CI: 0.09–0.12) and 0.02 (95% CI: 0.02–0.03) deaths per 100,000 of the car commuting population per year, respectively.
• The economic losses related to the health burden caused by PM2.5 car exposure was measured against GDP per capita showing that lower GDP is associated with higher economic losses caused by in-car PM2.5 exposure for most cities, increasing to 8.9 and 10.2 million US$ per year for CAI and DAR, respectively. This indicates a socioeconomic discrepancy where air pollution and its health and economic costs are more felt in developing countries. However, CAN and SAO incurs the highest economic losses of 21.8 and 14 million US$ per year due to high VSL for these countries.
• Clear correlation showing increases in health burden and economic losses were observed with hotspot parameters highlighting the positive impact that would be achieved if hotspots were tackled as major problem areas within an urban environment.

An assessment of in-car PM2.5 health burden, economic cost and potential inhaled doses at hotspots have been estimated for ten cities. Similar studies in different modes of transport such as trains and buses considering gaseous pollutants are recommended to build a similar database for a more holistic assessment of the impact of transport emissions. This work would be further enhanced if other factors that contribute to transport costs are taken into consideration and assessed for their effectiveness as pollution mitigation measures. Further, the methodology adopted to calculate health burden and economic loss would be more accurate if city-specific information was available. This includes disease response parameters that are directly linked to PM2.5 as well as economic metrics that would more thoroughly assess the cost of morbidity associated with PM2.5 in addition to mortality. Temporal variations introduced by 24-hr exposure–response coefficients used for this study can be more thoroughly addressed, which was not feasible in this work given the limitations posed by the data availability and complexity. Hence, health burden and economic losses results should be considered as indicative estimates and interpreted cautiously. Overall, this work has provided a preliminary basis for better employing short-term air pollution exposure data to set the ground for more detailed analysis in cities elsewhere.

Table 6
HB indicates the absolute number of deaths within the car commuting population owing to hourly exposure to high PM2.5 levels under windows-open setting during MP, OP, EP and the sum of all three-time segments resulting from all commutes within one year. Numbers are represented as averages with a CI of 95% of (lower–upper). The corresponding annual EL are listed based on the total absolute number of deaths. HB is also listed for the recirculation setting based on data in Table S5. The total HB for windows-open is calculated per 100,000 people of the car commuting population to be compared with the deaths per 100,000 in 2019 reported by GBD resulting from ambient PM pollution.
