# Breast cancer risk in relation to ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter: results of a population-based case-control study corrected for potential selection bias (the CECILE study)

## A R T I C L E I N F O

**Handling Editor:** Prof. Zorana Andersen

**Background:** There is only scant evidence that air pollution increases the risk of breast cancer.

**Objectives:** We investigated this relationship for three air pollutants: nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamical diameter below 10 μm (PM10) and 2.5 μm (PM2.5).

**Methods:** We conducted a population-based case-control study on breast cancer in two French départements, including 1,229 women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005–2007 and 1,316 control women frequency-matched on age. Concentrations of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 at participants’ addresses occupied during the last 10 years were assessed using a chemistry transport model. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models where each woman was assigned a weight depending on her probability of selection into the study.

**Results:** The OR for breast cancer per 10-μg/m3 increase in NO2 was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.98, 1.26), and 1.41 (95% CI 1.07, 1.86) in the highest exposure quintile (Q5), compared to the first. The ORs per 10-μg/m3 NO2 did not markedly differ between pre- (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.89, 1.35) and post-menopausal women (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.97, 1.33), but the OR was substantially higher for hormone-receptor positive (ER+/PR+) breast tumor subtypes (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00, 1.31) than for ER–/PR– tumors (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72, 1.26). Breast cancer risk was not associated with either PM10 (OR per 1 μg/m3 1.01, 95% CI, 0.96, 1.06) or PM2.5 (OR per 1 μg/m3 1.02, 95% CI 0.95, 1.08), regardless of the menopausal status or of the breast tumor subtype.

**Discussion:** Our study provides evidence that NO2 exposure, a marker of traffic-related air pollutants, may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly ER+/PR+ tumors.

## 1. Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases annually. Unlike hormonal, reproductive or lifestyle–related risk factors, the role of environmental exposures such as air pollution in relation to breast cancer risk has remained inconclusive. Air pollution was classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a human carcinogen, based mostly on studies showing an association with lung cancer. However, air pollution contains a mixture of many compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals, and benzene, that may act as carcinogens or endocrine disruptors relevant for breast carcinogenesis. Since the mid-1990s, several cohort or case-control studies on breast cancer and exposure to various components of air pollution, especially nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5 or PM10), have been conducted in Europe, North America, and South-Korea. C. Lemarchand et al.

Although positive associations between exposure to air pollutants and breast cancer were inconsistently reported, most studies have focused on air pollution measured over a relatively short period of time before diagnosis, others were based on relatively small numbers, had very limited adjustment for potential confounders, or used confounders measured at ecological level. Because of these limitations, there remains great uncertainty about the existence of a causal link between air pollution and breast cancer.

Breast cancer is a molecularly diverse disease, that includes distinct molecular subtypes characterized by the expression of the estrogen (ER) or progesterone (PR) hormone receptors, and expression of proliferative markers such as Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2). The subtypes defined by the combinations of tumor receptors vary in prognosis and response to treatment, but they may also reflect distinct etiologic pathways that appear to be fixed at the time of tumor initiation. The association of air pollution with specific breast cancer subtypes may be indicative of specific etiological pathways, but only a few studies on breast cancer in relation to air pollution have examined etiological heterogeneity by breast cancer subtype, and results have been conflicting. Further data examining these associations are thus needed.

Studies have also suggested that the increase in risk of breast cancer was stronger in pre-menopausal than in post-menopausal women, but whether or not air pollution affects breast cancer risk differently according to menopausal status is debated and requires clarification.

In this article, we investigated the association between air pollution and breast cancer risk and examined whether the risk differed by menopausal status and tumor subtype. Using data from a population-based case-control study in France, we estimated the level of air pollution in the 10 years preceding diagnosis, and paid particular attention to possible selection biases inherent in this type of study.

## 2. Material and methods

### 2.1. Study population

We conducted a population-based case-control study in Ille-et-Vilaine and Côte d’Or, two French départements (administrative areas) located in the Western and Eastern part of France, respectively. Cases were women residing in these areas, aged 25–75 years, and diagnosed with a histologically confirmed in situ or invasive breast cancer between 2005 and 2007. In Ille-et-Vilaine, incident cases of breast cancer were recruited in the main local cancer hospital (Centre Eugène Marquis) as well as in local public and private hospitals treating breast cancer patients, with the aim to recruit in the study all breast cancer cases diagnosed during the study period among women in the département. This is in contrast with Côte d’Or where cases were exclusively recruited in the main local cancer hospital (Centre Georges-François Leclerc) that recruit most, but not all, breast cancer patients in this area. Information on ER, PR and HER2 status was obtained from the pathology reports. Of the 1,553 eligible cases identified during the study period, 163 refused to participate, 151 could not be contacted, and seven died before the interview. Finally, 1,232 (79%) incident breast cancer cases were included in the study.

To form the control group, we contacted by phone a random sample of private homes in the study areas and invited resident women with no history of breast cancer to participate. Women who agreed to participate were frequency-matched to the cases by 10-year age group and were re-contacted by a research nurse at their home address for an in-person interview. To account for possible differential participation rate of the controls across categories of socio-economic status (SES), we used quotas by SES to obtain a distribution by SES similar to that of the general female population in each study area. Among the 1,731 controls identified by phone fulfilling eligibility criteria for age and SES, 260 declined participation and 154 could not be re-contacted for the in-person interview, leaving 1,317 controls available for the study (participation 76%).

### 2.2. Data collection and data coding

A structured questionnaire was completed by a trained interviewer during an in-person interview with the cases and the controls. We elicited information on demographic and sociodemographic characteristics, reproductive history, family history of cancer, hormonal treatments, lifestyle, occupational history, and residential history over the lifetime.

### 2.3. Assessment of exposure to air pollutants

Exposure to air pollution at the women’s home address was assessed over the 10 years prior to a reference date, set at the date of diagnosis for the cases and at a concomitant date for frequency-matched controls. The reference date for the controls was chosen in accordance with incidence density sampling principles, which require selecting controls at each occurrence of a case. To account for the delay between case diagnosis and control interview during recruitment of study subjects, the controls reference date was set by moving the date of interview to the nearest earlier date of a case diagnosis. Only exposures that occurred prior to a woman’s reference date were included in the analysis, so that air pollution was assessed during the same 10-year time period in cases and in controls.

During the 10-year period before reference date, 5,489 home addresses were occupied by the cases and the controls. Each home address was geocoded using the street network database BD Adresse® (Institut Géographique National, IGN, Saint Mandé, France), which includes 26 million addresses in metropolitan France. Women with one or more missing addresses and those who lived at any time outside metropolitan France during the last 10 years were excluded from the analysis (31 cases and 25 controls), leaving 1,201 breast cancer cases and 1,292 controls in the analyses.

NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at each home address were obtained during the corresponding period of occupancy using the nationwide Gazel-Air model. This model provides annual estimates of each pollutant from 1989 to 2008 at a 2-km resolution scale in France. It is based on the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model, which provides pollutants concentrations at a 10-km resolution in France. To improve the spatial resolution from 10 to 2 km, a mesh refinement was performed using topography, land use, and road traffic data, that accounts for concentrations gradients around emission sources and variability of sources in a given mesh. Data assimilation and geostatistical analyses were also used to improve the accuracy of pollutants concentrations using local measurements. The mean of the annual concentrations of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 over the 10-year period before the reference date of each woman was calculated to serve as the main exposure metric in the analyses.

### 2.4. Correction for possible selection bias assigning weights to cases and controls

Any difference between cases and controls in the probability of inclusion in the study based on their place of residence at the time of recruitment, particularly whether they lived in an urban or rural area, could lead to a biased estimate of the association between air pollution and breast cancer risk. To avoid such bias, each woman was assigned a weight inversely proportional to her probability of participation in the study, based on her canton of residence during recruitment. The départements of Côte d’Or and Ille-et-Vilaine are subdivided in 18 and 20 C. Lemarchand et al.
Environment International 155 (2021) 106604

The weights were calculated for each departement and for the cases and controls separately, as the ratio between the proportion of women living in a given canton in the general population and the proportion of women living in that canton in the study sample. The weight assigned to a woman was thus greater than 1 if she lived in a canton that was under-represented in the study sample, and <1 if she lived in a canton that was over-represented. To assign weights to the cases in Cote d’Or, the distribution by canton of all incident breast cancer cases in the study period was made available from the local cancer registry. In Ille-et-Vilaine, where no cancer registry was available, incident breast cancer cases were actively searched in the medical records of all public hospitals and private clinics treating breast cancer patients, leading to a high inclusion rate of incident breast cancer patients into the study. Because the probability of recruitment of the cases was unlikely to vary greatly by canton of residence in Ille-et-Vilaine, a weight of 1 was assigned to all cases in this area. To assign weights to the controls in both Ille-et-Vilaine and Cote d’Or, we used the distribution by age and canton of the general female population in 2010, available from the Population Census.

2.5. Statistical analysis

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for breast cancer associated with 10-year mean annual exposures to NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 were estimated from unconditional logistic regression models, using the woman-specific weights as mentioned above. Exposure to each pollutant was categorized using quintiles of exposure among controls as cut-offs and trend tests were performed by fitting models where the median value of each quintile was introduced as a quantitative variable. We also expressed exposure as a continuous variable in multivariate models and estimated odds ratios for each increment of 10 μg/m3 for NO2 and 1 μg/m3 for PM10 and PM2.5, consistent with the interquartile ranges of pollutant levels among controls. ORs were adjusted for the matching variables (i.e., age (continuous) and study area (Cote d’Or, Ille-et-Vilaine)). Models were further adjusted for potential confounders selected among established breast cancer risk factors using stepwise logistic regression models to avoid collinearity between variables (history of breast cancer in first degree relatives, parity, age at first full-term pregnancy, current use of hormone replacement therapy and physical activity). Stratified analyses according to menopausal status were also conducted, and interactions were tested using likelihood ratio tests comparing models with and without an interaction term. To analyze possible differences by tumor subtype, we conducted multinomial logistic regressions by dichotomizing breast cancers as hormone positive (ER+ or PR+) or hormone negative (ER- and PR-) tumors. These subtypes were further subdivided according to HER2 status (HER2+ or HER2-), which was however missing in 214 cases (17%).

Sensitivity analyses using alternative methods to control for potential selection bias by place of residence were also conducted from logistic regression models using no weight but adjusting for urbanization level of the place residence at recruitment. Urbanization level was defined in four classes (main city center, suburb, medium-sized town, rural area).

3. Results

The distribution of breast cancer risk factors among cases and controls are presented in Table 1. As expected, the distributions by age and study area (the matching variables) were similar in the two groups. Cases had more often than controls a family history of breast cancer, had later age at first child birth, earlier age at menarche, lower parity, were more often current users of hormone replacement therapy and were more often physically inactive. The mean and median concentrations of air pollutants during the last 10 years are presented in Table 2. NO2 concentrations were higher in Table 1

Cˆote d’Or than in Ille-et-Vilaine were higher in the main cities than in rural areas in both departements. Overall, exposure to NO2 was slightly higher among cases (17.2 μg/m3) than controls (16.8 μg/m3) and in the two study areas, and did not change noticeably with urbanization level. Spearman correlation coefficients were 0.74 between NO2 and PM2.5 exposures, 0.21 between NO2 and PM10, and 0.38 between PM10 and PM2.5. The odds ratios associated with NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are presented in Table 3. Odds ratios were adjusted for the matching variables only (age and d´epartement) in Model 1, and further adjusted for selected breast cancer risk factors in Model 2. The odds ratios decreased only slightly in Model 2. In this model, the odds ratio for breast cancer in the highest NO2 quintile vs the lowest was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.07, 1.86) (p trend 0.04), and the odds ratio per 10-μg/m3 increment of NO2 was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.98, 1.26). For PM10, the odds ratio in the highest exposure quintile was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.93, 1.55) and the odds ratio per 1-μg/m3 exposure increment was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.96, 1.06). For PM2.5 the corresponding odds ratios were 1.00 (95% CI, 0.77, 1.31) and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.95, 1.08), respectively. In Table 4 the odds ratios are shown for pre- and post-menopausal women separately. The odds ratio per 10-μg/m3 increment of NO2 was slightly higher in post-menopausal (1.14; 95% CI, 0.97, 1.33), than in pre-menopausal women (1.09; 95% CI, 0.89, 1.35) (interaction p-value 0.46). No association of PM10 or PM2.5 exposure levels with breast cancer was apparent in either pre- or post-menopausal women. Table 5 shows the odds ratios for specific breast cancer subtypes defined as either hormone receptor positive (ER+ or PR+) or hormone receptor negative (ER– and PR–). Odds ratios associated with NO2 were increased for ER+/PR+ tumors (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00, 1.31), particularly in post-menopausal women (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01, 1.42), but not Table 3

We found that exposure to NO2 in the last 10-year period before diagnosis was associated with increased incidence of breast cancer. Although the association was slightly higher in post-menopausal than in premenopausal women, the evidence that the risk differed by menopausal status was weak. However, we found that exposure to NO2 was associated with an increased risk of hormone-dependent breast tumors (ER+/PR+), while no association was seen with tumors that were negative for both ER and PR. There was no evidence of an association between exposure to PM10 or PM2.5 and breast cancer risk.

4.1. Nitrogen oxides
A major source of NOx/NO2 in air is fossil fuel combustion arising from power generation plants and heat-engine vehicle traffic. As such, NOx and NO2 are considered as good road traffic tracers. Although the intrinsic carcinogenicity of NO2 is still unclear, it may represent a marker of exposure to mixtures of components with hormonal or carcinogenic properties, such as PAHs, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), benzene, metals and other chemicals, some of these possibly acting on breast tissue.

Breast cancer in relation to NO2 was investigated in case-control studies, all of them from Canada, and in cohort studies. In the case-control studies, exposure to NO2 was estimated from Land Use Regression (LUR) modeling at the time of diagnosis or during the preceding 20-year period. In the later study, NO2 was also assessed using satellite-derived observations and historical fixed-site measurements. The odds ratios for breast cancer were 1.33 in Crouse et al., 1.07 in Goldberg et al., and 1.04 in Hystad et al. per increase of 10 μg/m3. These results are in line with our estimated odds ratio of 1.11 estimated over the 10-year period before diagnosis.

Cohort studies assessed NO2 exposure using LUR modeling and reported mixed findings. In the ESCAPE study on post-menopausal women recruited in 15 cohort studies in 9 European countries, the hazard ratios were 1.02 per 10-μg/m3 increase of NO2, and 1.04 per 20-μg/m3 increase of NOx. No significant association was observed between NO2 and breast cancer risk in cohort studies from Denmark and in the Multiethnic cohort. However, NO2 was associated with breast cancer in the Sister Study cohort and with pre-menopausal breast cancer in the Canadian National Breast Screening Study. Among studies based on population-registers of cancer incidence, a positive association of NO2 with breast cancer incidence was reported in the nationwide ecological study in South-Korea, and in study based on health care register databases from Saxony, Germany but not from Ontario, Canada.

Overall, the findings from cohort or case-control studies, including our own, are suggestive of an association between NO2 exposure and breast cancer. Exposure to NO2 can be seen as a proxy for exposure to traffic-related air pollutants and may not be a direct cause of breast cancer. Additional evidence for a role of traffic-related air pollution is provided by studies showing that breast cancer risk increases with proximity to roadways and traffic volume. Further studies are needed to identify the pollutants emitted by car traffic or their mixtures that could explain the Table 4

4.2. Particulate matter

PM may be anthropogenic (particularly diesel-engine vehicles), industry, agriculture, or may be of natural origin. As a mixture, carcinogenic chemicals such as benzo[a] pyrene (B[a]P) and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can also bind to PM. Particulate matter was classified as carcinogenic by IARC, based on epidemiological studies showing a consistent association with lung cancer risk. To our knowledge, breast cancer risk in relation to PM exposure was investigated only in cohort studies, based on LUR modeling, kriging, dispersion modeling, or satellite-based estimates. In the ESCAPE project, a modest non-significant increase of breast cancer incidence was observed for PM2.5 (HR 1.08, 95% CI, 0.77, 1.51 per 5-μg/m3 increase) and PM10 (HR 1.07, 95% CI, 0.89, 1.30 per 10-μg/m3 increase). In the Multiethnic cohort study, breast cancer was positively associated with PM10 and PM2.5, particularly in women living within 500 m of major roads. The South-Korean study reported an odds ratio of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.09, 1.17) per 10-μg/m3 PM10, but consideration of covariates at the ecological level was a strong limitation in this study. PM10 and PM2.5 were not found to be associated with breast cancer in other cohort studies.

Unlike NO2, only weak and inconsistent increases in breast cancer risk associated with PM were reported in the literature. This could be explained by the low spatial variability of PM that strongly limits its potential as a proxy for assessing causal exposure and hence that does not make it a sensitive marker for identifying chronic effects. Because only certain specific components of PM may be responsible for an increase in breast cancer incidence, the inconsistent findings may be explained by the variable composition of PM between studies. In the US nationwide Sister Study, breast cancer risk varied according to geographic location in the US and clusters defined by PM2.5 composition. In the ESCAPE project, the analysis of the elemental composition of PM showed that the nickel and vanadium components of both PM10 and PM2.5 were associated with increased breast cancer risk. Further investigation is thus warranted to investigate in more details the role of PM components in breast cancer incidence.

### Menopausal status

In our study, the association between NO2 and breast cancer was slightly higher in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women, but the difference was very small (interaction p-value, 0.46). While some studies reported no increased risk associated with NO2 in either group, a few others reported an association with breast cancer in premenopausal women. Exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with higher breast cancer risk in pre- than in post-menopausal women, but the findings have been inconsistent. Whether air pollution affects breast cancer risk differently according to menopausal status remains unclear and requires further scrutiny.

### Hormone receptor status and plausible biological mechanisms

We found that NO2 increased the risk of hormone-dependent ER+/PR+ breast tumors, but not ER-/PR- tumors. To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the relationship between air pollutants and breast cancer subtypes defined by the HER2 receptor status, but the existence of a specific risk profile in relation to HER2 expression was not found. Because the breast cancer tumor subtype seems to be determined at the time of tumor initiation, the receptor status of the breast tumor might reflect the etiologic pathway that led from exposure to cancer development. The finding of an association with hormone-dependent tumors in our study is in line with previous studies reporting an association between NOx/NO2 and ER+/PR+ breast cancer subtypes, suggesting that traffic-related air pollutants associated with NO2 might act as mammary carcinogens through hormonal mechanisms. Besides, ER-/PR- breast tumors have been associated with exposure to benzene, traffic-related benzo(a)pyrene, or long-term low-dose exposure to ambient cadmium compounds, suggesting that some pollutants may also affect breast cancer risk through non-hormonal mechanisms.

Although the precise mechanism by which air pollutants may affect breast cancer incidence are not known, exposure to PAHs represents a possible cause of mammary carcinogenesis. PAHs are present in ambient air and are lipophilic compounds that accumulate in breast tissue. They have estrogenic or anti-estrogenic properties and induce mammary tumors in animal studies. They are also genotoxic and cause DNA damage through the formation of PAH-DNA adducts. An increase in breast cancer risk has been associated with traffic-related benzo[a]pyrene used as a proxy of traffic-related PAHs, particularly among women with selected biologically plausible DNA repair genotypes. It is also possible that traffic-related air pollutants lead to high risk of breast cancer through DNA-methylation processes. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that global hypomethylation was associated with NOx and NO2 and that high epigenome-wide DNA methylation in pre-diagnostic blood samples was associated with lower risk of breast cancer.

### Invasive vs in situ breast tumors

Exposure to air pollutants was not associated with in situ breast tumors in our data. The odds ratios were close to 1 with wide confidence intervals and did not significantly differ from those for invasive tumors. Our results do not confirm the findings of the Sister Study cohort that reported associations of NO2 and PM2.5 with ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) but not with invasive tumors. In the Long Island Breast Cancer Study, exposure to traffic-related B[a]P was also stronger for in situ carcinomas than for invasive tumors. The higher risk for DCIS in these studies remains unexplained and deserves further investigations.

### Study strengths and weaknesses

Inherent to case-control studies is the potential for bias in the selection of cases and controls. This is of particular concern when the exposure of interest is strongly related to the place of residence or time, as is the case for atmospheric pollutants. To our knowledge, most former case-control studies relating atmospheric pollutants and breast cancer did not explicitly consider this issue. In our study, we were able to accurately control for a potential selection bias arising from differential recruitment probability of cases and controls with respect to their residential location within the departement, by assigning a weight to each subject depending on the residence in one of the 18 cantons in Côte d’Or and 20 cantons in Ille-et-Vilaine. When using this weight, we considered the fact that the cases and the controls were more or less willing to participate depending on the urban or rural status of their area of residence. For cases, we were only able to calculate these weights in the Côte d’Or area, where a cancer registry exists, but not in Ille-et-Vilaine. In this area, however, incident cases were actively sought in all medical departments treating breast cancer patients with close involvement of the oncologists. We applied a weight of 1 to all cases in Ille-et-Vilaine, because the high inclusion rate of incident cases was likely to prevent substantial variations in recruitment probabilities between cantons.

The availability of detailed data on established breast cancer risk factors and other potential confounders, on hormonal receptors status of the cases’ tumor as well as on lifetime residential history in 2,500 French women constitute other strengths of our study. Regarding exposure characterization to air pollutants, we used the Gazel-Air model, which provides annual averages of air pollutant levels in France from 1989 to 2008 at a scale of 2 km. We were thus able to assess exposure over a 10-year period prior to the date of cancer diagnosis, avoiding biased estimations related to particular conditions of air pollution for a given year and accounted for all residential changes during that period. A limitation of our study is that we were not able to assess air pollution in early life periods, which may be another etiologically relevant period. Although the adult period remains a relevant time period to study, previous investigations also reported associations between breast cancer risk and exposure to air pollutants or vehicular traffic-related air pollution at birth, during childhood, or adolescence. Another limitation of the study includes the lack of time-activity pattern information, that did not allow us to consider exposure to air pollutants at work and in transport.

## Conclusion

Our results indicate that exposure to NO2, a marker of motor-vehicle traffic pollution, may increase the risk of breast cancer. The stronger association with hormone receptor-positive breast tumors suggests a role in disease etiology of specific airborne pollutants with hormonal effects. These results confirm the importance of reducing air pollution, especially those related to road traffic emissions.
