Over the course of the continual phase-outs of toxic halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), there has been an increasing demand for organophosphate esters (OPEs) in global FR markets. OPE-FRs have largely been identified as OP triesters, which have a basic chemical structure of O = P(OR)3. In addition to OP triesters, OPEs can refer to another class of related substances, namely, OP diesters that have a typical chemical structure of O = P(OR)2(OH)). OP diesters are known as biotic or abiotic degradation products of OP triesters. In recent years, environmental scientists have proven that OP diesters widely exist in a variety of environmental matrices and biotic samples around the world, implying the potential risks from OP diester exposure to biota and humans in the environment. Here, we have reviewed the scientific literature for studies involving OP diesters and up to the end of 2020. The aim of the present review is to assess the present understanding of the physicochemical properties, sources (industrial production and degradation), environmental occurrence of OP diesters, and adverse effects to exposed organisms. Based on the literature in the Web of Science core collection, we found that at least 23 OP diesters have been reported as contaminants in various environments or as degradation products of OP triesters. The physicochemical properties of OP diesters vary depending on their specific chemical structures. OP diesters containing halogen atoms and aryl groups seem to be more persistent (with greater estimated half-life (t1/2) values) in environmental matrices. There were multiple sources of OP diesters, including industrial production and biotic or abiotic degradation from OP triesters. Specifically, we found that ten OP diesters are

In addition, the wide application of OP triesters worldwide makes the degradation of OP triesters another critical source of OP diesters to the environment and to organisms. Current monitoring studies have demonstrated that some OP diesters were detectable in the human body (via both blood and urine samples), indoor dust, wastewater, or sewage sludge worldwide. The highest concentrations of diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) in human urine have been reported as high as 727 ng/mL (children (aged 0–5 years) urine samples from Australia). In addition, adverse effects following direct or indirect exposure to 11 OP diesters in organisms (including animals, bacteria, and algae) have been reported, and the recorded adverse outcomes following exposure to OP diesters included developmental toxicity, alteration of gene expression, and disturbance of nuclear receptor activity. Biomonitoring studies regarding human samples have frequently reported statistically significant associations between the concentrations of OP diesters and markers of human health (mainly related to reproductive toxicity). Finally, on the basis of current knowledge on OP diesters, we propose prospects for related research directions in future studies.

# 1. Introduction

Flame retardants (FRs) are chemical substances that are added to manufactured materials, i.e., plastics and textiles to prevent or delay the ignition and spread of fire. In 2007, the total FR market in Asia, Europe and the United States was approximately 1.8 million metric tons, and it was estimated that global FR consumption would reach 2.8 million tons in 2018. In recent decades, several classes of halogenated (H) FRs, i.e., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), have been gradually eliminated from the world market due to their persistence, long-range atmospheric transport, bioaccumulation, and toxicological effects when exposed to animals or humans. The phasing-out of HFRs, including those with proven toxicities, has led to increasing market demands for alternative FRs, which have included organophosphate (OP) triesters. Thus, the global consumption of OP triesters was 500,000 tons in 2011, and this number increased to 680,000 tons in 2015. Given the large production and consumption of OP triesters, there is increasing research interest in their environmental occurrence, fate, and toxicity in the field of environmental science. OP esters (E) refer to OP triesters as well as OP diesters, for which one of the alkyl ester groups of an OP triester is replaced by a hydroxyl group. Therefore, all OP diesters are phosphoric acids. Over the last decade, OP diesters have been frequently reported as degradation products or metabolites of OP triesters. In addition, some studies have mentioned that several OP diesters could also have industrial production sources and applications. Recently, there has been an increasing number of reports on the occurrence of OP diesters in environmental samples or human samples collected from the United States, China, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Belgium. An increasing number of publications have also reported adverse effects in OP diester-exposed organisms. However, current knowledge regarding OP diesters is found in hundreds of research articles and to our knowledge, there is currently no review on OP diesters in the environmental context. The present review examines all OP diesters that have been reported in the Web of Science core collection from the year 1970 to the end of 2020. The primary objectives of the present review are 1) to summarize all OP diesters that have been reported and to analyze their potential characteristics in environments; 2) to characterize their potential sources, i.e., industrial production and biotic and abiotic degradation from OP triesters; 3) to summarize the occurrence and distribution of OP diesters in different environmental and biological matrices; and 4) to discuss the current knowledge regarding the adverse effects from OP diesters in exposed animals or humans. Finally, we discuss the current knowledge gaps in the research on OP diesters and recommend the critical directions for future environmental research on OP diesters.

# 2. OP diester studies in the scientific literature

By searching the Web of Science core collection with the keyword organophosphate diesters, we obtained the first batch of existing information on all available scientifically peer-reviewed OP diester studies. A further search was performed with more details on the specific names (e.g., diphenyl phosphate (full name for DPHP)) of OP diesters as keywords. By using this strategy, we listed all potential OP diesters that have been reported up to the end of 2020. The list of OP diesters is summarized in Table S1, which includes their chemical structures, CAS numbers, full names, and abbreviations. The OP diesters in this list can be generally divided into three categories according to the composition and structures of their branched chain (R1 and R2), namely, nonhalogenated alkanes, aryl groups, or halogenated alkanes (Cl or Br).

# 3. Estimation of physicochemical properties of OP diesters via the USEPA EPI Suite

By estimating the physicochemical properties of OP diesters, we can reasonably predict their potential behaviors in the environment and then provide a basis for the assessment of the risk of exposure to OP diesters. The estimation of physicochemical properties of OP diesters is required currently, because there are no empirical data available. Using USEPA EPI Suite software, we predicted the Henry’s law constants, solubilities, vapor pressures, octanol–water partition coefficients, and bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for all OP diesters, and the information is summarized in Table 1. We sorted the OP diesters from lower to higher molecular weight. We observed that the estimated physicochemical properties of different categories of OP diesters are very different, and the estimated physicochemical properties of these diesters have statistically significant correlations with their molecular masses and chemical structures by using linear regression. Specifically, the R2 values between estimated log Kow and molecular weight of different categories of OP diesters were greater than 0.8 (linear and branched groups: R2 = 0.9995; 2 phenyl groups: R2 = 0.9759; Cl- or Br-containing groups: R2 = 0.8327). The USEPA EPI Suite is generally used to predict the physicochemical properties of compounds (usually neutral compounds) based on various mathematical models, while OP diesters contain phosphoric acid functional groups. Therefore, the prediction of physicochemical properties of OP diesters must also consider their acidic structure and properties. The actual physicochemical properties of OP diesters need further empirical analysis and verification. Under neutral conditions, the estimated water solubility values of OP diesters range from 1.09 × 10^6 mg/L (bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate) to 3.4710^6 mg/L (dimethyl phosphate, DMP). DMP and diethyl phosphate (DEP) are highly soluble in water, while Y. Liu et al.

B2,4DtBPP and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (BEHP) are almost insoluble in water. For OP diesters with similar molecular weights, the diesters containing halogen atoms (such as Cl and Br) in the branched structure are more water soluble, while the estimated water solubility of remaining OP diesters have medium to low saturated vapor pressures, indicating that these OP diesters have low volatility at room temperature. An exception is bis(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (BBOEP) containing two ether bonds, which greatly enhances water solubility. In summary, if the abovementioned OP diesters have the same hydrolysis half-lives, OP diesters with smaller molecular weights and containing special structures (halogen atoms or ether bonds) are theoretically more likely to be found in aquatic environments. The above rules can also be derived from the distribution characteristics of the estimated log KOW values. In addition, because all OP diesters have a phosphoric acid backbone structure, they undergo hydrolysis under alkaline conditions and are largely in their conjugate base form in aqueous solutions, thereby increasing their solubility.

Except for DMP, the abovementioned OP diesters have positive estimated log KOW values, indicating that most of them are lipophilic substances and have the potential for bioconcentration and bioaccumulation. The estimated log KOW values of OP diesters range from 0.66 (DMP) to 10.52 (B2,4DtBPP), which generally increases with decreasing water solubility. That is, OP diesters that do not contain halogen atoms and have a larger molecular weight (such as B2,4DtBPP, BEHP, etc.) are more hydrophobic. Given that BBOEP contains two ether bonds, the log KOW values of BBOEP are relatively low. Again, given that OP diesters contain a single phosphoric acid functional group, their Log KOW values could decrease under alkaline conditions.

The estimated Henry’s law constant at 25 ◦C of all OP diesters ranges from 4.27 × 10 13 atm-m3/mole (bis(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate, BDBPP) to 4.11 × 10 8 atm-m3/mole (BEHP). The range of estimated Henry’s law constants is relatively small, strongly indicating that the distribution of different OP diesters between air and environmental water could be similar. The estimated Henry’s law constants of all OP diesters mentioned above are low; therefore, the tendency to volatilize by partitioning from the water to air phases is small, indicating that OP diesters are more prone to exist in the water environment.

The estimated vapor pressures and estimated BCFs of OP diesters are largely different. Their estimated vapor pressure values at 25 ℃ range from 1.78 × 10 10 mmHg (B2,4DtBPP) to 0.34 mmHg (DMP). Among

Specific industrial applications of the ten OP diesters are shown in Table 2. OP diesters are generally used as FRs or plasticizers. Specifically, DMP, DPHP, DiBP, BDBPP, and DoCP were registered to be used as FRs; whereas DnBP, BEHP, DPHP, DiBP, and DoCP can be used as plasticizers. BDBPP is primarily used as an FR additive in plastics and textiles. Additionally, DMP, DEP, DPHP, and DBzP are utilized as intermediates of pesticides, medicines, or organic materials. DnBP, DiBP, and B2,4DtBPP are also used as organic synthetic materials in industry, while BEHP is utilized as a wetting agent and a surfactant raw material. Some OP diesters are also used as industrial extractants and catalysts. For instance, DnBP is used as an extractant for uranium and thorium and as a separating agent for lanthanides. DEP is utilized as an extractant and polymerization catalyst. BEHP is used as an extractant for uranium and beryllium. In addition to the aforementioned uses, DnBP, DEP, and BEHP are also used as solvents, while DMP is used in polymerization as a crosslinking agent. DnBP is approved for use in gas chromatography as a gas chromatographic fixative. Existing information indicates that some OP diesters have industrial sources and applications, which are often not mentioned in studies in the published literature. In the future, the industrial sources and applications of OP diesters need to be further elucidated and studied.

4.2. OP diesters as products of biological degradation of commercial OP triesters
According to the literature, OP diesters could also be sourced from the biodegradation of OP triesters, and all biodegradation sources are summarized in Table S4. The biodegradation of OP triesters to OP diesters can be categorized based on humans, animals, plants, and

![Estimated water solubilities (mg/L; left plot) and log Kow values (right plot) versus molecular mass of OP diesters, which are identified by groups depending on their different functional groups.](image_link) bacteria. Among those studies, the animals include mice, fish (including zebrafish, freshwater fish, rare minnow and crucian carp), avian species (including herring gull, addled bald eagle eggs, and chicken), polar bears, ringed seals, and earthworms. Plants studied are mainly wheat, and bacteria include Sphingomonas and Brevibacillus brevis.
OP diester metabolism studies include both in vivo experiments and in vitro experiments. Among them, biological samples commonly used in in vitro degradation experiments related to humans and animals include liver microsomes, liver homogenate, liver cells, and liver S9 fractions. Hydroponic experiments are often the basis of studies in plants. The main source of microbial degradation of OP diesters is the strain in activated sludge, which are isolated from the environmental media exposed to OP triesters and can degrade OP triesters. The main reason for the rapid degradation of OP triesters by microorganisms is catalyzed by phosphohydrolases, which break the phosphate ester bonds one by one. For example, hydrolysis of the branched chain of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) is catalyzed by phosphotriesterase (PTE) to produce a molecule of 2-chloroethanol and a molecule of BCEP. In the early stage, the biodegradation of OP triesters was mainly studied by contact experiments with rodents such as mice. As early as 1970, researchers conducted metabolic experiments in mice (injection of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and triethyl phosphate (TEP)) and found that DMP and DEP are metabolites of OP triesters TMP and TEP, respectively. Subsequently, in the 1980 s, DPHP, di-para-cresyl phosphate (DpCP), BDCIPP, BDBPP, and other OP diesters were confirmed to be metabolites of the corresponding OP triesters through in vivo or in vitro experiments in mice. In addition, the current literature also demonstrates that TMP and TEP are metabolized to DMP and DEP in rats and mice, respectively, and could be excreted in urine; BDCIPP can be produced by the metabolism of the parent compound tris(1,3-dichloro-2propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) in rats, rat liver homogenate, human liver microsome and human liver S9 fractions; BCEP can be produced by the metabolism of TCEP through rats, human liver microsomes and human liver S9 fractions; DpCP can be produced by the metabolism of tri-para-cresyl phosphate (TpCP) by rats, etc. (The full names of all parent compounds are in Table S2).
In addition, with the increase in applicable in vivo and in vitro experimental methods, an increasing amount of attention is being given to the degradation of OP triesters in other organisms. For example, in 2013, van den Eede et al. confirmed that OP diesters such as BBOEP, DPHP, BCEP, BCIPP, and BDCIPP were the main products of Phase I metabolism of the corresponding OP triesters in the human body. DPHP can also be produced by the metabolism of a variety of parent OP triesters through chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEHs), wild herring gulls, and other organisms or biological tissue. DnBP, DiBP, BBOEP, DPHP, BCEP, BCIPP, and BDCIPP OP diesters have been confirmed to be one of the metabolites of OP triesters in wheat, and the major products from the parent triesters are diesters formed by direct dealkylation. Triesters selectively bind to TαGST4–4 and CYP71C6 V1 with different binding affinities, which demonstrated their susceptibility to metabolism and the formation of metabolite products in wheat. DnBP can be produced by OP triester (tributyl phosphate (TnBP)) metabolism in terrestrial invertebrate earthworms. In addition, it is worth noting that a newly discovered OPE (BEHPP, bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-phenyl phosphate, CAS# 16368–97-1) which is widely detected in indoor dust samples, surface soil samples and surface sediment samples may also be the potential metabolic parent of BEHP, but this needs to be verified by subsequent experiments.
Overall, since the phase-out of traditional BFRs like PBDEs, OP triesters have become mainstream FRs, which can be reflected by their increasing consumption, i.e., from 500,000 tons in 2011 to 680,000 tons in 2015 in the global market. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that OP diesters, i.e., BBOEP, DPHP, BCEP, BCIPP, and BDCIPP are primary metabolites of OP triesters via the metabolic pathway of dealkylation, implying that humans or organisms in the environment could serve as numerous converters from OP triesters to diesters. Taking all the above-mentioned information together, it is plausible to conclude that biodegradation of OP triesters is likely a very important source for OP diesters in the environment.

4.3. Products of abiotic degradation of OP triesters

The abiotic sources of OP diesters mainly include hydrolysis, photodegradation, and other specific chemical reactions from OP triesters. We found that there are very few studies on abiotic sources of OP diesters, and thus, a very limited number of OP diesters are described in the current literature.
A previous study stated that most OP triesters are stable in aqueous media at neutral pH and not easily hydrolyzed. The half-life of degradation is estimated to range from 1.2 to 5.5 years. Another study showed that the hydrolysis of OP triesters is pH-dependent and related to the specific chemical structures of OP triesters. This study set four individual pH values (7, 9, 11 and 13), and OP triesters were classified according to the structural characteristics of their side chain. OP triesters were divided into those with alkyl functional groups, chloroalkyl functional groups, aryl functional groups and others. By analyzing the stability, hydrolysis rate and hydrolysis products of these four groups of OP triesters in the four different pH solutions within 35 days at 20 ℃, it was found that in the above OP triesters, except for triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) and TpCP in the aryl group, which were hydrolyzed at pH 7, 9, and 11, most of the other OP triesters had no obvious degradation in the solution with pH 7, 9 and 11; or when pH was 13, except for TnBP and tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP). Other OP triesters showed different degrees of hydrolysis, where with increasingly basic pH the order of OP triester stability was alkyl side chain group > chloroalkyl side chain group > aryl side chain group. Tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) also undergo a higher degree of hydrolysis at pH = 13. In addition, this study also pointed out that OP diesters are the final products of the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of OP triesters. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that, except for DPHP, DpCP could be obtained from their parent OP triesters by abiotic hydrolysis in natural water environments, where other OP diesters are less likely to have abiotic hydrolytic sources. Further studies have also demonstrated that OP triesters can be hydrolyzed with the addition of catalysts or special compounds. For example, TpCP can be hydrolyzed with Fe(OH)3 and Ru(OH)3 as catalysts, and DpCP is one of the potential hydrolysis products. Some reports have confirmed that reducing sulfur compounds such as bisulfide (HS-) and thiophenolate (PhS-) existing in the hypoxic subregions of coastal waters can undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with TCEP and generate BCEP. The hydrolysis of organophosphorus substances can be described as two bond-breaking mechanisms: a. H2O attacking carbon atoms and b. OH— or H2O attacking phosphorus atoms.
OP diesters can also be generated by photodegradation of OP triesters. Related research has mainly focused on the remediation of environmental media that were polluted by OP triesters. Studies on the photodegradation of OP triesters were generally conducted using UV lamp irradiation, and several typical oxidants used were H2O2, TiO2, persulfate, and humic acid. The photodegradation of OP triesters requires the use of oxidants because some OPE side chain alkyl groups lack chromophores and have no absorption peaks; therefore, they cannot be directly photodegraded. Compounds can also be degraded by indirect photolysis mediated by excitation of dissolved organic substances in natural waters. Table 3

reviewed, only DMP, DEP, DnBP, BBOEP, DpCP, BCEP, and BCIPP have been confirmed to be the photodegradation products of OP triesters. In 2012, a study reported the photocatalytic degradation of TnBP using nanometer-scale β-Ga2O3. The 10 mg of photocatalyst and 0.5 mL of H2O2 can completely degrade tri-n-butyl phosphate (400 ppm TnBP in 1000 mL) in less than 40 min, but there has been no further study on whether the degradation product is the corresponding diester DnBP. However, in an early study, researchers reported that DnBP could be the primary photodegradation product of TnBP. In addition, some researchers have reported the use of hematite and goethite nanoparticles to degrade TMP and TEP under the action of simulated sunlight and found that TMP and TEP can be photodegraded. The first reaction is the replacement of methoxy and ethoxy groups to obtain the intermediate products DMP and DEP. Further photodegradation replaces other methoxy and ethoxy groups, and the adsorbed orthophosphate is the final reaction product. BBOEP can be formed by hydroxylation and further dealkylation of TBOEP under the catalysis of visible light reaction catalysts such as TiO2/V2O5. Some researchers have studied the kinetics and reaction mechanism of tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) photocatalytic degradation. Under simulated natural light conditions, TCIPP can be degraded into BCIPP in ultrapure water with added TiO2, and the photogenerated OH radicals on the surface of the catalyst are the main oxidants. Hydroxylation, oxidation, dichlorination, and dealkylation are the main photocatalytic conversion pathways. Under simulated sunlight conditions, the presence of NO2 and Fe3+ can promote the photochemical degradation of TpCP, while humic acid has a negative effect on the photodegradation of TpCP, and DpCP was preliminarily identified as one of its photolysis products by HPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS analysis. OP diesters can also be produced through other abiotic pathways of OP triesters. For example, TMP binds firmly to the surface of α-Fe2O3, and the methoxy group is replaced by anion sites on the surface to generate adsorbed DMP and methoxy groups. DnBP was identified as the main byproduct in the process of using gliding arc plasma to treat spent TnBP.

5. Occurrence of OP diesters in environments, organisms, and humans

By summarizing the industrial and degradation sources of OP diesters, it is found that most OP diesters can be derived from the biodegradation of OP triesters that are commonly used as FRs or plasticizers. In addition, some OP diesters have industrial sources; that is, some OP diesters can be added to a variety of commercial products, such as FRs and plasticizers. OPs are added to the final product in a non-chemically bonded manner. Therefore, OP diesters can enter various environmental media through multiple sources, thereby increasing the risk of biological exposure. At present, some OP diesters have been detected to varying degrees in humans (blood and urine), indoor dust, various environmental water bodies (wastewater, rivers, etc.), and wastewater sludge from all over the world. In addition, we summarize the detection frequency (DF) and concentration range of OP diesters in various media around the world. At present, at least 15 OP diesters were detected in human urine, followed by indoor dust (12 OP diesters) and sewage sludge (11 OP diesters). Notably, seven OP diesters, i.e., DnBP, BEHP, BBOEP, DPHP, BCEP, BCIPP, and BDCIPP have been detected in a variety of environmental matrices. These OP diesters are the key OP diesters covered by most studies at present. OP diesters are rarely detected as independent target substances in environmental media, and related research has always focused on OP triesters. Information on the environmental occurrence of other OP diesters is very rare, and there is a lack of comprehensive research on the detection status of other OP diesters.

5.1. OP diesters in aqueous samples

The current reports of OP diester detection in aqueous samples mainly focus on wastewater and rivers. Specific OP diesters that were detected in wastewater mainly contained DEP, DnBP, DiBP, BEHP, DPHP, BCEP, BCIPP, and BDCIPP, and their sampling sites included the Pearl River Delta (China) and New York (United States).

were detected in rivers included DnBP, BEHP and DPHP.
The literature we reviewed shows that there are large differences in the DF among OP diesters in wastewater, and most OP diesters have a high DF. BEHP exhibited the highest concentration (61 μg/L) in the influent of a wastewater treatment plant in 2006. Specifically, researchers from Germany and Spain investigated the occurrence of OP diesters (DnBP, DPHP, BEHP and DiBP) in the influent and effluent of the aforementioned wastewater treatment plant. Among them, BEHP exhibited the highest contamination level, and its concentrations in influent and effluent were 61 μg/L and 4.7 μg/L, respectively. Due to the lack of pure reference materials, the concentrations of DiBP were not quantified, and the concentrations of DPHP and DnBP in the effluent were 0.05 μg/L and 0.027 μg/L, respectively. In 2017, Kim et al. analyzed two OP diesters (DPHP and BDCIPP) at the sewage treatment plant in Albany (New York, United States) and found that the above two diesters were detected at different frequencies in raw wastewater, primary-treated wastewater, and final effluent. Among them, the DF of DPHP in the effluent was as high as 94%, the highest concentration in raw wastewater was 1.29 μg/L, and the effluent concentrations of DPHP were as low as 0.025–0.458 μg/L. BDCIPP was detected in both influent and effluent, and its DF was 56%. The concentrations of BDCIPP in the influent and effluent were 1.83–4.55 μg/L and 1.76–4.1 μg/L, respectively. The DF of DPHP was higher than that of BDCIPP, but the concentration level in wastewater at three different stages was lower than that of BDCIPP. In 2019, Xu et al. reported OP diester levels in the influent and effluent of eight industrial wastewater treatment plants in the Pearl River Delta region of China, and the OP diesters involved were DEP, DnBP, BCEP, BCIPP, BDCIPP, DPHP, and BEHP. All seven OP diesters mentioned above were detectable in the influent and effluent, and the DF of DnBP, BCIPP, DPHP, and BEHP in the initial wastewater reached 100%. The DF of BDCIPP in the effluent was 100%; the maximum values of the influent and effluent concentrations of DnBP (3.033 μg/L and 0.509 μg/L, respectively) were greater than those of other diesters. The maximum detected concentrations of DnBP, BEHP, BCIPP, DPHP, BCEP, BDCIPP, and DEP in the initial wastewater decreased sequentially. The DF (influent: 25%; effluent: 12.5%) and detection concentration (the maximum concentration in influent: 3.8 ng/L; the maximum concentration in effluent: 1.6 ng/L) of DEP were lower than those of other OP diesters. In addition, the concentrations of some OP diesters (such as DnBP, DPHP, and BEHP) in influent and effluent were equal to or even higher than those of their respective parent OP triesters.

Detection data of OP diesters in natural water are relatively scarce. The literature shows that the concentration of OP diesters is low in unpolluted or low-polluted natural rivers. For example, in a study published in 2010 on the establishment of OP triester and diester detection methods, the researchers analyzed the concentrations of three OP diesters (DnBP, BEHP, and DPHP) in river samples collected in 2009. One river sample was collected in a river approximately 5 km downstream of the sewage treatment plant; the other three river samples came from three different rivers, which have no known municipal wastewater discharge, but two rivers flow through highly industrialized areas. DnBP, BEHP, and DPHP were all detected in the abovementioned river samples. In the river samples without urban wastewater discharge, the concentration of the three OP diesters was significantly lower than that of the other samples, and the highest concentration was 30 ± 1 ng/L (DnBP). The highest concentration of OP diester in river samples located 5 km downstream of the sewage treatment plant was 92 ± 9 ng/L (BEHP). However, due to the lack of data, it is impossible to compare and analyze the detection of OP diesters in natural water more comprehensively and accurately.

Via the USEPA EPI Suite, we evaluated the half-life values of OP diesters in water and sediment, and the half-life values of OP diesters in water ranged from 8.7 days (DnBP) to 180 days (B2,4DtBPP). Their estimated half-life values in sediment range from 78 days (DnBP) to 1621 days (B2,4DtBPP). The estimated half-lives of most OP diesters in water and sediment are greater than 37.5 days and 338 days, respectively. Most OP diesters are considered to meet persistent or very persistent criteria (half-life > 40 d and > 60 d in freshwater and half-life > 120 d and > 180 d in freshwater sediment). Among them, the four OP diesters B2,4DtBPP, BDCIPP, BDBPP, and BDBBP have relatively long estimated half-lives in various environmental media. OP diesters containing halogen atoms and aryl groups seem to be more persistent in environmental matrices. However, we strongly suggest that the persistence of OP diesters should be further confirmed by the use of laboratory experiments. Furthermore, it should be noted that current knowledge on the occurrence of OP diesters in natural water is very rare, and more efforts should be placed on this aspect.

## OP diesters in sludge/soil/sediment

There are few monitoring data of OP diesters in environmental soil and sediment, and numerous publications have reported the occurrence of OP diesters in wastewater sludge samples from wastewater treatment plants. According to the relevant literature, OP diesters were detected in wastewater sludge, wastewater suspended particulate matter, and sludge incineration ash in many regions of China or the United States. The OP diesters included DEP, DPrP, DnBP, DiBP, BBOEP, BEHP, BCEP, BCIPP, BDCIPP, DPHP, and bis(methylphenyl) phosphate (BMPP). The DF and concentration range of different OP diesters in wastewater sludge in the same area are very different, and the detection characteristics of the same diesters in different areas are also different.

In 2019, a study analyzed the concentrations of OP diesters in sewage sludge from 67 wastewater treatment plants across the United States, and 11 OP diesters were detectable regardless of the sampling sites. The DFs of DnBP, DiBP, BBOEP, and DPHP were as high as 100%, followed by BEHP (97%), DEP (96%), BDCIPP (89%), DPrP (86%), BMPP (85%), BCEP (62%), and BCIPP (32%). The DF of most diesters was more than 50%. The maximum detected concentration of BDCIPP was 1880 ng/g dry weight (dw), which was greater than that of all other OP diesters. The order of concentrations of the other diesters from highest to lowest was as follows: DPHP (1680 ng/g dw), BEHP (366 ng/g dw), BMPP (305 ng/g dw), BBOEP (219 ng/g dw), DiBP (130 ng/g dw), BCIPP (62.9 ng/g dw), DEP (50.6 ng/g dw), BCEP (26.2 ng/g dw), and DnBP (16.6 ng/g dw). Their total concentrations ranged from 22.9 to 1990 ng/g dw. In 2017, another study reported the concentrations of OP diesters in sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants from 36 cities across China. The order of target OP diesters by DF was BBOEP (100%), DPHP (100%), BCIPP (95.3%), DnBP (89.1%), BCEP (79.7%), and BDCIPP (32.8%). The order of diesters by maximum detected concentration was DPHP (861 ng/g dw), DnBP (406 ng/g dw), BCEP (287 ng/g dw), BCIPP (178 ng/g dw), BDCIPP (95.8 ng/g dw), and BBOEP (50.6 ng/g dw). The total concentration range of OP diesters was 17.0–1300 ng/g dw. The study also compared the pollution status of OP diesters in China with that in other developed countries and found that the pollution levels of OP diesters in China were relatively lower. They also stated that the pollution status could be related to the degree of economic development. In addition, the DF of DPHP and BEHP was 100% in 43 anaerobically digested sludge samples from Beijing, China. BDCIPP and DiBP were not detected, and the detected concentration of BEHP (11.2–275 ng/g dw) was the highest. Five kinds of OP diesters were detected in the sewage sludge of eight sewage treatment plants in the Pearl River Delta region of China, with the total concentrations varying in the range of LOQ-260 ng/g dw. Kim et al. detected the concentrations of DPHP and BDCIPP in wastewater sludge, wastewater suspended particulate matter, and sludge incineration ash in Albany, New York, United States. The DF of DPHP in combined sludge and sludge cake (92% and 69%, respectively) was higher than that of BDCIPP (8% and 23%, respectively), but the concentrations of BDCIPP were higher than that of DPHP. The mean concentrations in the combined sludge and the concentration range in the sludge cake of BDCIPP were 397 and 62.4–595 ng/g dw, respectively. In addition, DPHP and BDCIPP were also detected in suspended particles in wastewater (including influent, primary treatment wastewater and effluent). The DF of DPHP in ash (sludge incineration) was 83%, and the concentration was 14.8–81.6 ng/g dw.

Some studies also discussed the potential source and persistence of OP diesters in wastewater sludge samples. For instance, Fu et al. discussed the source of OP diesters in 64 sewage sludge samples from wastewater treatment plants in 36 cities across China from October 2010 to May 2011. They reported that nonchlorinated OP diesters were mainly derived from degradation in wastewater treatment plants, while the parent compounds (TCEP, TCIPP and TDCIPP) of chlorinated OP diesters (BCEP, BCIPP, and BDCIPP) have a long half-life; therefore, these compounds are difficult to degrade in wastewater treatment plants. However, the widespread occurrences of BCEP, BCIPP, and BDCIPP in wastewater sludge indicate that these three chlorinated OP diesters may come from external sources outside the wastewater treatment plants. alkali-catalyzed degradation of OP triesters. Therefore, the source of chlorinated OP diesters in the sewage treatment plant could be related to 1) excretion of urine from the population exposed to OP triesters and 2) (more likely) degradation of OP triesters in some industrial wastewater under alkaline conditions.

In summary, several key OP diesters have been detected in wastewater sludge in many countries. In addition, due to the reuse of wastewater sludge, these OP diesters will enter other environmental media. For example, it is estimated that 663–796 kg OP diesters can be imported into the soil every year in the United States because of the reuse of sludge in the soil. At present, there are few studies on the occurrence of OP diesters in soil media. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to pay attention to the migration of OP diesters and their potential risks due to sludge reuse.

### OP diesters in atmospheric samples

The data of OP diesters in the atmospheric environment are limited, and there are some studies working on human exposure to OP triesters and diesters via indoor dust samples. However, the number of research articles is relatively small, and the involved OP diesters are limited, mainly including BBOEP, BCEP, BCIPP, BDCIPP, BEHP, DoCP, DPHP, DEP, DnBP, B2,4DtBPP, DPrP, and DiBP. OP diesters have been detected in indoor dust samples in certain areas of China, the United States, Canada, Australia, Spain, the Netherlands, and other countries. The DFs and concentrations of the same OP diester are very different in different regions. The existing literature shows that the DFs and concentrations of BEHP and DPHP in indoor dust are generally high, and the concentrations of other OP diesters have regional differences. According to the available data, OP diesters are ubiquitous in indoor and outdoor dust in many countries.

In 2019, researchers analyzed OP diesters in indoor dust samples from 30 houses in Guangzhou in southern China and 17 houses in Carbondale (Illinois) in the midwestern United States. A total of six diesters were detected in Guangzhou, namely, BEHP (DF = 100%), DPHP (100%), BBOEP (90%), DoCP (90%), BDCIPP (77%), and BCIPP (13%); BCEP was not detected in the analyzed samples. According to the maximum detected concentrations, the order was BBOEP (<2–12,880 ng/g), BEHP (38.7–4490 ng/g), DPHP (31.24–4070 ng/g), BDCIPP (<12–699 ng/g), BCIPP (<10–124 ng/g), and DoCP (<2–66.5 ng/g), and the total concentration range of the OP diesters was 81.1–15,110 ng/g. The above six OP diesters were also detected in Carbondale (BCEP was not detected). The DFs of the six OP diesters were all above 75%, and the order of OP diesters according to the maximum detected concentration was BBOEP (96.0–85,950 ng/g), DPHP (903–27,460 ng/g), BEHP (237–14,070 ng/g), BDCIPP (<12–2550 ng/g), BCIPP (<10–530 ng/g) and DoCP (<2–62.8 ng/g). The total concentration range of OP diesters was 3060–100,000 ng/g. The DF of BEHP and DPHP in the indoor dust samples of the above two cities reached 100%, and BCEP was not detected. The diesters with the highest and lowest concentrations were BBOEP and DoCP, respectively. The total concentration and DF of OP diesters in indoor dust samples in Carbondale were higher than those in Guangzhou, China.

In 2018, B2,4DtBPP was detected in indoor dust samples in Toronto, Canada, and the DF was as high as 94%. Its highest concentration was 214 ng/g, and the concentrations of tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (also called AO168 = O or TDTBPP, CAS# 95906–11-9, regarded as the parent compound of B2,4DtBPP) in indoor dust were generally comparable to those of B2,4DtBPP. This is the first report on the concentration level of atypical OP diesters in indoor dust, indicating that humans can be exposed to B2,4DtBPP through indoor dust. In addition, TDTBPP was detected in e-waste dust, house dust, sediment from the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal, Indiana Harbor water filters, and filters from high-volume air samplers deployed in Chicago, IL. The widespread existence of B2,4DtBPP and its parent compound should attract our attention.

An article published in 2020 reported concentrations of OP diesters in 45 indoor dust samples collected from May 2015 to July 2017 in Guangzhou, China. The samples were collected in four different indoor environments, including residential houses, offices, environmental sample pretreatment laboratories, and instrument houses with analytical instruments. A total of seven OP diesters were detected: DnBP (DF = 100%), DPHP (100%), BDCIPP (90.9%), BBOEP (88.6%), DEP (88.6%), BCIPP (63.6%), and BCEP (43.2%). The above seven diesters were detected to different degrees in all indoor environments. The concentrations of OP diesters in four indoor environmental dust samples were 68.8–2312 ng/g (residential), 342–3895 ng/g (office), 444–3863 ng/g (laboratory), and 91.7–14,766 ng/g (instrument room). In this paper, the authors believed that DnBP and DPHP were the two main OP diesters in indoor dust samples and compared the concentrations of OP diesters in indoor dust samples from other countries. For example, the concentration of DPHP in indoor dust samples in southeastern Queensland, Australia, was 75–190 ng/g. In 2018, the DF of DPHP in dust samples from different environments (including living rooms, bedrooms, offices, on top of electronics, cars and public microenvironments) in Spain was 100%. The highest concentration (79,661 ng/g) of DPHP was in the car dust sample. In the Netherlands, the DF of DPHP in indoor dust collected from houses (including offices) and the top of electronics was as high as 100%, and the concentration ranges were 151–4189 ng/g and 218–6588 ng/g, respectively. In 2020, Wang et al. analyzed the concentrations of OP diesters in indoor and outdoor dust samples collected across mainland China. The DFs of DEP, DnBP, DiBP, BEHP, and DPHP in indoor and outdoor dust were more than 90%. In addition, the DF of DoCP also reached 95% in indoor dust. This report indicates that there is a certain correlation between indoor and outdoor dust, and DEP and DPHP are more likely to be degraded by the corresponding parent compounds (TEP, TPHP, and EHDPP) in dust.

Based on the abovementioned information, we found that environmental scientists have begun to pay attention to the concentration of OP diesters in indoor dust and human exposure levels in recent years. Typical OP diesters have been ubiquitous in indoor and outdoor dust and have become an important way to expose OP diesters to humans. Current studies have found that several typical OP diesters (such as DPHP, BBOEP, DnBP, BDCIPP, BEHP, etc.) exhibited relatively high DF and concentration in samples from China or the United States. It should be noted that among these target OP diesters, DPHP was detected at a high content in indoor dust in many countries (China, the United States, Spain, the Netherlands, etc.), and it should be given special attention in future studies. In addition, current publications demonstrate that concentrations of OP diesters in developing countries are seemingly lower than those in developed countries. Finally, current monitoring studies mainly focus on these widely concerned OP diesters, and future studies should also be expanded to other OP diesters to understand their atmospheric concentrations.

### OP diesters in biotic samples

At present, the presence of OP diesters has been reported in Great Lakes herring gull plasma, addled bald eagle eggs from the Great Lakes Region, and a batch of eggs collected in six states of Australia. The OP diesters included DnBP, DiBP, BEHP, BBOEP, BCIPP, DPHP, BDCIPP, BCEP, BDBPP, and DoCP. At present, OP diester monitoring studies in biotic samples are much smaller than those in humans.

An article published in 2014 reported the comparative body compartment composition and in ovo transfer of OP triesters in North American Great Lakes herring gulls. Researchers have pointed out that OP triesters are easily dealkylated to their respective diesters via hydrolysis in the body. In 2014, Su et al. analyzed the concentrations of OP diesters in six herring gull plasma. samples from Lake Huron (collected in 2010), and they reported the presence of BBOEP (DF = 100%), BDCIPP (100%), BEHP (50%), and DnBP (16.7%). BCIPP and DPHP were not detected in any of the analyzed samples. The order of concentrations from maximum to minimum were BBOEP (0.08–29.43 ng/g ww), BDCIPP (0.72–3.49 ng/g ww), DnBP (n.d.-0.41 ng/g ww), and BEHP (n.d.-0.18 ng/g ww). At the time, this was the first study to analyze and/or detect OP diesters in any biotic samples. The OP diester concentrations in all herring plasma samples were higher than those of their OP triester precursors, except TPHP and DPHP.

In 2018, Stubbings et al. reported the concentration of OP diesters in addled bald eagle eggs located in the Great Lakes region of the United States. A total of seven OP diesters were detected, including BBOEP (DF = 100%), DnBP (100%), DPHP (100%), BCEP (100%), BCIPP (100%), BDCIPP (100%), and BDBPP (90%). The order of OP diesters according to the maximum concentration was BDBPP (n.d.-45 ng/g ww), BCEP (0.38–26 ng/g ww), DnBP (0.73–10 ng/g ww), BCIPP (1.1–6.5 ng/g ww), BBOEP (0.27–6.2 ng/g ww), BDCIPP (1.4–5.1 ng/g ww), and DPHP (0.12–3.2 ng/g ww). This study reported the concentrations of BDBPP, which was the highest among all OP diesters in this study. It was concluded that the reason for this may have been due to the low DF of its parent compound TDBPP; therefore, the relative abundance calculations relied only on a small number of pairs (n = 3).

In 2020, Li et al. analyzed the concentrations of OP diesters in 153 chicken eggs purchased or collected across Australia from six states representing nine different geographic locations, including BCEP, BCIPP, BDCIPP, DBP (DiBP and DnBP), DoCP, DPHP, BBOEP, and BEHP. With the exceptions of BCEP and BCIPP (not detected in any of the analyzed samples), all other OP diesters were detectable in egg yolk and albumin samples. The authors found that much higher concentrations of OP diesters were found in yolk than albumin, suggesting the contribution of OPE metabolism in the liver to the level of OP diesters in yolk. In addition, the author pointed out that DPHP was the predominant OP diester in egg yolk.

Based on the datasets mentioned above, OP diesters are detectable in biological environmental samples, but monitoring datasets of OP diesters in wildlife samples are very rare currently. The biological species, distribution area, and types of OP diesters involved are limited, indicating that the study of OP diesters in organisms is unbalanced and incomplete. The detection characteristics for each OP diester are very different in different organisms. According to the available data, the concentrations of OP diesters in organisms were all below 100 ng/g ww and concentrated between 0 and 10 ng/g ww. At present, the occurrence of OP diesters in biotic samples is often related to the metabolism of its parent OP triesters, the source analysis of OP diesters is relatively simple, and the further metabolism of OP diesters in different organisms has not been deeply studied. Research on the “source” and “sink” of OP diesters in biotic samples is limited.

5.5. OP diesters in humans

At present, there are many monitoring datasets of OP diesters in human samples. Human samples mainly include human urine, human blood, nails, and hair. Most studies mainly regarded OP diesters as urine biomarkers of exposure to OP triesters. At present, some OP diesters have been detected in human blood samples collected from Jiangsu, Shenzhen, and Beijing in China. In addition, almost all kinds of OP diesters in this article have been detected in urine samples collected from different types of people in many countries. The sample population covers different age groups, different occupational exposure levels, and some special groups. In addition to analyzing the concentrations of OP diesters in urine to evaluate the exposure level of OP triesters, some studies also focused on the difference and correlation of the concentrations of the same OP diester among different family members or assessed the association between OP diester concentrations in the urine and environmental and behavioral risk factors. In addition, several typical OP diesters have been detected in human nails and hair. Existing data show that a variety of OP diesters have been widely found in humans; therefore, it is necessary to continuously track and evaluate the occurrence and impact of OP diesters in humans.

5.5.1. Human blood

There are few studies on the occurrence of OP diesters in human blood because the impact of OP triesters and diesters on humans has been mainly assessed through noninvasive methods (urine, hair, nails, saliva, etc.). OPEs are not easily measured in human blood or serum; therefore, little is known about their internal human exposure level. In the existing literature, OP diesters have been detected in human blood samples collected from Jiangsu, Shenzhen, and Beijing in China, including DnBP, BEHP, BBOEP, DPHP, DpCP, DoCP, DiBP, BCEP, BCIPP, and BDCIPP. The sample population was mainly nonoccupationally exposed adults. The DFs of the same OP diester in human blood samples collected from different regions were very different, but the difference in detection concentrations was not statistically significant. The detection concentrations and DFs of different OP diesters were very different. In general, most of the OP diesters mentioned above have a higher DF in human blood, and the detection levels of BEHP and DPHP were higher. However, due to the lack of relevant data, it is impossible to make a more in-depth and comprehensive comparison.

In 2019, DnBP (DF = 60%), BEHP (99%), BBOEP (33%), and DPHP (76%) were detected in human blood samples from 99 nonoccupationally exposed adults in Jiangsu Province, China, and the reported concentrations were sorted from highest to lowest as follows: BEHP (44.7 ng/mL), DPHP (3.0 ng/mL), DnBP (2.1 ng/mL), and BBOEP (1.6 ng/mL). They found that even nonoccupationally exposed people had a certain concentration of OP diesters in the blood samples. In the same year, DPHP (DF = 9%) and DpCP (4%) were detected in blood samples of 259 residents in Shenzhen, China, with concentration ranges of < 0.12–3.31 ng/mL and < 0.08–2.21 ng/mL, respectively. A study published in 2020 reported the contamination levels of OP diesters in the blood samples of 57 adult volunteers recruited in a hospital in Beijing, China, including DnBP, DiBP, BEHP, BBOEP, BCEP, BCIPP, BDCIPP, DPHP, DoCP, and DpCP. BEHP was the main OP diester and was detected in almost all whole blood, serum and urine samples. The highest concentration was observed for BEHP in whole blood (24.0 ng/mL). Among the above OP diesters, the DFs of DnBP, DiBP, BEHP, BCIPP, and DPHP in whole blood samples were more than 90%. By calculating the concentration ratio of OP diesters between whole blood and urine, the researchers stated that OP diesters with low hydrophobicity are prone to be excreted through urine. Current literature regarding OP diesters in blood samples did not cover all the existing OP diesters.

5.5.2. Human urine

At present, human urine is a common medium for the detection of OP diesters. The number of studies regarding the occurrence of OP diesters in human urine is very high, and these studies cover a wide range of regions, populations, and research directions. Among all OP diesters in this article, only di-meta-cresyl phosphate (DmCP), B2,4DtBPP, BDBPP, and BDBBP have not yet been analyzed in human urine, and it has been reported that DBzP has not been detected in any of the analyzed human urine samples so far. Some typical OP diesters were detected at varying concentrations in urine samples of different populations in different regions. At present, biomonitoring studies of OP diesters in human urine samples are mainly concentrated in China and the United States and include Canada, Belgium, Australia, the Netherlands, Norway, Japan, and Germany. The population types include adults, children, ordinary residents, firefighters, pregnant women, primiparas, hospitalized or boarding babies, etc. The research direction is mainly to use OP diester concentrations in urine as the evaluation index of OP triester exposure levels. Some studies have focused on the difference and correlation of OP diester concentrations among family-based populations, such as “mother and child” and “husband and wife”. Some studies have analyzed the changing trend of the concentrations of OP diesters in human urine with time, age or sex. Some studies have focused on the establishment of a method for the detection and analysis of OP diesters in urine samples. In addition, the main intent of some studies was to analyze the correlation between the concentrations of OP diesters in urine and the following factors: the use of self-reported personal care and household products, the use of electronic cigarettes, the concentration of PFRs in hand wipes and indoor dust, the temperature of outdoor air, and the effects on reproductive development.

We have summarized the DF and concentration range of OP diesters in urine (Table S5). Among them, many documents have reported that the DF of DPHP and BDCIPP in human urine samples was 100%. In addition, DnBP, BBOEP, BCEP, DiBP, DEP, BEHP, BCIPP, DoCP, DpCP, and isopropyl diphenyl phosphate (ip-DPHP) were also detected in urine samples in some areas with a DF of 100%. Several widely concerned OP diesters have been detected in human urine samples from most countries, and DPHP has a relatively high concentration. The detection concentration of DPHP in the Australian population is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that in other countries. In addition, other diesters have a concentration level equivalent to DPHP in human urine in corresponding countries, for example, BCEP (in China and Canada).

| Country        | DPHP (ng/mL) | DnBP (ng/mL) | BCIPP (ng/mL) | BDCIPP (ng/mL) | BBOEP (ng/mL) | BCEP (ng/mL) |

The distribution of organophosphate (OP) diester factories in the world and the species and concentration composition of six OP diesters (DPHP, DnBP, BCIPP, BDCIPP, BBOEP, and BCEP) in different countries. The average value (ng/mL) of all the reported median (or geometric mean) concentration in the relevant literature of each OP diester in human urine samples of different countries. In some special regions, several OP diesters, which were not important compounds, have been reported to have a relatively high DF or concentration in human urine samples. For example, a study published in 2019 reported that DMP exhibited a high DF of 80% in human urine samples (including the general population and firefighters) in Atlanta, United States, and its highest detection concentration in the general population reached 130 ng/mL. The DF of DPrP in urine samples of 19 healthy volunteers in Albany, New York, United States was 73%. In 2018, a study analyzed 181 urine samples from children in the United States and found that the DF of t-butyl diphenyl phosphate (tb-DPHP) was as high as 94.5%. In addition, in the urine samples of 155 women using assisted reproductive technology in Boston, Massachusetts, the highest detectable concentration of tb-DPHP reached 347 ng/mL. In 2018, the DFs of DoCP and DpCP in the urine samples of 57 adult volunteers collected in a hospital in Beijing, China were 71% and 69%, respectively. In urine samples of children aged 0–5 years and 3–29 months collected in Queensland, Australia, the DFs of BMPP were 80% and 96%, respectively. The DF of tBPPP in urine samples of firefighters in Atlanta was 83%. Other nonhotspot OP diesters have a low DF and limited human urine detection data. For example, the DF of 2-((isopropyl) phenyl) phenyl hydrogen phosphate (ip-PPP) in urine samples from firefighters in Atlanta, United States, was 35%.

The concentration levels of OP diesters in human urine are summarized in Table S7. The difference in the minimum detection concentration is not significant, all of which are lower than the detection limit or quantitative limit. The highest levels reported for DMP, DPHP, tb-DPHP, BCEP, and BDCIPP in human urine were higher (>100 ng/mL). Among them, DPHP was detected in human urine samples with the highest concentration of 727 ng/mL and the highest level was found in Australia (the age strata of sampling were 0–5 years). The highest concentrations of DMP, tb-DPHP, BCEP, and BDCIPP appeared in the United States, and the highest concentrations of DMP, DPHP, tb-DPHP and BDCIPP were found in urine samples from firefighters, women receiving assisted reproductive technology, and children. The highest concentrations of DEP, DnBP, ip-DPHP, and BCIPP in human urine were between 50 and 100 ng/mL. Except for the highest concentration of BCIPP in Nanchang, China, the highest concentrations of DEP, DnBP, and ip-DPHP appeared in different parts of the United States, and the highest urine concentrations of DEP and ip-DPHP appeared in firefighters and women receiving assisted reproductive technology, respectively. In the literature, we found that the highest concentrations of the remaining OP diesters (including DPrP, DiBP, BEHP, BBOEP, ip-PPP, tBPPP, DoCP, DpCP, and BMPP) in human urine were less than 14 ng/mL.

At present, the number of studies related to the detection of OP diesters in human urine is the largest, but most studies still have the problem of incomplete coverage of OP diesters. We can find in Table S7 that OP diesters, which are not research hotspots, may also have a high detection level in human urine.

### Human hair and nails

In 2017, a study reported the levels of OP diesters in scalp hair, fingers, and toenails collected over two months in two volunteers (female and male) to evaluate the exposure levels of OP triesters. DPHP levels were extremely high (in the μg/g range) in both finger and toenails of females. BBOEP and BDCIPP were the minor diesters detected in nails, with average levels of 28–64 ng/g and < 2.2–4.1 ng/g, respectively. DPHP was the only OP diester detected in hair (0.23–0.25 ng/g). There is evidence that hair and nails (fingers and toes) may be good indicators of human exposure to OP triesters, especially exposure to TPHP.

### Current knowledge on the adverse effects of OP diesters

OP triesters have been used as FRs in massive quantities and are widely applied in various household and industrial products. OP triesters are easily released to the surrounding environments through the processes of volatilization, leaching, abrasion, and dissolution, which have been detected in multiple environmental media. Previous studies have reported that humans can be exposed to OP triesters via skin contact, ingestion of dust or ingestion from diet in daily life. Prolonged exposure and the accumulation of OP triesters in the human body may cause toxic effects such as kidney toxicity, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, carcinogenicity, and endocrine disruption. However, as the main metabolites of OP triesters, the toxicity of OP diesters has rarely been reported. According to statistics, the current toxicity studies on OP diesters focused primarily on 11 substances, namely, DEP, BEHP, DPHP, BDBPP, BCIPP, BDCIPP, B2,4DtBPP, BBOEP, BCEP, DnBP, and ip-DPHP. Here, the toxicity of OP diesters is summarized from three aspects: animals, humans and others. An overview of the collected toxicological information is given.

#### Animals

At present, many studies have used animals as research objects to explore the toxicity mechanism of certain OP diesters (mainly DEP, DPHP, BDBPP, BDCIPP, B2,4DtBPP, BEHP, BBOEP, BCEP, DnBP, and BCIPP). Based on current studies, various toxic effects of OP diesters in animals have been found, such as developmental toxicity, reproductive toxicity, nephrotoxicity, and immunotoxicity simultaneously. OP diesters can also interfere with many biological processes (mainly gene expression, metabolism, nuclear receptor activity, and sterol synthesis). At present, research on developmental toxicity and the effects of gene expression and nuclear receptor activity have become the three main directions for research.

Regarding the developmental toxicity of OP diesters, Yang investigated the effects on male Wistar rats following exposure to different concentrations of DEP and found that a high dose of DEP caused significantly lower body weights after 20 weeks of exposure. Zhang exposed zebrafish embryos to BCIPP, BDCIPP, or DPHP and observed malformation (including pericardial effusion, hypopigmentation, yolk sac edema, short tail, and body curvature) in the corresponding zebrafish larvae. The malformation rates were up to 50.0%, 33.3%, and 27.8% at 0.1 μM, respectively. In another study, after the exposure of zebrafish embryos to 4.00 μg∙L DPHP, Li et al. also observed significant malformation, which potentially affected the development of zebrafish embryos. However, in another study, Lee reported that BCEP did not elicit pericardial edema or blood flow reduction in trunk vessels, even at the highest concentration tested.

Based on studies of the existing target substances, we found that most OP diesters can produce biotoxicity by altering the expression of several genes. For instance, via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays, Zhang found that the expression of genes related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) and hypothalamic-pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axes was altered in zebrafish embryos following exposure to BCIPP, BDCIPP, and DPHP. Kelly performed quantitative label-free LC-MS/MS on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO-K1 and CHO-DP12) cultured in a series of concentrations of B2,4DtBPP to analyze changes in cell protein composition. | Compound | Effect | Study Type | Toxicity Type |

found that eight proteins were commonly differentially expressed (five upregulated and three downregulated) in response to exposure, indicating that the compound highlights biological processes related to cellular stress, such as enrichment for cellular stress (Heme oxygenase 1), endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded-protein response (Hypoxia upregulated protein 1) and toxic substance response (Stress-70 protein). Previous research on whether exposure to BDBPP disrupted DNA structures has found that BDBPP caused DNA damage at the concentration of 70 μmol∙kg 1 in vivo experiments (kidneys, testes, liver, spleen, lungs, small intestine and brain) and 10 μmol∙kg 1 in vitro (liver cells and testicular cells) experiments. However, BDBPP was less potent than its parent compound (tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (TDBPP)) in causing kidney DNA damage. Li et al. investigated the expression of genes in zebra embryos following exposure to DPHP, and several genes (including nkx2.1, uglab, and tg) were significantly altered. In another in vitro study, DPHP significantly downregulated nine target genes in CEHs, and these genes were related to lipid/cholesterol metabolism, glucose/fatty acid metabolism, and other important metabolic pathways. Porter et al. applied a PCR array to screen the mRNA expression effect in CEHs after exposure to BEHP, and they discovered that BEHP had no significant effect on genetic changes.

Interference with nuclear receptor activity is another important mechanism by which OP diesters induce toxicity. Zhang et al. applied dual-luciferase reporter gene assays to explore the agonistic and antagonistic effects of BCIPP, BDCIPP, and DPHP against rat estrogenic receptor alpha (ERα) and human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). They discovered that BCIPP induced estrogenic activity at all test concentrations, BDCIPP acted as an ER agonist at 10 6 M or above, and the significant response of DPHP only occurred at 10 5 M. Simultaneously, all three metabolites exhibited MR antagonistic activity with RIC20 (concentration of the test compound showing 20% of the antagonistic activity) values of 8.1 × 10 7 M, 1.1 × 10 8 M, and 4.2 × 10 7 M, respectively. OP diesters pose more endocrine-disrupting potential than their parent OP triesters, indicating that it is necessary to conduct comprehensive studies on OP diesters. OP diesters may produce comparable or even higher endocrine disrupting effects than OP triesters.

6.2. Humans

For most studies, adverse effects of OP triesters were generally explored via the associations between concentrations of OP diesters in human samples and levels of biomarkers related to typical disease. These studies used OP diesters as metabolites of OP triesters and found that OP diesters (including DPHP, BDCIPP, B2,4DtBPP, BCEP, DnBP, BCIPP, ip-PPP, and ip-DPHP) in the human body are associated with a variety of biomarkers of human health. The adverse effects corresponding to these markers include developmental toxicity, reproductive toxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurodevelopmental toxicity, interference with thyroid homeostasis, affecting sterol synthesis, and obesity.

For instance, in studies related to the effects of ip-PPP, BDCIPP, and DPHP on pregnancy, Hoffman et al. found that women with higher ip-PPP concentrations delivered girls earlier; women with BDCIPP levels above the median had 3.99 times the odds of delivering their daughters preterm, while higher maternal DPHP concentrations were associated with a modest increase in gestational duration among male infants. Using in vitro fertilization (IVF) to investigate human reproduction and pregnancy outcomes, Carignan et al. found that concentrations of the above three OP diesters (ip-DPHP, BDCIPP, and DPHP) were negatively associated with proportions of successful fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth. In another study, Meeker et al. discovered that urinary DPHP was associated with decreased sperm concentration and increased serum prolactin. Furthermore, they also reported associations between urinary BDCIPP concentrations and parameters of semen quality or sperm motion. In addition, exposure to DPHP, BDCIPP, and DnBP is associated with altered serum sex hormone levels in children, adolescents and adults. Analogously, DnBP has also been confirmed to have a significantly inverse association with total testosterone (TT), estradiol (E2), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in adolescents. In terms of nephrotoxicity, Kang et al. assessed the association between BCEP, BDCIPP, and DnBP (as metabolites of OP triesters) levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related parameters, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). They concluded that the urinary BCEP level was negatively associated with eGFR and that BDCIPP and DnBP were positively associated with the ACR, which further proved that these three compounds were related to CKD. In studies of neurodevelopmental toxicity, Castorina et al. observed decreases in the full-scale intelligence quotient and working memory with increasing prenatal DPHP and total OP triester metabolite levels. However, no significant associations were found between neurodevelopment and BDCIPP or ip-PPP. related to interference with thyroid hormones, Preston et al. found a significant positive association between high DPHP concentrations (≥2.65 ng∙mL 1) and total thyroxine (TT4) levels in women and a suggestive positive association with total triiodothyronine (TT3). In another study, Kojima et al. reported that OP diesters (including BCIPP, BCEP, DnBP, DPHP, BBOEP, and BDCIPP) may have limited human nuclear receptor activity compared to their parent OP triesters.

Although most studies believe that OP triesters are toxic active substances, the mechanisms of adverse effects are unknown, and OP diesters have nonmetabolic sources. Therefore, whether OP diesters play a role in the abovementioned toxicity to humans needs further research. There is a lack of direct evidence and in-depth research on the adverse effects of OP diesters on humans.

### Others

Bacteria, algae, and computer simulation methods have also been applied in the literature to investigate the toxicity of OP diesters, especially for DEP and BEHP. Yang et al. explored the potential mechanisms of the molecular interaction of pesticide triazophos (TAP) and its major metabolites with endocrine hormone-related proteins using molecular docking in silico and found that DEP may affect the biosynthesis of steroid hormones and thyroid hormones. In addition, DEP may disrupt the binding and transport of thyroid hormones in the blood and the normal binding of thyroid hormones to their receptors. In an acute toxicity test of BEHP, Douville et al. discovered that BEHP displayed high toxicity in bacteria (Vibrio fisheri), algae (Pseudokirshneriella subcapitata), and invertebrates (Hydra attenuata and Daphnia magna), but not in Thamnocephalus platyurus. In addition, BEHP can also alter the gene expression levels of E. coli., and 119 genes were significantly altered following exposure to 145.8 μM BEHP. These altered genes are involved in multiple biological processes, such as modification of RNA, transfer RNA (tRNA) metabolism processes, tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) metabolic processes, amino acid activation, and organonitrogen compound metabolic processes.

In conclusion, there are only a few studies on the toxicity of OP diesters. In the existing studies, when animals were used as research objects, current studies consistently reported alterations in gene expression, and the involved pathways were hormone-level disorder, metabolic abnormalities, and other adverse effects. In studies associated with toxicity in humans, most OP diesters were used to study their correlation with some major biological processes in the human body as urine biomarkers of OP triester exposure. The accumulation of OP diesters in the human body may interfere with the activity of reproductive hormones and related nuclear receptors, which could eventually be reflected in the reduction of pregnancy time and decreased fertilization success rate. Therefore, reproductive toxicity could be the main cause of human toxicity. In general, the current research on OP diesters still faces problems (including limited types of target OP diesters, scattered research directions, lack of common points, and incomplete research).

### Research directions

Based on the studies to date, the present review has clearly illustrated that a high quantity of OP diesters are produced around the world. Combined with the fact that OP diesters could also be generated from the degradation of OP triesters, it is plausible to observe the ubiquity of OP diesters in the overall environment. Considering the potential health risk of OP diester exposure, we predict that OP diesters will certainly be major and environmentally relevant contaminants for the foreseeable future. Here, seven research gaps and priority future research directions regarding OP diesters are proposed and summarized in Table 5.

During our research on the status of industrial production, we surprisingly observed that OP diesters are currently being produced in 169 factories around the world, and 124 out of 169 factories are located in Mainland China. The total APV is estimated at 17,050 metric tons. This APV value is underestimated due to the limitation of available information from suppliers. To fully and unbiasedly assess the status of industrial production of OP diesters, we strongly suggest that more effort should continue to conduct market research on industrial production and commercial applications of OP diesters around the world. Following this point, the huge quantity of industrial production of OP diesters may suggest that this group of substances could serve as contaminants in humans via direct inhalation or dietary pathways. Thus, further studies should be conducted to evaluate the suitability of OP diesters as biomarkers of exposure to OP triesters, especially for several OP diesters with large production volumes.

OP diesters have the typical structure of O = P(OR)2(OH)); thus, this specific functional group of phosphoric acids would lead to unique physicochemical properties for these groups of emerging contaminants. Thus, it is plausible to predict that OP diesters would exhibit totally different environmental behaviors or fates than OP triesters. In this review, we tried to assess their properties by use of the USEPA EPI suite; however, this effort is far below the standards to correctly and fully characterize their environmental behaviors and fates in the environment. Thus, it is critical to fill the following knowledge gaps with future research directions: 1) to empirically analyze the physicochemical properties of OP diesters in the laboratory; 2) to assess and understand whether OP diesters would further degrade in organisms or environments; and 3) to examine the partition among different environmental matrices and transportation among different regions.

Regarding the occurrence of OP diesters, current monitoring studies are confined to several important substances, i.e., DnBP, BEHP, BBOEP, DPHP, BCEP, BCIPP, and BDCIPP. In addition, the sampling sites are mainly concentrated in a few countries or districts, i.e., the United States and China. Thus, it is recommended that OP diesters be monitored systematically and comprehensively by involving more target OP diesters, more countries, and more environmental matrices. Furthermore,

OP diesters were widely found in wastewater treatment plants (including wastewater, waste sludge, sludge cake and ash after sludge incineration), but the occurrence and concentration data for OP diesters in related surface water, groundwater, sediment and soil were scarce. For the toxicity of OP diesters, there are few studies available in the current literature, although there is increasing interest from environmental scientists to study the toxicity of OP triesters. Research regarding the toxicity of OP diesters also faces other problems, i.e., 1) only several important OP diesters were involved in these toxicological studies; and 2) very limited animal models were applied for the assessment of toxicity of the OP diesters. Thus, in future toxicological studies of OP diesters, we suggest that researchers should expand the types of target OP diesters and discuss the research contents in depth; for example,

combined with quantitative analysis to analyze the toxicity reaction and toxicity mechanism of OP diesters under different exposure modes (dermal contact, dust ingestion, inhalation and dietary intake) and establish RfDs. Potential health effects are associated with long-term exposure to OP diesters, and a report on the effects of OP diesters on public health should be obtained.
