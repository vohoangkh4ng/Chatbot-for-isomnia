## Background

Emerging evidence has proved the associations between exposure to phthalates (PAEs) and bisphenols and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the underlying mechanisms for these associations are poorly understood. Metabolomics is a powerful tool to identify differential metabolites and metabolic pathways related to diseases and chemical exposure, which may reveal underlying mechanisms. However, little is known about the roles of metabolism in the associations for PAE and bisphenol exposure with T2DM.

## Objectives

The purpose of the study was to investigate the roles of metabolism in the associations for exposure to PAEs and bisphenols with T2DM.

## Methods

In this study, 60 T2DM cases and 60 controls, who were matched in age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), were selected from the total study population in our previous studies. Fasting blood and spot urine samples of the volunteers were used for non-targeted metabolomics analysis and determination of phthalate metabolites (mPAEs) and bisphenols, respectively. The associations of urinary mPAEs and bisphenols with screened metabolic biomarkers in metabolomics analysis were analyzed using multiple linear regression models.

## Results

Based on non-targeted metabolomics, 19 serum metabolic biomarkers were screened between T2DM cases and controls, mostly related to galactose metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism. More than half of mPAEs were mostly positively associated with up-regulated metabolic biomarkers and negatively associated with down-regulated biomarkers. Different from PAEs, no evident results suggested the roles of metabolism in the associations between bisphenol exposure and T2DM.

## Conclusions

Combined with the positive associations between most urinary mPAEs and T2DM in our previous study, our findings indicated that PAE exposure may contribute to T2DM risk through disturbing galactose metabolism, amino acid metabolism (especially arginine biosynthesis and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism), and pyrimidine metabolism.

## 1. Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease, characterized with high levels of blood glucose because the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin efficiently. Among the different types of DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as the main type of DM, accounts for approximately 90% of diabetics. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has confirmed that DM is one of the fastest growing diseases in the 21st century. In 2019, there were 463 million people with DM worldwide, and the number was expected to reach 700 million by 2045. Besides genetic predispositions, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy diet, emerging evidence has suggested that exposure to environmental chemicals may be involved in the etiology of DM. ## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Study population

T2DM cases and controls were recruited between May 2016 and June 2017 in Tianjin, China, as described in previous studies. Briefly, T2DM cases were the outpatients from the Metabolic Diseases Hospital, Tianjin Medical University and controls were staff and support workers from Nankai University, Tianjin. Fasting blood and spot urine samples of the volunteers were both collected. Fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured in the hospital. Afterwards, along with urine samples, serum samples were transported to our laboratory on ice and stored at -80 ℃ for further analysis. The people with fasting glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% were classified as T2DM cases depending on the diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Association, and according to the normal reference ranges on the analysis report, the subjects with fasting glucose between 3.89 and 6.11 mmol/L and HbA1c between 3.8% and 5.8% were grouped into controls. All volunteers consented to participate and information on age, sex, height, weight, smoking status, drinking status, education levels, exercising, family history of diabetes, and blood pressure were collected by questionnaires. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters. In our previous studies, about 250 T2DM cases and 250 controls were included. In the present study, considering the differences of age, sex, and BMI in the risk of DM, 60 T2DM cases and 60 controls, who were matched in age (±1 year), sex, and BMI (±0.9 kg/m2), were selected. The study protocol received ethical approval from Nankai University and Metabolic Diseases Hospital, Tianjin Medical University.

### 2.2. Measurement of urinary mPAEs and bisphenols

Concentrations of mPAEs and bisphenols in urine were determined using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) after enzymatic hydrolysis and solid phase extraction or liquid–liquid extraction, which has been described in our prior studies. The target mPAEs included monomethyl phthalate (mMP), monoethyl phthalate (mEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (mBP), mono (2-isobutyl) phthalate (miBP), mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (mEHP), monobenzyl phthalate (mBzP), mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (mCPP), mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (mEHHP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (mEOHP), mono (2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (mECPP), and mono [(2-carboxymethyl) hexyl] phthalate (mCMHP). The determined eight bisphenols included BPA, BPS, BPAF, bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol P (BPP), bisphenol AP (BPAP), bisphenol Z (BPZ), and bisphenol B (BPB). Urinary creatinine concentrations were analyzed using HPLC-MS/MS to correct the influence of urine dilution, as reported in the previous study.

### 2.3. Determination of serum metabolites

Serum samples were analyzed according to previous described methods, with some modification. Briefly, frozen serum samples were thawed at 4 ℃ on ice and an aliquot (100 μL) of serum was added to 400 μL of extraction mixture (methanol/acetonitrile = 1/1, v/v) containing 0.8 μg of 2-chloro-L-phenylalanine as internal standard. Then, the samples were mixed under vortex for 30 s, followed with an ultrasound treatment for 5 min in ice water. Afterwards, the samples were incubated for 1 h at -20 ℃ to precipitate proteins. After centrifugation at 12000 rpm (4 ℃) for 15 min, nearly 400 μL of the supernatant was collected and concentrated to near dryness under a vacuum concentrator without heating. Then, the extract was reconstituted in 100 μL of extraction mixture (acetonitrile/Milli-Q). Y. Duan et al.

water = 1/1, v/v), followed by vortex for 30 s and ultrasound treatment for 10 min in ice water. After centrifugation at 12000 rpm (4 ℃) for 15 min, 60 μL of the supernatant was transferred into glass vials for instrumental analysis. In addition, 10 μL of the supernatant of each sample was taken out and pooled as quality control (QC) samples. The determination of serum metabolites was accomplished using an Agilent 1290 Series ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC; Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) coupled with an AB 6600 triple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF, AB Sciex, MA, USA). Two microliters of final solution were injected onto a UPLC BEH Amide column (100 mm × 2.1 mm × 1.7 μm; Waters, MA, USA). The mobile phase was comprised of Milli-Q water containing 25 mM ammonium acetate and 25 mM aqueous ammonia (pH = 9.75) (A) and acetonitrile (B) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The gradient was as follows: 0–0.5 min, 95% B; 7 min, 65% B; 8–9 min, 40% B; 9.1–12.0 min, 95% B. The mass spectrometer was operated in both positive and negative electrospray ionization. The spray voltages were set at 5000 V and 4000 V for positive and negative ion modes, respectively. The ion source temperature was 650 ℃. Nebulizer gas pressure, curtain gas pressure, and auxiliary gas pressure were separately set at 60 psi, 35 psi, and 60 psi. The scan range was 60 to 1000 m/z. The MS/MS spectra were acquired based on an information dependent acquisition (IDA) mode. In this mode, the acquisition software (Analyst TF 1.7, AB Sciex, MA, USA) triggered the mass spectrometer to acquire the MS/MS spectra of 12 precursor ions with intensity greater than 100 in each cycle. There were 15 MS/MS spectra produced every 50 ms. The collision energy was set at 30 eV. One QC sample and one blank sample were both injected to monitor the stability and reproducibility of instruments every 20 serum samples.

2.4. Metabolome data processing and analyses

The ProteoWizard software (CA, USA) was used to convert the MS raw data to mzXML format. Afterwards, the data were processed by the R package XCMS (version 3.2), including retention time correction, peak identification, peak extraction, peak area integration, and peak alignment. R package CAMERA was applied for peak annotation and in-house MS2 database was used for metabolite identification. The peaks with detection rates greater than 50% in both groups were retained for further analyses and the missing values were replaced with a value of half of the minimum. The matched metabolites were those with the matching scores of MS2 higher than 0.6. The data were normalized with the internal standard. Normalized data were imported into SIMCA software (V14.1, Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB, Umea, Sweden) for multivariate statistical analyses. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to examine the separation of the two groups and to identify outliers. A tight clustering of QC samples was observed in the score scatter plots of PCA models (Figure S1a and S1b in the Supporting Information, SI), suggesting that the data quality was suitable for further analysis. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), as a supervised pattern recognition approach, was carried out to get a snapshot of the systematic metabolism in T2DM cases and controls. A 200-time permutation test was performed to evaluate the developed OPLS-DA models (Figure S2, the SI). The y-intercepts of Q2 regression lines were<0.05 in both positive and negative modes, indicating the better robustness and no overfitting of the developed OPLS-DA models. The features were recognized as the differential metabolites depending on the following criteria: (1) variable importance in the projection (VIP) scores of features in the OPLS-DA models greater than 1; (2) p-values of features between T2DM cases and controls from Student’s t-test < 0.05. The pathway analysis of differential metabolites was conducted on MetaboAnalyst 5.0 to explore the key pathways related to risk of T2DM.

2.5. Statistical analyses

The concentrations of mECPP, mCMHP, mEHHP, mEOHP, and mEHP were summed to represent the total concentrations of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites (∑mDEHP). The concentrations of eleven mPAEs and eight bisphenols were separately summed to calculate the total concentrations of mPAEs (∑mPAEs) and bisphenols (∑BPs). Several compounds, including mBzP, BPAP, BPP, BPZ, and BPB, were excluded from the further analyses owing to the low detection rates (<30%). In addition, except BPF and BPAF, the values below the limits of detection (LODs) shown in our previous studies were replaced with LODs/for the other target compounds. To explore the potential selection bias of study population, differences in levels of mPAEs and bisphenols between the subjects of the present analysis and the total population were analyzed using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests. Demographic characteristics between T2DM cases and controls were compared using chi-square tests for categorical variables and independent-sample t tests for continuous variables due to the normal distributions of age and BMI. Medians and interquartile ranges for concentrations of mPAEs and bisphenols were calculated and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests were used to evaluate the differences of urinary mPAEs and bisphenols in both groups. Spearman correlation analyses were performed among determined urinary mPAEs and bisphenols. The associations between urinary levels of mPAEs and bisphenols and risk of T2DM have been analyzed in our prior studies. Therefore, in this study, we only analyzed the associations of urinary mPAEs and bisphenols with screened metabolic biomarkers using multiple linear regression models. Peak intensity of screened metabolites and urinary levels of mPAEs and bisphenols were log-transformed in the regression analyses to ensure the normal distribution of residuals. Age (continuous), sex (categorical), BMI (continuous), smoking status (categorical), drinking status (categorical), exercising status (categorical), education levels (categorical), family history of diabetes (categorical), and blood pressure status (categorical) were retained as covariates in the multi-adjusted regression models if they were significant (i.e., p < 0.05) in the associations of urinary mPAEs and bisphenols with screened metabolic biomarkers. All data analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 22.0; SPSS, IL, USA), and a two-sided p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3. Results

3.1. Population characteristics

Demographic characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. The mean age and BMI of the study population were 56 ± 7 years and 25.0 ± 2.7 kg/m2, respectively. Over half (55%) of the subjects were males. There were no significant differences in age, sex, BMI, smoking status, exercising status, and blood pressure between T2DM cases and controls. Additionally, in comparison with case group, the education levels of controls were higher. The proportion of participants with family history of diabetes in cases was higher than that in controls, whereas the proportion of people who sometimes drank in controls was higher than that in cases.

3.2. Urinary mPAEs and bisphenols

Urinary levels of mPAEs and bisphenols are listed in Table 2. All ∑mPAEs and more than 95% of study subjects were detected with ∑BPs. Each individual mPAE was detected in more than 90% samples except mCPP. For T2DM cases, mBP, mMP, and miBP were the predominant mPAEs in urine, with a median concentration of 93.22, 71.09, and 64.39 μg/g creatinine, respectively, whereas mBP (54.39 μg/g creatinine), mMP (20.22 μg/g creatinine), mCMHP Table 1

(17.22 μg/g creatinine), and mEP (16.43 μg/g creatinine) were the main compounds in control group. The levels of bisphenols were one or two orders of magnitude lower than mPAEs. Thereinto, BPA was the predominant bisphenol in urine of the study population and detected in more than 70% samples, followed by BPS (53.4%), BPAF (43.4%), and BPF (35.9%). Most of urinary mPAEs in T2DM cases were significantly higher than those in controls (p < 0.05), except that mECPP, mCMHP, mEHHP, and mEP showed no significant differences between the two groups. For bisphenols, only urinary levels of BPS in cases were significantly higher than those in controls, whereas no differences were found for the concentrations of BPA, BPF, BPAF, and cases and controls. In addition, there were no significant differences in levels of mPAEs and bisphenols between the subjects of the present analysis and the total study population except BPAF.

Spearman correlation analysis showed that the five metabolites of DEHP (i.e., mECPP, mCMHP, mEHHP, mEOHP, and mEHP) were significantly correlated with each other, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.350 to 0.886 in controls and ranging from 0.266 to 0.926 in T2DM cases. Compared to controls, more significant correlations between mPAEs were observed in case.

The pathway analysis of differential metabolites is shown in Fig. 2. In the present study, the pathways with p-value < 0.05 in the enrichment analysis or the impact value greater than 0.2 in the topology analysis were regarded as the key ones related to T2DM. A total of eight pathways were selected, including arginine biosynthesis, galactose. Fig. 1.

There were 19 metabolites involved in the 8 pathways. Compared to controls, most of metabolites in serum were significantly up-regulated in T2DM cases, including sucrose, raffinose, galactinol, alpha-D-glucose, galactitol, myo-inositol, L-glutamate, argininosuccinic acid, L-asparagine, dihydrouracil, orotate, thymidine, cytidine 5′-monophosphate (CMP), and riboflavin, whereas the others (i.e., L-arginine, L-histidine, L-citrulline, pyridoxal, and deoxycytidine) were down-regulated in T2DM cases.

3.4. Associations of exposure to PAEs and bisphenols with screened metabolic biomarkers

Associations of exposure to PAEs and bisphenols with the 19 screened metabolic biomarkers are shown in Table 3 and Table S5. Thereinto, urinary mEOHP, mEHP, ∑mDEHP, mCPP, miBP, mMP, and ∑mPAEs showed significant positive associations with most of the up-regulated metabolites, and the levels of mEOHP, mCPP, miBP, mMP, and ∑mPAEs showed significant negative associations with most of the down-regulated metabolites. In addition, urinary mEHHP, mBP, BPAF, BPS, and BPA were significantly associated with several serum metabolites, whereas the others (i.e., mECPP, mCMHP, mEP, BPF, and ∑BPs) showed no associations with screened metabolic biomarkers.

4. Discussion

In this study, based on high-throughput non-targeted metabolomics, 19 screened serum metabolic biomarkers, mostly related to galactose metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism, were significantly different between T2DM and control groups. More than half of urinary mPAEs, including mEOHP, mEHP, ∑mDEHP, mCPP, miBP, mMP, and ∑mPAEs, were significantly associated with most screened metabolic biomarkers and urinary BPAF, BPS, and BPA were Table 3

Urinary mPAEs and peak intensity of screened metabolites were log-transformed.

only significantly associated with several screened serum metabolites, such as L-arginine, L-histidine, L-citrulline, CMP, and pyridoxal. T2DM cases and controls matched in age, sex, and BMI were included in the present study to avoid the influence of age, sex, and BMI differences on metabolite profiles. In both groups, urinary levels of mPAEs were much higher than bisphenols, suggesting higher human exposure to PAEs than bisphenols. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the metabolites of DEHP were significantly correlated with each other in both T2DM cases and controls, confirming that these metabolites originated from the same parent compound. Compared to controls, more correlations between mPAEs were observed in case group, suggesting that there may be some common sources (such as medication containing PAEs) for PAE exposure in T2DM cases. A total of 19 differential metabolites in serum were screened between T2DM cases and controls. Among these metabolites, six metabolites related to galactose metabolism, including sucrose, raffinose, galactitol, galactinol, myo-inositol, and alpha-D-glucose, were significantly up-regulated in T2DM cases. Other eleven metabolites are related to amino acid metabolism (such as arginine biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, and histidine metabolism) and pyrimidine metabolism. In addition, the remaining two metabolites, riboflavin and pyridoxal, are involved in riboflavin metabolism and vitamin B6 metabolism, respectively. T2DM is a chronic metabolic disease with the hyperglycaemia because the body cannot use insulin efficiently. In the present study, it was found that along with alpha-D-glucose, several other metabolites involved in galactose metabolism (i.e., sucrose, raffinose, galactitol, galactinol, and myo-inositol) were significantly up-regulated in T2DM cases, which was highly consistent with the characteristics of T2DM. At present, some epidemiological studies have also provided evidence that serum or plasma hexoses were associated with increased risk of T2DM. Amino acids, as a class of important gluconeogenic precursors, are closely linked to glucose metabolism and can influence the insulin and glucagon secretion. In the present study, increased levels of L-glutamate, argininosuccinic acid, and L-asparagine and decreased levels of L-arginine, L-histidine, and L-citrulline were found in serum of T2DM cases. Of these amino acids, L-arginine, argininosuccinic acid, and L-citrulline are involved in arginine biosynthesis. N-Formimino-L-glutamate | Mrcanat

Fig. 3. Network graph for the perturbation of screened metabolic biomarkers related to amino acid metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism under the condition of T2DM (The red circles and the blue circles represented the up-regulated and down-regulated metabolites, respectively.) (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Fig. 3, L-arginine plays an important role in urea cycle. Firstly, L-ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate are converted to L-citrulline in the mitochondria of liver. Subsequently, L-citrulline and L-aspartate are incorporated to argininosuccinic acid in the cytosol. Then, argininosuccinic acid is broken into L-arginine and fumarate. Finally, L-arginine is hydrolyzed to form urea and L-ornithine by arginase. Hence, in the serum of T2DM cases, the decreased levels of L-arginine may be attributed to the down-regulated L-citrulline and up-regulated argininosuccinic acid. In addition, L-arginine is implicated in endothelial function. In endothelial cells, L-arginine, as a substrate, can be oxidized to produce L-citrulline and nitric oxide (NO) that regulates vascular tone and cardiovascular homeostasis. Studies have indicated that exposure the vasculature to glucose intolerance could induce endothelial dysfunction, further leading to the progression of insulin resistance and DM. The diminished synthesis of NO or the increased production of reactive oxygen species may be contributed to impaired endothelial function. At the same time, animal and clinical studies have identified that L-arginine supplementation could not only enhance insulin secretion, but also improve insulin sensitivity to regulate glucose homeostasis. The L-arginine/NO/adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway may be related to the improvement of impaired insulin sensitivity. A follow-up study has reported that in comparison with those in normoglycemic women, the levels of plasma L-arginine in women with gestational DM significantly decreased, being similar to our results. Inversely, in western countries subgroup, L-arginine was significantly positively related to risk of T2DM in a meta-analysis for the associations between metabolic signatures and T2DM. The discrepancy in the results may be attributed to the differences in the studied populations. Similar to L-arginine, L-citrulline, as the precursor of L-arginine and NO, could also decrease the levels of fasting blood sugar in patients with T2DM. Mechanism studies have suggested that L-citrulline could increase insulin sensitivity through decreasing serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and increasing insulin-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). Besides, L-citrulline supplementation could improve oxidative stress, which has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes, by decreasing levels of malondialdehyde and increasing total antioxidant capacity in serum of patients with T2DM. At present, few epidemiological studies have reported the associations between L-citrulline levels and risk of T2DM.

In line with the present study, the studies by Fikri et al. and Burzynska-Pedziwiatr et al. showed significantly decreased levels of L-histidine in plasma of subjects with T2DM or gestational DM, compared to normoglycemic population. Similarly, the association between L-histidine and decreased risk of T2DM was also reported in an integrative analysis. Clinical and in vitro studies have indicated that L-histidine could improve insulin resistance through suppressing inflammation, which is possibly mediated by nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway. As shown in Fig. 3, asparagine synthase catalyzes the conversion of L-glutamine and L-aspartate to L-asparagine and L-glutamate in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner. In comparison with controls, significantly increased levels of L-glutamate and L-asparagine in serum of T2DM groups was found in the present study, being in agreement with the prior studies. In addition, significant positive associations of L-glutamate with insulin resistance, fasting blood glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin were reported by Cheng et al. and Long et al. An animal study using mice showed significantly decreased concentrations of plasma glucose with knockdown of asparagine synthase in livers, indicating the possible influence of L-asparagine on. glucose homeostasis. L-glutamate has been reported to contribute to the glucagon release in islet α cells and insulin secretion inhibition in islet β cells.

In particular, disturbed pyrimidine metabolic pathway in T2DM cases was observed in our study. Compared to controls, deoxycytidine was down-regulated and orotate, dihydrouracil, thymidine, and CMP were up-regulated in serum of T2DM groups. Pyrimidine metabolic pathway contains the processes such as nucleotide biosynthesis, degradation, and salvage. For pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, L-aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate are converted to N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate. N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate is further catalyzed to generate dihydroorotate. Subsequently, dihydroorotate is converted to orotate. Orotate and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) are then incorporated to orotidine monophosphate (OMP), which is subsequently converted to uridine monophosphate (UMP). UMP is the precursor of uridine triphosphate (UTP), cytidine triphosphate (CTP), deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP), and deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), which are the basic unit of nucleic acid. For the catabolism of pyrimidine, cytidine is firstly converted to uridine that is subsequently catalyzed to generate uracil. Uracil is then reduced to dihydrouracil, which is finally oxidized to ammonia, carbon dioxide, and β-alanine. Similar to uridine, thymidine is gradually converted to ammonia, carbon dioxide, and β-aminoisobutyrate. In the present study, the increased levels of orotate, dihydrouracil, CMP, and thymidine indicated decreased anabolism and enhanced catabolism of pyrimidine nucleotide in T2DM groups. At present, few studies have reported perturbation of pyrimidine metabolic pathway in patients with T2DM. A study reported that compared to control subjects, people with metabolic syndrome showed significant alteration in pyrimidine metabolic pathway. In diabetic mice, enhanced pyrimidine metabolism was observed in kidney. Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), as the major metabolic pathway coupled with glycolysis, which can be disturbed by hyperglycaemia, can produce the starting materials (i.e., ribose 5-phosphate) for nucleotide biosynthesis. Hence, the disturbed pyrimidine metabolism may be related to PPP. In return, the disturbed pyrimidine metabolism may affect the activity of insulin and glucose homeostasis through influencing related gene transcription. However, the exact molecular mechanism for the association between pyrimidine metabolism and risk of T2DM is still unclear and worth studying in future.

In addition, other two disturbed pathways, riboflavin metabolism and vitamin B6 metabolism, were involved in T2DM in our study. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FMN and FAD are the cofactors of some flavoproteins and involved in the respiratory chain as hydrogen carrier, playing important roles in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and ketone bodies. The up-regulated riboflavin levels in T2DM groups may affect glucose metabolism through possible disturbance on the production of FMN and FAD. There are several different forms of vitamin B6, including pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, 4-pyridoxic acid, pyridoxine 5′-phosphate, pyridoxal 5-′ phosphate (PLP), and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate. PLP, as cofactor, is involved in amino acid metabolism by transamination, deamination, and decarboxylation. At present, studies have reported that lower PLP levels could lead to diabetes and higher PLP levels could reduce glucose concentrations. There was a hypothesis that PLP may improve insulin sensitivity by controlling expression of the gene related to adipogenesis.

In our previous case-control study on the total population, urinary levels of mEHHP, mEOHP, mEHP, ∑mDEHP, mCPP, miBP, mMP, and ∑mPAEs were significantly associated with increased risk of T2DM, whereas negative associations of mECPP and mCMHP with T2DM and no significant associations of mBP and mEP with T2DM were observed. At the same time, although the present study showed nearly no significant associations for urinary mECPP, mCMHP, mBP, mEP, and mEHHP with screened metabolic biomarkers related to T2DM, more than half of urinary mPAEs (i.e., mEOHP, mEHP, mCPP, miBP, mMP, and ∑mPAEs) were mostly significantly positively associated with up-regulated screened metabolic biomarkers and negatively associated with down-regulated screened metabolic biomarkers in multiple linear analyses. Taken together, these findings indicated that exposure to PAEs may contribute to elevated risk of T2DM by disturbing galactose metabolism, amino acid metabolism (especially arginine biosynthesis and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism), and pyrimidine metabolism. Metabolites, as the final products of gene regulation and protein expression, can reflect the phenotype and function of body, which can also reversely affect the genetic transcription and protein expression. Therefore, PAEs may be related to the differential metabolites through affecting related genetic transcription and protein expression in the aforementioned metabolic pathways, subsequently contributing to the progression of T2DM. Emerging evidence has demonstrated disorders in amino acids metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism (including pyrimidine and purine) after exposure to PAEs. In line with the present study, increased nucleic acid degradation products, especially pyrimidine metabolites (including thymine, uridine and ureidopropionate), were associated with higher urinary mPAE levels, indicating increased nucleic acid turnover and/or impaired nucleotide salvage. In addition, perturbation of the urea cycle involved in arginine biosynthesis has been reported to be associated with low-level PAE exposure in a Chinese male cohort. By combining transcriptomics with proteomics, a study on HepaRG cells has shown that co-exposure to PAEs and heavy metals could contribute to disturbed urea cycle through influencing the expression of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamoylase, argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinate lyase, and arginase.

Different from mPAEs, although, in our prior case-control study, urinary BPAF and BPF showed significant positive associations with risk of T2DM and BPA was also significantly positively related to T2DM in the lower levels, only several associations between urinary bisphenols and screened serum metabolites were observed in the present study, indicating that galactose metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism may be not involved in the association for exposure to bisphenols with risk of T2DM. The different results suggested that there were different toxic mechanisms for PAEs and bisphenols related to risk of T2DM. At present, few studies have explored the roles of metabolism for the associations between exposure to bisphenols and risk of T2DM. Hence, additional research is needed to clarify the roles of metabolism and underlying mechanisms.

The roles of metabolism in the associations for exposure to PAEs and bisphenols with risk of T2DM were explored for the first time based on high-throughput non-targeted metabolomics. Different from most previous studies, T2DM cases and controls were classified according to levels of fasting glucose and HbA1c in our study, which avoided the possible interference from people with prediabetes. In addition, T2DM cases and controls matched in age, sex, and BMI were selected for metabolomics analysis to eliminate the influence of metabolic differences induced by age, sex, and BMI. However, there are some limitations. A single-pot urine measurement for mPAEs and bisphenols may not represent the long-term exposure levels of PAEs and bisphenols due to the short half-lives of PAEs and bisphenols in human. Additionally, although multiple covariates were adjusted for the associations of urinary mPAEs and bisphenols with screened metabolic biomarkers in the linear regression models, there may be other confounders related to metabolomics differences, such as medication use, diet intake, and the existence of other diseases. Moreover, because of the nature of cross-sectional study, the causal relationships between PAE exposure and serum metabolome were not concluded. Thus, prospective studies are needed in future to verify the roles of metabolism and underlying. ## Conclusions

In summary, based on high-throughput non-targeted metabolomics, 19 serum metabolic biomarkers were screened between T2DM and control groups, mostly related to galactose metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism. More than half of urinary mPAEs, including mEOHP, mEHP, ∑mPAEs, ∑mDEHP, mCPP, miBP, mMP, and were mostly significantly positively associated with up-regulated screened metabolic biomarkers and negatively associated with down-regulated screened metabolic biomarkers in multiple linear analyses. Combined with the positive associations between aforementioned mPAEs in urine and risk of T2DM in our previous study, our findings indicated that exposure to PAEs may contribute to risk of T2DM through disturbing galactose metabolism, amino acid metabolism (especially arginine biosynthesis and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism), and pyrimidine metabolism. Different from PAEs, no evident results suggested the roles of metabolism in the associations between exposure to bisphenols and risk of T2DM.
