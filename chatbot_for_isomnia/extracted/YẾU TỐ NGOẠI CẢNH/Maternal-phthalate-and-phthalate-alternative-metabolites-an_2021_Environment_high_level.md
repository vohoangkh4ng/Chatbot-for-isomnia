# Title: Maternal phthalate and phthalate alternative metabolites and urinary biomarkers of estrogens and testosterones across pregnancy

## Summary: This article investigates the exposure of pregnant women to phthalates and their potential effects on estrogen and testosterone levels during pregnancy. The study recruited women aged 18-40 and analyzed urine samples to quantify various phthalate metabolites and their associations with urinary estrogen and testosterone biomarkers. Results indicated that certain phthalate metabolites were positively correlated with estrogen and testosterone levels, while negatively affecting the estrogen-to-androgen ratio. The findings suggest that phthalate exposure may influence hormonal changes during pregnancy, with specific associations varying by gestational age and fetal sex.
