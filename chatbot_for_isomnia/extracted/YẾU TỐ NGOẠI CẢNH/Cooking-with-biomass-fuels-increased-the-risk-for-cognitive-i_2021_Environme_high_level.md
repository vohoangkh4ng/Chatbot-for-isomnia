# Title: Cooking with biomass fuels increased the risk for cognitive impairment and cognitive decline among the oldest-old Chinese adults (2011â€“2018): A prospective cohort study

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between cooking with biomass fuels and cognitive impairment and decline in older Chinese adults. Utilizing data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, the research found that cooking with biomass fuels is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and decline. The study highlights that switching from biomass to clean fuels can reduce this risk and improve cognitive scores. Additionally, the findings indicate that cooking without proper ventilation further exacerbates cognitive risks, particularly among those with irregular exercise habits or living alone.
