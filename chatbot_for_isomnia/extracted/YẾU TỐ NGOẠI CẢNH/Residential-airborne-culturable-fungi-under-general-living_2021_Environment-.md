## Background
Residential airborne fungi may present obvious risk to human health. However, many countries do not recognize the necessarily need to control residential airborne culturable fungi (RAF). In China, few systemic investigations have been conducted to illustrate the distribution of residential airborne fungi and identify the association between indoor influencing variables and RAF under general living scenario in China.

## Objective
This study aimed to investigate RAF with the on-site research of 12 typical cities in China, and provided the latest characteristics and potential influencing factors of RAF under general living scenario.

## Methods
We measured RAF and investigated residential characteristics in 12 typical cities in China, 2018. At least 50 resident families were randomly selected both from downwind and upwind districts in each city with pre-proposed requirements. The RAF were sampled by the six-stage Anderson impactor. PM2.5 and PM10 were monitored by calibrated light-scattering dust meters. CO and CO2 were monitored by non-dispersive infrared analyzer method. NO2 was determined by Saltzman method. General linear model was used to evaluate the association between RAF exposure and residential characteristics with adjustment for potential confounders.

## Results
The RAF concentrations ranged from 0 to 9371 CFU/m3 with a median concentration of 396 CFU/m3. The median concentrations of RAF in the warm season were statistically higher than the cold season in Panjin, Qingdao, Lanzhou and Luoyang, but lower than the cold season in Shijiazhuang, Ningbo and Nanning. RAF in the bedrooms were more than the living rooms in all cities except Xi’an. Temperature and humidity had an inter-active effect on the RAF (OR = 1.0006, 95% CI: 1.0005, 1.0006). Some residential environmental pollutants, including PM2.5 (OR = 0.9989, 95% CI: 0.9988, 0.9989), PM10 (OR = 0.9993, 95% CI: 0.9993, 0.9993), and CO2 (OR = 0.0236, 95% CI: 0.0230, 0.0243), were negatively correlated with RAF. CO (OR = 1.1450, 95% CI: 1.1433, 1.1467) and NO2 (OR = 1.0026, 95% CI: 1.0024, 1.0028) were positively correlated with RAF. Architectural characteristics (sunlight exposure, building history, longitude, latitude, total living area, living floor, distance from the road, house type, the layers of window glass and decoration), family-related information (income) and lifestyle behaviors (keeping pets, growing plants, cooking, using insecticide, burning incense, heating, using air conditioner and cleaning frequencies) were also significantly related with RAF.

## Conclusions
This study reported nation-wide baseline condition of RAF and related influencing factors under general living scenario with quantitative details, which are exceedingly promising for evidence-driven standard and reasonable control strategy of residential airborne culturable in China.

## 1. Introduction
Bioaerosols are defined as biological particles that are suspended in the air, hence, they can exist as bacteria, fungi, viruses, spores, and biological cell remnants (endotoxin or peptidoglycan). Fungi, which include yeasts and molds, are found almost everywhere in our daily life environment, both outdoors and indoors. The total number of airborne fungi likely represents the dominating component of indoor bioaerosol to which we are exposed, given that humans inhale about 10–25 m3 of air every day. L. Fan et al.

Airborne fungi are closely related to symptoms or effects such as eczema, allergies, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. As people spend most of their time (70%–90%) indoors, indoor airborne fungi may pose great risk to human health and the quality of life. It is considered that “sick house syndrome” and “building related illness” are partly caused by fungi, as well as by chemical substances in the broad sense.

Indoor airborne fungi is a bio-indicator of indoor air quality whose concentration appears to be associated with indoor building conditions and parameters, such as temperature and relative humidity, building characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, as well as outdoor concentration of airborne fungi. Guidelines for fungi in indoor air have existed since 1979, and then the American Industrial Hygiene Association has proposed guidelines outlining the safe maximum number of fungal spores in different indoor environments. However, China has not established air quality standards of residential airborne fungi in household buildings.

While there have been many studies focused on determining the concentration of airborne fungi by model, and monitoring the pathogenicity and allergies that may be hazardous to the exposed inhabitants, few studies have attempted to study the relative importance of these various factors (dwelling characteristics, family-related information, and lifestyle behaviors) to the total number of residential airborne fungi, and thus to address issues such as controlling the indoor airborne fungi. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the distribution of residential airborne culturable fungi (RAF) under general living scenario and to further identify influencing factors.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Sampling site

This study is part of the ongoing CIEHS 2018 (Chinese Indoor Environment and Health Surveillance 2018) project, which was initiated by the National Institute of Environmental Health (NIEH) of China CDC. Twelve typical cities in China were investigated to explore the representative levels, characteristics, and influencing factors of RAF. This is the first field study of the associations between RAF and residential characteristics in 12 cities in China. Twelve cities were mainly from the Northeast (Harbin and Panjin), Northwest (Lanzhou and Xi’an), Southwest (Mianyang), North (Shijiazhuang), East (Wuxi, Ningbo and Qingdao), Central (Luoyang), and South (Nanning and Shenzhen) of China. All those cities covered 180,800 km² with a household registered population of about 79 million (Table S1). At least 50 households were randomly selected in each city (25 households in each of the upwind district and downwind district). Recruitment criteria concerning the target households were as follows:
1. Families lived in the present apartment for more than 3 years and without plans to move away in the next 3 years;
2. Families had at least one child aged 6–7 years;
3. Families without member smoking;
4. Families included should not be engaging in occupations that are exposure to high concentrations of air pollutants. These occupations include traffic police officers, couriers, sanitation workers, coal miners.

The sampling order was unified in all households. To avoid bias caused by air pollutants and physical factors (temperature and humidity), we first sampled the culturable fungi using a six-stage Anderson impactor, and the collection should be transported to the laboratory as soon as possible after sampling. Then we measured the indoor temperature and humidity, and next we tested the chemical factors (PM2.5, PM10, CO, CO2, and NO2) in the households. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted. The number of on-site staff was controlled within 2 people, and working time was controlled within 1 hour. The sampling condition of each family was regulated with the following guidelines:
1) The doors and windows were pre-closed for 12 h before sampling;
2) Air conditioners, fans and other equipment that may interfere with airflow were all turned off during the sampling period;
3) The suggested sampling time was between 9 AM to 10 AM to avoid traffic peaks and indoor cooking;
4) Banned behaviors such as smoking indoors, and refused temporary visiting guests of all families were suggested to ensure that sampling was conducted in the general living circumstances;
5) Airborne fungi samplers were set as close to the room center as possible and the height of the measuring points were 1.2 meters above the ground;
6) Measuring points were not <0.5 meters from the wall.

Referenced to the examination methods of current recommended standards in China, the RAF were sampled by the six-stage Anderson impactor. This sampler was consisted of six stages according to their aerodynamic diameter: 0.65 ~ 1.1, 1.1 ~ 2.1, 2.1 ~ 3.3, 3.3 ~ 4.7, 4.7 ~ 7.0, and >7.0 um. Considering the detection limit of fungi and the complexity of indoor environment, each sampling point was sampled with airflow rate of 28.3 L/min and the sampling time was lasted to 10 min. Fungi collected by each stage were cultured in the Petri disk under the condition of 28◦C ± 2 ◦C for 3 days. Sabouraud agar was contained in the Petri disk with a diameter of 90 mm. The number of fungi with each petri dish was enumerated and calculated colony-forming units per cubic meter of air (CFU/m3) as below:

Total fungi count = Total count of the colony on six stages plates
28.3 L/min × 10 min × 10 3

Indoor air quality indicators in this study included temperature, humidity, PM2.5, PM10, et al. Indoor temperature and humidity were recorded by using a digital display thermometer. Particulate matter air sampler by quartz membranes was inconvenient in closed household with limited volume for this study, and the actual concentration of PM will decrease step by step because of the purification effect of membrane filter, not like atmospheric sampling outside the household. Therefore, we monitored PM2.5 and PM10 by calibrated light-scattering dust meters. CO and CO2 were monitored by non-dispersive infrared analyzer method. NO2 was determined by Saltzman method. The average value of 10 continuous monitoring values recorded on a 5-minute interval was taken as the final representative value for one site in the living room or bedroom. Approximately 3% of the total rooms were monitored repetitively as the parallel sites, and the sampling method had acceptable repeatability.

## 2.3. On-site questionnaire

Data regarding dwelling characteristics and family lifestyle habits were obtained from the on-site structured self-assessment questionnaire. Detailed information on the participant household environment was administered by trained interviewers and comprised information on dwelling characteristics, heating method, and home cleaning indicators. Informed consent forms were signed before the investigation. Finally, after accounting for data censoring and the lack of coordination of the families, a total of 642 families were identified to evaluate residential air pollution in 12 typical cities in China.

## 2.4. Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. RAF in the living room and bedroom were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples and Pearson correlation. The RAF concentration was treated as a continuous variable without normally distributed. Therefore, generalized linear model with Poisson connection function was used to examine associations of residential air fungal with influencing variables. Season as a dummy variable was controlled in the model. We estimated the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each potential risk factor. To correct the extreme value of RAF, we used the 95% quantile of the same city in the same season to take place of it. All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. Statistical analysis was carried out with the software using the R environment, version 3.6.3.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. The status quo of RAF of 12 cities in China, 2018

The status quo of RAF of 12 cities in China, 2018 was shown in Table 1. Total RAF concentrations ranged between 0 and 9371 CFU/m3 with a median of 396 CFU/m3. The bedroom with the highest RAF was in Luoyang (9371 CFU/m3) and the living room with the highest RAF was in Xi’an (8800 CFU/m3), and in the living room was 340 CFU/m3. If the World Health Organization’s and Singapore’s guidelines were taken as the reference (500 CFU/m3), RAF exceedance rate reached 64.10% in 12 cities. The highest exceedance rate was found in Luoyang with 96.08% in the bedroom and 95.10% in the living room. There was a positive correlation between RAF in the bedroom and the living room with Pearson correlation test (r = 0.599, P < 0.001). The RAF in the living room was positively correlated with the bedroom in each city except Xi’an. For all cities, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test of paired samples showed that the difference of RAF in the living room and bedroom was statistically significant (z = 2.776, P = 0.005), and RAF in the bedrooms were more than those in the living rooms. The distribution of RAF in cold and warm seasons was shown in Fig. 3. There were statistically significant differences of RAF between the warm season and cold season in Panjin, Shijiazhuang, Qingdao, Lanzhou, Luoyang, Ningbo, and Nanning. The medians of RAF in the warm season were higher than the cold season in Panjin, Qingdao, Lanzhou and Luoyang (P < 0.05), but lower than the cold season in Shijiazhuang, Ningbo and Nanning (P < 0.05).

Notes: SD, standard deviation; Min, minimum; P25, quartile; P50, median; P75, 75th percentile; Max, maximum; ESR, Exceeding Standard Rate.
*Exceeding standard rate (ESR) referred to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) and Singapore’s guidelines (500 CFU/m3), and the RAF more than 500 CFU/m3 was considered to exceed the standard.

seasons were summarized in Table 2. The RAF were positively correlated with indoor humidity (OR = 1.0002, 95% CI: 1.0000, 1.0003), CO (OR = 1.1450, 95% CI: 1.1433, 1.1467) and NO2 (OR = 1.0026, 95% CI: 1.0024, 1.0028), while the RAF were negatively correlated with residential temperature (OR = 0.9811, 95% CI: 0.9806, 0.9816), PM2.5 (OR = 0.9989, 95% CI: 0.9988, 0.9989), PM10 (OR = 0.9993, 95% CI: 0.9993, 0.9993) and CO2 (OR = 0.0236, 95% CI: 0.0230, 0.0243) of all indoor rooms. It was found that the direction of the correlation between airborne fungi and humidity in the living room and bedroom was not the same. The correlation between RAF and humidity was negative in the living room (OR = 0.9985, 95% CI: 0.9983, 0.9987), but positive in the bedroom (OR = 1.0019, 95% CI: 1.0017, 1.0021).
The study also found that temperature and humidity had an interactive effect on the RAF (OR = 1.0006, 95% CI: 1.0005, 1.0006). The relationships between temperature and humidity and their interactions with RAF were showed in Fig. 4. High and low temperature all contributed to the growth of RAF (Second column in Fig. 4). The RAF was at the lowest level when the temperature was approximately between 15 and 25 ◦C. On the other hand, humidity showed an overall positive correlation with RAF (First column in Fig. 4). The interaction graphs (Third column in Fig. 4) showed that interactions of temperature and humidity were significantly associated with higher RAF (the red lines in all figures show an upward trend), and the RAF were at the lowest level when the products of the humidity and temperature were controlled within a certain range (about <2000).

3.3. Correlations between RAF with building conditions, family-related information, and lifestyle behaviors

Overall, we observed relationships between RAF and influencing factors such as building conditions, family-related information, and lifestyle behaviors after controlling for the effect of seasons (Table 3). The lifestyle habit like cleaning the room had a different association with the RAF in the living room and bedroom, other building characteristics and lifestyle behaviors had similar effects on the RAF in different rooms. For the building conditions, households farther away from the road had more RAF (OR = 1.0779, 95% CI: 1.0762, 1.0796). Architectural characteristics showed potential influences on RAF, the RAF increased with the decreasing of daily sunlight hours (OR = 0.9522, 95% CI: 0.9499, 0.9544) and the increasing of building history years (OR = 1.0035, 95% CI: 1.0033, 1.0038). Moreover, RAF were found increased with increasing values of longitudes (OR = 1.0198, 95% CI: 1.0195, 1.0201) and latitudes (OR = 1.0263, 95% CI: 1.0260, 1.0267) of investigated residences in China. As the total living area of family members increased, the RAF decreased (OR = 0.9999, 95% CI: 0.9998, 0.9999). Besides, RAF in households were negatively correlated with the number of floors (OR = 0.9877, 95% CI: 0.9874, 0.9880). Compared with bungalows, RAF were lower in buildings (OR = 0.5463, 95% CI: 0.5400, 0.5526) and villa (OR = 0.6049, 95% CI: 0.5874, 0.6227). As to the layers of window glass, RAF with more than two layers were lower than those with less than two layers (OR = 0.8681, 95% CI: 0.8644, 0.8718). At the same time, RAF in undecorated households were more than in renovated households (OR = 1.2048, 95% CI: 1.1993, 1.2102).
Some family-related information and lifestyle habits also showed relationships with RAF. As for the influence of family economic status, compared with families with an annual total income of <50,000 CNY (roughly 7,600 USD), households with an annual income of 50,000 to 150,000 CNY (OR = 0.8117, 95% CI: 0.8075, 0.8158) and an income of more than 150,000 CNY (OR = 0.4959, 95% CI: 0.4930, 0.4988) had lower RAF. As for lifestyle habits, the study found that households without furry pets had lower RAF than those who keep furry pets (OR = 0.8930, 95% CI: 0.8875, 0.8984). And households that never grow plants had lower RAF than those that grow plants (OR = 0.9732, 95% CI: 0.9684, 0.9780). Moreover, the RAF in the families that never cook were significantly lower than those cooked (OR = 0.8723, 95% CI: 0.8661, 0.8785). The frequency of using insecticide was also correlated with RAF. The concentrations in households using insecticide sometimes (OR = 0.7183, 95% CI: 0.7085, 0.7281) and often (OR = 0.6862, 95% CI: 0.6748, 0.6976) were lower than those rarely using insecticide. Households never burn incense showed higher fungi concentrations than those burned (OR = 1.1368, 95% CI: 1.1298, 1.1438). Households without heating showed lower RAF than those with heating (OR = 0.9773, 95% CI: 0.9743, 0.9802). The households did not use air conditioner showed more RAF than households used air conditioners | Bedroom (CFU/m²) | Bedroom (CFU/m²) | Bedroom (CFU/m²) |

The median RAF concentration was 396 CFU/m3, which is lower than the upper limit (500 CFU/m3) in hygienic specification for public building in the WHO’s guideline (500 CFU/m3) published in 1990. Data collected from residences in Nara, Japan reported that airborne fungal concentrations were lower than 550 CFU/m3 in the living room and higher than 219 CFU/m3 in the bedroom, respectively. A study conducted in Shanghai, China, reported that the culturable fungi were 3184 CFU/m3 in the child’s bedroom and 3044 CFU/m3 in the living room, respectively, which is higher than our results. Researchers observed a lower residential apartments fungi concentration in Kazan (varied between 8 and 360 CFU/m3). Mazlan et al. found that 47 colonies of fungus from all sampling sites with 4 species of fungus during 24 hours in University Kebangsaan Malaysia. Although the guideline for the acceptable concentration of indoor airborne fungi differs from those of other countries, our findings indicated that concentrations of RAF in most of the studied residences were acceptable in 12 cities, China.

The results indicated that RAF concentrations were higher in the bedroom than in the living room, which was consistent with the findings of a study in Nagasaki city that airborne fungi in the living room and the bedroom were different. However, not all studies have found the difference between the living room and bedroom. A study from California found that fungal richness in the living room was not significantly different from bedroom. In our study, the doors were pre-closed for 12 hours for indoor sampling, the indoor Fig. 4. Fitting between RAF and temperature & humidity with/without interaction of 12 cities in China, 2018.

environment of the living room and the bedroom was relatively independent. Thus, our research found that the mean RAF concentration was higher in the bedroom than in the living room, which may be related to the smaller area of the bedroom. This finding also may indicate that RAF is more problematic in the bedroom. RAF concentrations were different in the warm season and cold season in 7 cities, while residential airborne fungi may have seasonal variations. These findings are consistent with several previous studies. However, the temperature and humidity were not exactly same in 12 cities. In Harbin, Wuxi and Shenzhen, RAF were not significantly different between warm and cold seasons. This phenomenon could be influenced by several combined factors because fungi are ubiquitous components of bioaerosols in different environments, where their quantitative and qualitative composition highly depends on distinct variables in time and space physical, chemical, and biological factors. The observed seasonal difference of RAF may in consequence with indoor temperature, relative humidity and air exchange rates. Residential fungal profiles in different cities were not very similar, which varied by season, temperature, humidity, and air exchange rates, which were modified by ventilation and occupant behaviors. Some researchers have detected that the genus Aspergillus showed the highest concentration in autumn, Penicillium was mostly found in cold season. The different urbanizations in each city also have large-scale effects on airborne fungal spore concentration.

4.2. The influence of residential environmental parameters and pollutants

This study confirmed the correlations between airborne fungi and environmental parameters (temperature and humidity). Sabariego et al. found that fungal growth favors damp homes with high humidity levels and cold surfaces onto which moisture can condense, and the quantity of spores is positively correlated to temperature and hours of sunlight. A study in four office buildings found that temperature was not significantly associated with airborne fungi concentrations, but RAF were negatively related to temperature in our study. This was perhaps related to the fact that temperature also influences fungal growth indirectly by interacting with water activity, temperature ranges indoors were optimum for most fungal growth, and humidity was related to temperature. It is not surprising that temperature did not have an independent correlation with total fungal counts. Our results were also robust to the adjustment of the collective effect of temperature and humidity. We found that temperature and humidity were significantly related to RAF, which is consistent with previously reported.

Until now, very few data were available regarding the relationships between RAF and indoor air pollutants. From our update investigation, the relationships between RAF and air pollutants were found to be similar to those previously reported between bacterial aerosols and air pollutants. A study conducted by Cao et al. reported that microorganisms had a positive correlation with PM pollution concentrations. Non-significant positive correlations were found between PM10 with Cladosporium outdoors. However, we found a slightly positive correlation between fungi and air pollutants. This phenomenon can be explained by the difference between indoors and outdoors sources of fungi. Humans are a major source of indoor fungi, and human-associated emissions of biological particles suggests that resuspension is more important than direct shedding, that biological emission rates can be related to particle size, surface loading, human activity and relative humidity.

The concentration of CO2 is a surrogate for people-generated pollutants and is an indicator of the adequacy of the rate of outside air supply. The higher concentration of CO2, represents the poorer ventilation and the greater the likelihood of elevated concentrations with other pollutants. After control other confounding factors, the increase in CO2 might lead to a decrease in airborne culturable fungi. Ramachandran et al. found a positive relationship between CO2 concentration and airborne fungi. However, our data supported Chao’s proposal that total fungal concentrations were negatively related to CO2 concentrations. CO2 is inversely related to the amount of outdoor air supply in the house-inside, if the number of family members and their activity levels remain constant. Table 3 (continued)

| Notes: CI, confidence intervals. P values for all factors in this table were less than 0.05. The variables marked with ’ref’ represented the reference variables in the statistical analysis. The value of OR indicates that the logarithm of the total residential airborne fungi concentration was OR times of the individual reference variable. The results of OR values were showed after controlling the effect of seasons. Northeast American county reported that fungal concentrations in basements were higher than in other rooms, which was attributed to high humidity. Some studies found that the total concentration of airborne fungi is significantly higher in small living area. These factors significantly associated with home dampness-related indicators especially may lead to a higher risk of mold spots and damp stains. Airborne fungi dispersal from the outdoor air dominated the signal of indoor air, and many of the common indoor fungi had a likely outdoor origin, such as Cladosporium and Alternaria species. This may explain the phenomenon found in this study that the distance from the road and window glass layers could have effect on RAF. Decoration may affect the growth of fungus through the type of material. Materials with high nutritional content, such as wallpaper, gypsum board, and so on, can satisfy the demand for fungi growth.

Family-related information such as household income is related to the residential airborne fungi, the family with annual income<50,000 CNY may have more airborne fungus concentration, which might be attributed to the poor health care awareness among this population. A study conducted in Turkey investigated the effects of fungi growth and found that the monthly income level has an association with total viable fungi.

Lifestyle behaviors including keeping furry pets and growing plants, cooking at home, no-burning incense, heating, rarely using insecticide, not using air conditioner and rarely room-cleaning may cause the growth of RAF. These lifestyle behaviors may significantly be associated with home dampness-related indicators, especially that the ground/top floors having a substantially higher risk of mold spots and damp stains. Several studies reported that the presence of dogs, cats or other furred pets affected the microbial composition of house dust. Our result was in agreement with previous studies and implied that pet-keeping increased the risk of the concentration of airborne fungi. All above results supported the assumptions that furred pets may continually release fungi through the skin, hairs, or fingernails to airborne, which may through the tracking of outdoor microbes to the indoors. Given that plants are quantitatively important sources of airborne fungi and can alter the microbiome of a built environment, it would be expected that grow plants would lead to relatively high numbers of airborne fungi. Regular cooking or burning incense was associated with higher airborne fungi. This phenomenon is probably due to increased particulate matter caused by cooking or incense. Correlations between airborne and fungi particulate matter were previously observed, so particulate matter may be an important carrier of fungus in the air. Additionally, indoor temperature and humidity were affected by cooking and heating, which may explain its effect on the observed indoor airborne fungi. Nevertheless, the number of investigations cooking, burning incense, or heating is limited, and further studies are necessary to confirm their impact on the composition of the airborne fungi indoors. Moreover, we pointed out that the use of insecticide was closely associated with the RAF. This may be related to the cytotoxicity of pesticides.

Spilak et al. reported the associations between residential airborne fungi and dwelling characteristics like room volume, which is consistent with our findings. A lower level of fungi or fungi spores after the air conditioner was switched on, which agreed with the similar correlation in our study. It may be explained by the fact that air condition system can filter against the airborne fungi. In another study, frequent vacuum was found to decrease the total indoor fungal propagules, and regular cleaning could prevent the accumulation of debris and particulate matter. Therefore, cleaning the rooms may remove the fungal in floor dust, which is a reservoir of residential airborne fungi. These findings seemingly suggest that people who are sensitive to mold should use masks and other protective equipment when performing activities such as cleaning and vacuuming, because these activities may spread fungal spores in the air.

### Limitations and advantages

This study had several limitations. First, selection bias and information bias are inevitable in cross-sectional studies, even though households were selected randomly in each city. Secondly, RAF were only sampled twice for each household, which may have low validity for evaluating long-term exposure levels in the residential environment. Thirdly, the study did not do isolation and identification of fungi. Influencing factors may have different effects on different types of fungi, so RAF need to be separated and incubated in future research. Lastly, the factors analyzed in this study may not fully cover all potential influencing factors because the sources and influences of residential fungi are very complex.

Nevertheless, this study has several strengths. Firstly, to our best knowledge, the present study is the first multicenter study, based on great labor and cost, on residential environment and airborne fungi using on-site inspection in China. The large sample size makes our results more believable, as well as more representative of residential environment in 12 cities. Secondly, during residential inspection, we formulated the sampling condition of each family to better simulate the general life scenario. Thirdly, we used cultivation-based methods of current recommended standards in China. Therefore, our results were credible and accurate for standard preparation.

### Conclusion

This study explored the status quo and the potential influencing factors of RAF of 642 families in 12 cities of China. The households had high RAF in China with a median of 396 (0 ~ 9371) CFU/m3. RAF in the bedrooms were positively correlated with and higher than the living rooms for most cities under general living scenario. RAF were negatively correlated with residential PM2.5, PM10 and CO2, but positively correlated with CO and NO2. Residential temperature and humidity showed obvious effects on RAF respectively, and had an interactive effect. Moreover, architectural-characteristics, family-related information, and lifestyle-behaviors may affect RAF. Effective measures should be taken to reduce the fungi loads to the barest minimum. An improvement plan for residential air quality was needed to push forward. Well-designed, well-constructed, and well-maintained building envelopes are critical to the prevention and control of excess fungi growth. Additional information and interventions to eliminate residential airborne fungi are urgently needed to guide healthier behavior in families. Declaration of Competing Interest
