# Title: Water temperature affects the biotransformation and accumulation of a psychoactive pharmaceutical and its metabolite in aquatic organisms

## Summary: This article investigates how water temperature influences the bioconcentration and biotransformation of the anxiolytic drugs temazepam and its metabolite oxazepam in aquatic organisms, specifically European perch and dragonfly larvae. The study reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce the bioconcentration of temazepam in perch and enhance the production of oxazepam, while dragonfly larvae show no temperature dependency in bioconcentration or detectable biotransformation. The findings highlight the varying impacts of temperature on pharmaceutical exposure in different aquatic species within the same ecosystem.
