Systematic review
Meta-analysis

**Background:**
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease and Injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates), supported by a large number of individual experts. Evidence from previous reviews suggests that exposure to long working hours may cause depression. In this article, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating (if feasible) the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from depression that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.

**Objectives:**
We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41–48, 49–54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35–40 h/week), on depression (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality).

**Data sources:**
We developed and published a protocol, applying the Navigation Guide as an organizing systematic review framework where feasible. We searched electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including the WHO International Clinical Trial Registers Platform, Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CISDOC and PsycInfo. We also searched grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews; and consulted additional experts.

**Study eligibility and criteria:**
We included working-age (≥15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (aged <15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41–48, 49–54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35–40 h/week), on depression (prevalence, incidence and/or mortality).

**Study appraisal and synthesis methods:**
At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined odds ratios using random-effects meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project.

**Results:**
Twenty-two studies (all cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 109,906 participants (51,324 females) in 32 countries (as one study included multiple countries) in three WHO regions (Americas, Europe and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with a clinical diagnostic interview (four studies), interview questions about diagnosis and treatment of depression (three studies) or a validated self-administered rating scale (15 studies). The outcome was defined as incident depression in all 22 studies, with first time incident depression in 21 studies and recurrence of depression in one study. We did not identify any study on prevalence of depression or on mortality from depression. For the body of evidence for the outcome incident depression, we had serious concerns for risk of bias due to selection because of incomplete outcome data (most studies assessed depression only twice, at baseline and at a later follow-up measurement, and likely have missed cases of depression that occurred after baseline but were in remission at the time of the follow-up measurement) and due to missing information on life-time prevalence of depression before baseline measurement.

Compared with working 35–40 h/week, we are uncertain about the effect on acquiring (or incidence of) depression of working 41–48 h/week (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.29, 8 studies, 49,392 participants, I2 46%, low quality of evidence); 49–54 h/week (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21, 8 studies, 49,392 participants, I2 40%, low quality of evidence); and ≥ 55 h/week (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24, 17 studies, 91,142 participants, I2 46%, low quality of evidence).

Subgroup analyses found no evidence for statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences by WHO region, sex, age group and socioeconomic status. Sensitivity analyses found no statistically significant differences by outcome measurement (clinical diagnostic interview [gold standard] versus other measures) and risk of bias (“high”/“probably high” ratings in any domain versus “low”/“probably low” in all domains).

**Conclusions:**
We judged the existing bodies of evidence from human data as “inadequate evidence for harmfulness” for all three exposure categories, 41–48, 48–54 and ≥55 h/week, for depression prevalence, incidence and mortality; the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects of the exposure. Producing estimates of the burden of depression attributable to exposure to long working appears not evidence-based at this point. Instead, studies examining the association between long working hours and risk of depression are needed that address the limitations of the current evidence.

## 1. Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are producing the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease and Injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates). The organizations are estimating the numbers of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) that are attributable to selected occupational risk factors. The WHO/ILO Joint Estimates are based on already existing WHO and ILO methodologies for estimating the burden of disease for selected occupational risk factors. They expand these existing methodologies with estimation of the burden of several prioritized additional pairs of occupational risk factors and health outcomes. For this purpose, population attributable fractions – the proportional reduction in burden from the health outcome achieved by a reduction of exposure to the risk factor to zero – are being calculated for each additional risk factor-outcome pair, and these fractions are being applied to the total disease burden envelopes for the health outcome from the WHO Global Health Estimates for the years 2000–2016. The WHO/ILO Joint Estimates may include estimates of the burden of depression attributable to exposure to long working hours, if feasible, as one additional risk factor-outcome pair whose global burden of disease has not previously been estimated. To select parameters with the best and least biased evidence for our estimation models, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the relationship between exposure to long working hours and depression according to our protocol, and we present its results in the current paper. A systematic review of studies estimating the prevalence of exposure to long working hours is ongoing and applies novel systematic review methods. WHO and ILO have conducted or are conducting several other systematic reviews and meta-analyses on other additional risk factor-outcome pairs. To our knowledge, these are the first systematic reviews and meta-analyses (with a pre-published protocol) conducted specifically for an occupational burden of disease study. An editorial provides an overview of this series of systemic reviews and meta-analyses from the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates and outlines its scientific, methodological, policy, editorial and other innovations. The WHO/ILO joint estimation methodology and the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates are separate from these systematic reviews, and they are described in more detail and reported elsewhere. WHO/ILO Joint Estimates have just been published of the global, regional and national burdens of ischemic heart disease and stroke attributable to exposure to long working hours for 194 countries for the years 2000, 2010 and 2016.

1.1. Rationale

To consider the feasibility of estimating the burden of depression attributable to exposure to long working hours, and to ensure that potential estimates of burden of depression are reported in adherence with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER), WHO and ILO require a systematic review of studies on the prevalence of relevant levels of exposure to long working hours, as well as a systematic review and meta-analysis with estimates of the relative effect of exposure to long work hours on depression prevalence, incidence and mortality, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (the systematic review presented here). The theoretical minimum risk exposure level is the exposure level that would result in the lowest possible population risk, even if it is not feasible to attain this exposure level in practice. These data and effect estimates should be tailored to serve as parameters for estimating the burden of depression from exposure to long work hours in the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.

We are aware of at least three prior systematic reviews on the effect of long working hours on depression published since 2015. First, Theorell et al., reported, based on six cohort studies of high or moderate quality, that there was a prospective association of long working hours (denoted as “long working weeks” by the authors) with risk of onset of depressive symptoms. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, they assessed the evidence as “limited” for women and “very limited” for men. The authors refrained from upgrading the evidence level for long working hours, because they found the estimates of the association between long working hours and depression neither consistent, nor large enough, for qualifying for an upgrade; they also did not conduct a meta-analysis of the included effect estimates. Second, Watanabe et al., examined overtime work and risk of onset of depressive disorders and identified seven cohort studies. The meta-analysis conducted in this systematic review showed an increased, but not statistically significant, association between working ≥50 h/week and risk of depressive disorders (relative risk (RR) 1.24, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.75). Third, Virtanen et al., included in their meta-analysis ten published cohort studies and 18 unpublished cohort studies with individual-participant data, yielding 31 study-specific estimates (as three studies of the published studies had provided estimates stratified by sex). The outcome was named “depressive symptoms” and included both measures of clinical depression and depressive symptoms and of psychological distress. The overall pooled estimate for the association of long working hours with risk of onset of “depressive symptoms” was an odds ratio (OR) of 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.25). The association was stronger in studies from Asian countries (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.01), weaker in European studies (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.22), and absent in North American studies (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29) and in the one study from the Western Pacific (Australia only) (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29). When stratified by “depression” (including clinical depression and depressive symptoms) versus psychological distress, the pooled ORs were 1.09 (0.94 to 1.26) and 1.18 (1.06 to 1.32) for clinical depression/depressive symptoms and psychological distress, respectively. Meta-regressions did not show any statistically significant differences in the estimates for clinical depression, depressive symptoms and psychological distress. In summary, the previous systematic review and meta-analytic evidence appears to be inconclusive with regards to the outcome of depression. To our knowledge, prior systematic reviews did not have a pre-published protocol and/or missed other essential aspects of a systematic review. Our systematic review is fully compliant with latest systematic review methods (including use of a pre-published protocol) and expands the scope of the existing systematic review evidence by covering evidence from studies published up to 28 November 2019.

Our systematic review covers workers in the formal and in the informal economy. The informal economy is defined as “all economic activities by workers and economic units that are – in law or in practice – not covered or insufficiently covered by formal arrangements.” It does not comprise “illicit activities, in particular the provision of services or the production, sale, possession or use of goods forbidden by law, including the illicit production and trafficking of drugs, the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, trafficking in persons and money laundering, as defined in the relevant international treaties.” Work in the informal economy may lead to different exposures and exposure effects than work in the formal economy does. Consequently, formality of work (informal versus formal economy) may modify the effect of long working hours on depression. Therefore, we consider in the systematic review the formality of the economy reported in included studies.

1.2. Description of the risk factor

Burden of disease estimation requires unambiguous definition of the risk factor, risk factor levels and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. Long working hours are defined as working hours exceeding standard working hours, i.e. any working hours of >40 h/week (Table 1). Based on results from earlier studies on long working hours and health endpoints, the preferred four exposure level categories for our systematic review are 35–40, 41–48, 49–54 and ≥55 h/week (Table 1).

The theoretical minimum risk exposure is standard working hours defined as 35–40 h/week (Table 1). We acknowledge that it is possible that the theoretical minimum risk exposure might be lower than standard working hours, but we have to exclude working hours < 35 h/week, because studies indicate that some persons working less than standard hours do so because of existing health problems or family care obligations. In other words, persons working less than standard hours might belong to a Table 1

health-selected group or a group concerned with family care and therefore cannot serve as comparators. Consequently, if a study used as the reference group persons working less than standard hours or a combination of persons working standard hours and persons working less than standard hours, it was excluded from the systematic review and meta-analysis. The category 35–40 h/week is the reference group used in many large studies and in the most recent systematic review by Vir-tanen et al.

1.3. Definition of the outcome

The WHO Global Health Estimates group outcomes into standard burden of disease categories, based on standard codes from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10). The relevant WHO Global Health Estimates category for this systematic review is “II.E.1 Major depressive disorders”. In line with the WHO Global Health Estimates, we define the health outcome covered in this systematic review as depression, defined as conditions with ICD-10 codes F32, F33 and F34.1. Table 2 presents for each disease or health problem included in the WHO Global Health Estimates category the inclusion in this systematic review, showing that this review covers all the relevant categories.

of the hypothalamic–pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis, inflammation processes, circadian disruptions, and sleep impairment. As possible confounders, we consider age, sex and socioeconomic position (also denoted as socioeconomic status, SES); we assume that these variables may impact both exposure to long working hours and risk of depression. It is well established that women and persons with low SES have a higher risk of depression than men and persons with high SES. With regard to age, some studies indicate that the 12-month prevalence of depression is modestly higher in young adulthood than in middle adulthood, although birth cohort effects may also play a role, with a higher prevalence of depression in more recent birth cohorts. Age, sex and SES may also be related to number of working hours, although the direction of these relationships may depend on other variables and contextual factors; thus, it appears reasonable to regard these three variables as potential confounders for the association of exposure to long working hours with depression. We addressed this possible confounding by including only studies in the meta-analysis that had adjusted or stratified for age, sex and SES or had been based on study samples that were homogenous with regard to these criteria (e.g., included only men or only individuals from the same occupational group). It is possible that age, sex and SES are not only confounders, but also effect modifiers for the association of long working hours and depression, and we consequently conducted meta-analyses stratified by age, sex and SES. We further considered as effect modifiers country, industrial sector, occupation and formality of the economy and also conducted meta-analyses stratified by these variables, if data allowed this.

1.4. How the risk factor may impact the outcome

Fig. 1 presents the logic model for our systematic review of the causal relationship between exposure to long working hours and depression, taken from our protocol. This logic model is an a priori, process-orientated one that seeks to capture the complexity of the risk factor–outcome causal relationship. Based on knowledge of previous research on long working hours and depression, we assume that the effect of long working hours on risk of depression may be mediated via (a) disturbance of work/life balance; (b) exhaustion; (c) emotional distress; (d) health-related behaviors, such as lack of physical activity, high alcohol consumption and reduced sleeping hours; and (e) psycho-physiological changes, such as activation.

| F34.1      | Dysthymia                               | Yes                     |

2. Objectives

To systematically review and meta-analyse evidence on the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41–48, 49–54 and ≥55 h/week) on depression prevalence, incidence and mortality among workers of working age, compared with the minimum risk exposure level (standard working hours: 35–40 h/week).

3. Methods

3.1. Developed protocol

We applied the Navigation Guide methodology for systematic reviews in environmental and occupational health as our guiding methodological framework wherever feasible. The guide applies established systematic review methods from clinical medicine, including standard Cochrane methods for systematic reviews of interventions, to the field of environmental and occupational health to ensure systematic and rigorous evidence synthesis on environmental and occupational risk factors that reduces bias and maximizes transparency. The need for further methodological development and refinement of the relatively novel Navigation Guide has been acknowledged. From the perspective of the Navigation Guide framework, all steps were conducted for the R. Rugulies et al.

Fig. 1. Logic model of the possible causal relationship between exposure to long working hours and depression

We registered the protocol in PROSPERO under CRD42018085729. The protocol adheres to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols statement (PRISMA-P), with the abstract adhering to the reporting items for systematic reviews in journal and conference abstracts (PRISMA-A). Any modification of the methods stated in the protocol was registered in PROSPERO and reported in the systematic review itself. Our systematic review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (PRISMA). Our reporting of the parameters for estimating the burden of depression attributable to exposure to long working hours in the systematic review adheres with the requirements of the GATHER guidelines, because the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates that may be produced consecutive to the systematic review must also adhere to these reporting guidelines.

## 3.2. Searched literature

### 3.2.1. Electronic academic databases
We searched the seven following electronic academic databases:
1. WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 18 July 2018)
2. Ovid MEDLINE with Daily Update (1 January 1946 to 11 July 2018)
3. PubMed (1 January 1946 to 11 July 2018)
4. EMBASE (1 January 1947 to 11 July 2018)
5. Web of Science (1 January 1945 to 11 July 2018)
6. CISDOC archived database (1 January 1901 to 17 July 2018)
7. PsycINFO (1 January 1880 to 12 July 2018)

The Ovid MEDLINE search strategy was presented in the protocol. The full search strategies for all databases were revised by a research librarian and are presented in Appendix 1 in the Supplementary data. We performed searches in electronic databases operated in the English language using a search strategy in the English language. When we neared completion of the review, we conducted a top-up search of the MEDLINE database on 28 November 2019 to capture the most recent publications (e.g., publications ahead of print). Deviations from the proposed search strategy and the actual search strategy are documented in Section 8.

### 3.2.2. Electronic grey literature databases
We also searched the two following grey literature databases.

- OpenGrey (http://www.opengrey.eu/) (up to 25 July 2018) 3.4.1. Types of populations
We included studies of the working-age population (≥15 years) in the formal and informal economy. Studies of children (aged <15 years) and unpaid domestic workers were excluded. Participants residing in any Member State of WHO and/or ILO and any industrial setting or occupation were included. Exposure to long working hours may potentially have further population reach (e.g., across generations for workers of reproductive age), and we acknowledge that the scope of our systematic review does not capture these populations and impacts on them.

3.4.2. Types of exposures
We included studies that defined exposure to long working hours in accordance with our standard definition (Table 1). We prioritized measures of the total number of hours worked, including in both of: main and secondary jobs, self-employment and salaried employment, whether in the informal or the formal economy. We included studies with objective (e.g., by means of time recording technology) or subjective measurements of long working hours, including studies that used measurements by experts (e.g. scientists with subject matter expertise) and self-reports by the worker, workplace administrator or manager. If a study presented both objective and subjective measurements, then we prioritized objective ones. Studies with measures from any data source, including registry data, were included. For studies that reported exposure levels differing from our standard levels (Table 1), we converted the reported levels to the standard levels if possible and reported analyses on these alternate exposure levels if impossible.

3.4.3. Types of comparators
The included comparators were participants exposed to the theoretical minimum risk exposure level: worked 35–40 h/week (Table 1). We excluded all other comparators.

3.4.4. Types of outcomes
This systematic review included three outcomes:
1. Has depression (or, in other words, depression prevalence).
2. Acquired depression (depression incidence).
3. Died from depression (depression mortality).

We included studies that defined depression in accordance with our standard definition (Table 2). Other affective disorders (e.g., bipolar disorders) were excluded. We did not expect documented ICD-10 diagnostic codes in most studies examining exposure to long working hours and its effect on depression, but expected that depression was assessed with other methods.
The following measurements of depression were regarded as eligible, as described in the protocol:
i. Psychiatric diagnostic interview.
ii. Diagnosis by a physician, psychologist or other qualified health professional.
iii. Hospital admission or discharge record.
iv. Administrative data (e.g., disability pensioning with the diagnosis of depression).
v. Register data of treatment for depression with one or both of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy (this measurement was only included if there was documentation that the treatment was for depression specifically, and not for other disorders).
vi. Self-administered rating scale for depression that was previously validated against a clinical measure of depression and that dichotomized respondents into cases versus non-cases (e.g., Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) R. Rugulies et al.
Environment International 155 (2021) 106629

### 3.4.5. Types of studies
We included studies that investigated the effect of exposure to long working hours on depression for any study years and capturing any period of years. Eligible study designs were randomized controlled trials (including parallel-group, cluster, cross-over and factorial trials), cohort studies (both prospective and retrospective), case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies (including quasi-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies). We included a broader set of observational study designs than is commonly included, because a recent augmented Cochrane Review of complex interventions identified valuable additional studies using such a broader set of designs. As we have an interest in quantifying risk and not in qualitative assessment of hazard, we excluded all other study designs (e.g., uncontrolled before-and-after, cross-sectional, qualitative, modelling, case and non-original studies). Records published in any year and any language were included. Again, the search was conducted using English language terms, so that records published in any language that present essential information (i.e. title and abstract) in English were included. If a record was written in a language other than those spoken by the authors of this review or those of other reviews in the series (i.e., Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, French, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Thai), then the record was translated into English. Published and unpublished studies were included. Studies conducted using unethical practices were excluded (e.g., studies that deliberately exposed humans to a known risk factor to human health).

### 3.4.6. Types of effect measures
We included measures of the relative effect of a relevant level of exposure to long working hours on the risk of depression (prevalence, incidence and mortality), compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. We included relative effect measures such as RRs, ORs or hazard ratios; however, all studies we identified reported ORs. Measures of absolute effects (e.g., mean differences in risks or odds) were converted into relative effect measures, but if conversion was impossible, they were excluded. We had aimed to convert OR into RR, however, this was for most studies not possible, as we were unable to extract information on the absolute risk of depression in the non-exposed. We therefore reported ORs and combined these effect estimates in the meta-analyses.

### 3.5. Extracted data
A standard data extraction form was developed and trialled until data extractors reached convergence and agreement. At least two review authors independently extracted data on study characteristics (including study authors, study year, study country, participants, exposure and outcome), study design (including study type, comparator, epidemiological model(s) used and effect estimate measure) and risk of bias (including source population representation, blinding, exposure assessment, outcome assessment, confounding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, conflict of interest and other sources of bias). A third review author resolved conflicts in data extraction. Data were entered into and managed with Excel. We also extracted data on potential conflict of interest in included studies. For each author and affiliated organization of each included study record, we extracted their financial disclosures and funding sources. We used a modification of a previous method to identify and assess undisclosed financial interest of authors. Where no financial disclosure or conflict of interest statements were available, we searched the name of all authors in other study records gathered for this study and published in the prior 36 months and in other publicly available declarations of interests.

### 3.6. Requested missing data
We requested missing data from the principal study author by email or phone, using the contact details provided in the principal study record. If we did not receive a positive response from the study author, we sent follow-up emails twice, at two and four weeks. We present a description of missing data; the study author from whom the data were requested; the dates of requests sent; the date on which data were received (if any); and a summary of the responses provided by the study authors. If we did not receive some or all of the requested missing data, we nevertheless retained the study in the systematic review as long as it fulfilled our eligibility criteria.

### 3.7. Assessed risk of bias
Standard risk of bias tools do not exist for systematic reviews for hazard identification or those for risk assessment in occupational and environmental health. The five such tools developed specifically for occupational and environmental health are for either or both hazard identification and risk assessment, and they differ substantially in the types of studies (randomized, observational and/or simulation studies). R. Rugulies et al.

and data they seek to assess (e.g., human, animal and/or in vitro) studies using the I2 statistic. If two or more clinically homogenous studies were found to be sufficiently homogenous statistically to be combined in a meta-analysis, we pooled the ORs of the studies in a quantitative meta-analysis, using the inverse variance method with a random effects model to account for cross-study heterogeneity. The meta-analysis was conducted in RevMan 5.3. We neither quantitatively combined data from studies with different designs (e.g. did not combine cohort studies with case-controls studies), nor did we combine unadjusted with adjusted models. We only combined studies that we judged to have a minimum acceptable level of adjustment for the three core confounders we had identified at protocol stage.

If quantitative synthesis was not feasible (for instance, due to different exposure levels as defined above), we synthesised the study findings narratively and identified the estimates that we judged to be the highest quality evidence available.

We assessed risk of bias on the individual study level and across the body of evidence for each outcome. The nine risk of bias domains included in the Navigation Guide method for human data were:
(i) source population representation;
(ii) blinding;
(iii) exposure assessment;
(iv) outcome assessment;
(v) confounding;
(vi) incomplete outcome data;
(vii) selective outcome reporting;
(viii) conflict of interest;
(ix) other sources of bias.

Risk of bias or confounding ratings for all domains were: “low”; “probably low”; “probably high”; “high”; or “not applicable”. To judge the risk of bias in each domain, we applied a priori instructions, which we adapted from an ongoing Navigation Guide systematic review and further described in our protocol. For example, a study was assessed as carrying “low” risk of bias from source population representation, if we judge the source population to be described in sufficient detail (including eligibility criteria, recruitment, enrolment, participation and loss to follow up) and the distribution and characteristics of the study sample to indicate minimal or no risk of selection effects.

All risk of bias assessors jointly trialled the application of the risk of bias criteria until they had synchronized their understanding and application of these criteria. Two or more study authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study by outcome. Where individual assessments differed, a third author resolved the conflict. For each included study, we reported our risk of bias assessment at the level of the individual study by domain in a standard ‘Risk of bias’ table. For the entire body of evidence, we presented the study-level risk of bias ratings by domains in a ‘Risk of bias matrix’.

3.8. Synthesised evidence (including conducted meta-analysis)

We conducted separate meta-analyses for all outcomes: Has depression, Acquired depression, and Died from depression. If we found two or more studies with an eligible effect estimate, at least two review authors independently investigated the clinical heterogeneity of the studies in terms of participants (including country, sex, age and occupation or industrial sector), level of risk factor exposure, comparator and outcomes, following our protocol. If we found that effect estimates differed considerably by WHO region, sex and/or age, or a combination of these, then we synthesised evidence for the relevant populations defined by WHO region, sex and/or age, or combination thereof. If we found effect estimates to be clinically homogenous across WHO regions, sex and age groups, we combined studies from all of these populations into one pooled effect estimate that could be applied across all combinations of WHO regions, sexes and age groups in the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.

If we judged two or more studies for the relevant combination of WHO region, sex and age group, or combination thereof, to be sufficiently clinically homogenous to potentially be combined using quantitative meta-analysis, we tested the statistical heterogeneity of the studies.

3.10. Assessed quality of evidence

We assessed the quality of evidence using a modified version of the Navigation Guide quality of evidence assessment tool. The tool is based on the GRADE approach adapted specifically to systematic reviews in occupational and environmental health. An overview of GRADE and a discussion of its applicability to environmental health research has been presented.

At least two review authors assessed the quality of evidence for the entire body of evidence by outcome, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. We adapted the latest Navigation Guide instructions for grading the quality of evidence and presented the adapted instructions in our protocol. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the following five GRADE considerations:
(i) risk of bias;
(ii) inconsistency that cannot be explained (or, in other words, “unexplained heterogeneity”);
(iii) indirectness;
(iv) imprecision;
(v) publication bias.

These considerations were downgrades if they could not be If our systematic review had included ten or more studies, we generated an Egger’s funnel plot to judge concerns regarding publication bias.

We graded the quality of the entire body of evidence by outcome, using the three Navigation Guide standard quality of evidence ratings: “high”, “moderate” and “low”. Within each of the relevant domains, we rated the concern for the quality of evidence, using the ratings “none”, “serious” and “very serious”. As per Navigation Guide, we started at “high” for randomized studies and “moderate” for observational studies. Quality was downgraded for no concern by nil levels (0), for a serious concern by one level (-1) and for a very serious concern by two levels (-2). We upgraded the quality of evidence for the following other reasons: (i) large magnitude of effect; (ii) presence of a dose–response relationship; and (iii) the plausibility that potential residual confounding cannot explain the effect. There had to be compelling reasons to downgrade or upgrade. If we had a serious concern for risk of bias in a body of evidence consisting of observational studies (level), but had no other concerns, and had no reasons for upgrading, then we downgraded the quality of evidence by one level from “moderate” to “low”.

There is an additional step that is described in the protocol that integrates the quality of the evidence (the method for assessing it was described above) with other elements, including the direction of the effect, the confidence in the effect and other compelling attributes of the data that may influence our certainty to allow for an overall rating that consists of “sufficient evidence of harmfulness”, “limited of harmfulness”, “inadequate of harmfulness” and “evidence of lack of harmfulness” based on human evidence. This approach to evaluate only the human evidence has been applied in previous systematic reviews and verified by the United States of America’s National Academy of Sciences. It also provides two steps that integrate Bradford Hill considerations (i.e., evaluating the quality of the evidence, and then evaluating the overall strength of evidence). Finally, the GRADE quality of evidence ratings (which are the same as for Navigation Guide) are analogous to the final ratings from Bradford Hill for causality.

## Results

### Assessed strength of evidence

Our systematic review included studies of human data only and no studies of non-human data. The standard Navigation Guide methodology allows for rating human and non-human animal studies separately, and then combining the strength of evidence for each stream for an overall strength of evidence rating. However, the Navigation Guide also allows for rating one stream of evidence based on the domains described above (i.e., risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency that cannot be explained, imprecisions, publication bias, large magnitude of effect, dose–response and residual confounding) to arrive at an overall rating of the quality of evidence as ‘high’, ‘moderate’ or ‘low’. The approach of evaluating only the human evidence stream is consistent with the GRADE methodology that has adopted the Bradford Hill considerations. So, using the method above based on the Navigation Guide incorporates the considerations of Bradford Hill.

| Strength      | Strength of association and imprecision in effect estimate | Strength of association and imprecision in effect estimate |
| Consistency   | Consistency across studies, i.e., across different situations | Consistency across studies, i.e., across different situations |

| Analogy       | Existing association for critical outcomes leads to not downgrading the quality, indirectness | Existing association for critical outcomes leads to not downgrading the quality, indirectness. Evaluating the overall strength of body of human evidence allows consideration of other compelling attributes of the data that may influence certainty. |

Of the total of 25,550 individual study records identified in our searches, 13 study records reporting results from 22 individual studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria, and these 22 studies were included in the systematic review. This included ten journal articles providing results from ten studies and one systematic review article providing results from 18 unpublished studies, of which ten fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The remaining eight studies from the review were excluded, because their outcome was not depression but distress or they assessed depression with an unvalidated rating scale. Further, we included results from an unpublished manuscript and from an analysis we conducted of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth open access database. We excluded 397 study records after full-text screening. For the 40 excluded studies that most closely resembled the included studies, the reasons for their exclusion are listed in Appendix 3. In addition, there were three studies that provided insufficient information for determining their eligibility. We tried to contact the study authors for missing data to screen these studies for eligibility but did not receive the requested missing data. These three studies are therefore classified as “studies awaiting classification” in the flow chart, and their characteristics are briefly described in Appendix 4 in the Supplementary data.

Of the 22 studies included in the review, 17 studies were included in one or more quantitative meta-analyses, whereas five studies were not included in any meta-analysis. Of these five studies, two studies used a comparator that was substantially different from our standard comparator, and the authors of these studies could not provide us with a re-analysis with a different comparator. Further, we excluded the study because it was based on the same study population as the included study by Ahn. We prioritized the study by Ahn et al., because it was more recent and because the author responded to our request. Table 4

request for re-analysis of the data. Finally, we excluded the studies by Dembe and Yao and Virtanen et al. from the meta-analyses, because these two studies were based on the same study population as the NLSY open access database cohort that we analysed (NLSY OA Cohort, 2019). We prioritized the open access data analysis over the published analyses by Dembe and Yao and Virtanen et al. because in our analyses we could apply all of the standard exposure categories as described in our protocol.

4.2. Characteristics of included studies

The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 5.

4.2.1. Study type
All 22 included studies were cohort studies, with 21 being prospective and one being retrospective in design. Of the 22 studies, all examined risk of acquiring depression, with 21 studies examining first onset of depression and one study recurrence of depression among participants who had reported a previous depression but who were free from depression at the time of the baseline assessment. The effect estimates reported in all studies were ORs for an eligible category of exposure to long working hours, compared with standard working hours (or a similar comparator). All studies adjusted for our three pre-specified confounders.

4.2.2. Population studied
The 22 included studies captured 109,906 workers (51,324 females and 58,582 males). Twenty-one studies included both female and male workers, whereas one study included male workers only. The age range was from 17 to 71 years. When studies reported a mean age, this was most often in the 40s. By WHO region, most studies examined populations in the Americas (nine studies of two countries) followed by Europe (eight studies, including seven studies of five countries, plus one study combining data from 28 countries), followed by the Western Pacific (five studies of three countries). The most commonly studied countries were the United States of America (six studies), Canada (three studies), and Australia, Denmark, the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (two studies each). Only one study provided a detailed breakdown by occupation and industrial sector. Five studies provided limited information on occupation, industrial sector or both, and one study included only one specific occupational group (i.e., nurses). The other studies did not provide information on industrial sector or occupation.

4.2.3. Exposure studied
All studies measured exposure to long working hours by self-report, either by pen-and-paper-survey, face-to-face-survey, telephone survey, an interview (unclear if face-to-face or telephone) or did not specify which of these methods were used. No included study used non-self-reported measures, such as official or company records of hours worked. Only two of the 22 included studies provided the standard exposure categories that we had predefined in the protocol. We therefore attempted to contact all study authors asking them to either provide us with the original data or conducting a re-analysis of the data using our standard exposure categories. The author of one study provided us with the original data, and the authors of three studies re-analysed the data according to our request, yielding a total of six studies providing the standard exposure categories.

2014; Kim et al., 2016; Shields, 1999; Virtanen et al., 2012) and all ten unpublished studies from the Virtanen et al. review reported effect estimates for exposure categories that we regarded as similar enough to our standard exposure categories. One study provided exposure categories (i.e., 35.5–37.5 h/week and > 37.5 h/week) that we judged as non-comparable to our standard exposure categories, because these exposure categories included values of our standard comparator (35–40 h/week).

4.2.4. Comparator studied
Nineteen studies used the standard comparator of 35–40 h/week, including the four studies that were re-analysed on our request. Of the remaining three studies, one study used a comparator that we judged as similar (30–40 h/week). Two studies used a comparator that we judged as non-comparable to the standard comparator, because the comparator either included very low working hours (1–35 h/week) that may indicate reduced work ability and existing health problems, or working hours of 1–50 h/week that included both very low working hours and working hours that overlapped with our standard exposure categories.

4.2.5. Outcomes studied
Of the three outcomes included in this systematic review, we found no eligible study for the following two outcomes:
- “Has depression” (depression prevalence); and
- “Died from depression” (depression mortality).

Of the 22 studies, all 22 studied the outcome “Acquired depression” (depression incidence), 21 studies capturing the incidence of first onset of depression and one study investigating acquiring depression again (recurrence of depression).
Acquiring depression was measured using:
- A self-administrated rating scale in 15 studies. Table 5

## 4.2.6. Statistical modelling

All 22 studies adjusted or stratified for the three key potential confounders (i.e., sex, age and SES), and most studies adjusted for further variables, for example marital status, cohabitation or children living at home. When studies provided multiple statistical models with different adjustments, we aimed for selecting estimates that were adjusted for as many confounders as possible while not being adjusted for potential mediation. See Appendix 5 in the Supplementary data for a description of our rationale for selecting specific estimates from the included studies. For six studies, we conducted re-analyses of the original data, giving us control over the statistical modelling.

## 4.3. Risk of bias at individual study level

We assessed risk of bias based on the information we retrieved from the included study records and additional records on the included studies. For the ten previously unpublished studies presented in the systematic review, risk was assessed based on both information provided by the systematic review and information from previous publications on the cohorts and datasets analysed by the systematic review. This systematic review only included evidence on one eligible outcome: “Acquired depression” (depression incidence). The risk of bias rating for each domain for all 22 included studies for this outcome are presented in Fig. 3. The justification for each rating for each domain by included study is presented in risk of bias tables in Appendix 6 in the Supplementary data.

### 4.3.1. Selection bias (not representing source population)

We rated the risk of this selection bias as probably low for 19 studies and as probably high for three studies. We rated the risk of bias as probably low, because the studies comprised large populations of working-age individuals and all studies described their sample criteria extensively, enabling comparisons with the source population. Response rates differed considerably between the studies, however, a low response rate in a cohort study does not necessarily indicate a high risk of bias of the observed association between the exposure and the outcome; it first and foremost means that results cannot necessarily be generalized to the source population, although this has been controversially debated. Under certain circumstances, non-response can introduce bias, such as when selection out of the study is differential by exposure status; thus, we cannot rule out bias, but we judged the risk of bias as overall probably low. There are three exceptions, though: the studies by Berthelsen et al. (2015), Dembe and Yao (2016) and by Wang et al. (2012b). Berthelsen et al. (2015) deliberately did not exclude individuals with depression at baseline, but instead adjusted for baseline depression scores in the analyses. While this adjustment is likely to have reduced bias in the analyses, we are still concerned that individuals with prevalent depression may have been selected into specific working time arrangements. Dembe and Yao (2016) measured exposure as working hours per week, averaged over the whole 32-year observation period. Depression was not assessed at the beginning of the study, but at some point during the study. Thus, several measures of working hours were collected at a time when some individuals might have already had a depression. It is possible that these individuals had been selected into jobs with specific work time arrangements due to their depression, and that these individuals were at increased risk of being diagnosed with depression during follow-up. Consequently, we rated this study as being of probably high risk of bias. Wang et al. (2012b) examined risk of recurrent depression in a cohort of individuals who had a lifetime history of depression but were free of depression at the time of the baseline measurement. It is likely that frequency and severity of past depressive episodes differed in this cohort, and it is possible that individuals with more frequent or more severe previous depressive episodes were both selected into specific work time arrangements and at increased risk of being diagnosed with a recurrent depression during follow-up. Consequently, we rated this study as of probably high risk of bias.

### 4.3.2. Performance bias

We rated the risk of this bias as probably low for all 22 studies. In experimental studies, such as clinical trials, knowledge about assignment to either intervention or control group may influence behaviour or reporting of participants and can therefore severely bias results. This is of lesser concern in the observational studies included in this review, where participants were not assigned to a treatment or control group but first reported information about exposure and health conditions, then were categorized by researchers into different exposure groups and then were followed-up for assessing incidence of the outcome. We cannot rule out bias, as for example it is possible that individuals sensing that the study might be about working hours and health may over- or underreport numbers of working hours, but we regard the likelihood of this possible risk of bias to be low. None of the studies reported whether study personnel, such as statisticians conducting the analyses, were blinded to the exposure and/or outcome status of the participants. But even if they were unblinded, we doubt that this would have influenced the statistical analyses or reporting.

### 4.3.3. Detection bias (exposure assessment)

We rated the risk of this bias as probably low for 19 studies, and as probably high risk for three studies. Working hours were recorded in all studies by self-report by the workers; no study used “more objective” measures such as administrative records. We are not concerned about bias here, as we assume that individuals, who are free of depression, are able to estimate their weekly working hours reasonably accurately. This assumption is supported by results from a study. For three studies, though, we rated the risk of this bias as probably high, because it was possible that some participants in these studies either had a current depression or an incomplete recovery from a previous depression when they reported their weekly working hours. This might have introduced bias, as there is evidence that individuals with depression tend to overestimate the adversity and negativity of their environment. Berthelsen et al. (2015) deliberately did not exclude individuals with depression at baseline, but instead adjusted for baseline depression scores in the analyses. While this adjustment is likely to have reduced bias in the analyses, we are still concerned with self-reported working hour assessments of individuals with prevalent depression. Dembe and Yao (2016) included measures of working hours over 32 years, including several years before they assessed depression, and therefore did not know the depression status of their participants at the time of some of the exposure assessments. Wang et al. (2012b) examined recurrence of depression among participants with a lifetime history of depression. Although participants with a current depressive episode at baseline were excluded from the analyses, it is possible that incomplete recovery from a previous depressive episode may have affected both the reporting of hours worked at baseline and the risk of depression during follow-up. 4.3.4. Detection bias (outcome assessment)
We rated the risk of this bias as low for four studies, probably low for 14 studies and probably high for four studies. The four studies rated as having low risk of bias all used the gold standard method for assessing depression in epidemiological studies: a clinical diagnostic interview. The 14 studies rated as of probably low risk of bias either used a self-administered rating scale that had previously been validated against clinical measures of depression or conducted a comprehensive interview with the participants to identify diagnosis or treatment of depression that was then coded into ICD-9 codes. Of the four studies rated as probably high, two used a simple question to assess if the participants ever had a doctor-diagnosed depression, and we were concerned that several cases of depression were missed with this rather crude method to recall episodes of depression. The two other studies rated as of probably high risk of detection bias were the Virtanen et al., 2018 – HRS study and the Virtanen et al., 2018 – SLOSH study from the systematic review by Virtanen et al. For the Virtanen et al., 2018 – HRS study, it was stated that the outcome measure of this study was “depressive symptoms” without naming the instrument. From our knowledge of the study, we assume that the instrument used was the CES-D, but as we cannot be sure and, having indirect evidence only, we rated this study as of probably high risk of bias in this domain. For the Virtanen et al., 2018 – SLOSH study, it was stated that the outcome measure of this study was “depressive symptoms” measured with the “Symptom Check List, SCL”. From our knowledge of this study, we assume that the instrument used was the SCL-CD6, but as we cannot be sure and, having indirect evidence only, we rated this study as having probably high risk of detection bias. Other psychosocial work environment factors could not only be confounders or mediators but also be effect modifiers, i.e. it is possible that the interaction of exposure to long working hours with other psychosocial work environment factors would cause a stronger or a weaker effect on risk of depression. In the job strain model, it is assumed that high psychological demands in combination with high job control would not be health-hazardous but rather health-beneficial, because this combination would enhance learning and feelings of mastery. The combination of high psychological demands with low job control, on the other hand, would inhibit learning, cause strain and ultimately be health-hazardous. Empirically, it has indeed been shown that high psychological demands in themselves are not associated with risk of depression, whereas the combination of high psychological demands and low job control is associated with a higher risk of depression. Similarly, it is conceivable that long working hours in combination with low job control, but also in combination with other psychosocial work environment factors (e.g., low leadership quality or high role conflicts), could have a stronger effect on risk of depression than without these other factors. If this was the case, then our decision not to adjust for other psychosocial work environment factors would remain the correct decision, because adjusting for an effect modifier would give biased results. The appropriate approach would have been to test for interaction, however, this was beyond the scope of this review.

4.3.5. Confounding
We rated the risk of confounding as low for two studies, probably low for 19 studies and probably high for one study. We rated the studies by Ahn and Berthelsen et al. as carrying low risk of confounding, because it controlled for all first-tier confounders (i.e., age, sex and SES) and also for all second-tier confounders (i.e., job group, industry and country), either by adjusting, stratifying or study design (e.g., only including employees from a specific job group into the study), as we had prespecified in our protocol. The 19 studies rated as of probably low risk of confounding adjusted for all first-tier confounders but not all second-tier confounders. The one study rated as probably high risk in this domain adjusted for all first-tier and some second-tier confounders, but also further adjusted for a measure of work stress (job strain), which we regard as over-adjustment. One of the components of job strain is high psychological demands, which might conceptually overlap with exposure to long working hours. Further, it seems reasonable to assume that exposure to long working hours can cause the experience that work is highly psychologically demanding, which would make high psychological demands a potential mediator, a step in the causal pathway, for the association between working long hours and risk of depression. Adjusting for a mediator would introduce bias into the analyses; we therefore rated the study by Shields as having high risk of confounding. However, if our assumption that exposure to long working hours would cause the work to be highly psychologically demanding was wrong, and instead highly psychologically demanding work would cause long working hours (e.g., because working long hours would be a way to handle high psychological demands at work) and, if further, high psychological demands at work would increase risk of depression, then high psychological demands would be a potential confounder for the association between exposure to long working hours and risk of depression. In this case, our decision to rate the study by Shields as of high risk of confounding would have been wrong. Further, in this case, our a priori decision to select, if possible, estimates that were not adjusted for high psychological demands or other psychosocial work environment factors would also have been wrong, and the estimates we selected would have been at risk of being confounded. We were aware of this when we wrote the protocol of the systematic review and made the conscious decision to assume that other psychosocial work environment factors, including psychological demands, are mediators rather than confounders. We acknowledge that this assumption can be contested.

4.3.6. Selection bias (incomplete outcome data)
We rated the risk of this bias as probably low for four studies and probably high for 18 studies. Depression is often, although not always, episodic and self-limiting with a high recurrence rate. This constitutes a challenge for epidemiological research. A cohort study measuring depression at baseline and some years later at follow-up, will not be able to identify those episodes of depression that occurred after baseline but were no longer present at the time of the follow-up measurement. This is of particular concern in those studies that measured depression at follow-up with a self-administered rating scale that asked about symptoms of depression during the last one or two weeks only. Consequently, we rated the 15 studies using a self-administered rating scale and the two studies using a simple question about doctor-diagnosed depression as of probably high risk of selection bias due to incomplete outcome data. One study used a clinical diagnostic interview covering depressive episodes during the last 12 months, and this study was also rated as of probably high risk of bias, because the follow-up period was very long. As carrying low risk of this selection bias, we rated studies that used a clinical diagnostic interview with a relatively short follow-up period.

4.3.7. Bias due to selective outcome reporting
We rated this bias as of low risk for all 22 studies. None of the included studies had a pre-specified study protocol, but all the studies’ outcomes were reported in the results sections of the study record as outlined in the methods sections.

4.3.8. Conflict of interest
We rated all 22 studies as of low risk of this bias, as we did not find any indication of a conflict of interest. More specifically, the studies:

- Did not receive support from a company or other entity with a financial interest in the study findings;
- Were funded by public research agencies or related organizations that were free from commercial interests in the study findings;
- Were authored only by persons who were not affiliated with companies or other entities with vested interests; and/or;
- Had no conflict of interest declared by study authors.

### Other risk of bias
We identified one additional potential risk of bias that applied to 19 of the 22 studies, that is a probably high risk of bias due to lacking information on episodes of depression earlier in the life preceding the time of baseline assessment of depression. While we are confident that 19 of the 22 studies did not include individuals with a prevalent depression at baseline, we are not confident that most studies were able to identify depression episodes that occurred during the lifetime before baseline assessment. This is a problem, because if there was a depressive episode before baseline assessment, the outcome of the study would change from “acquired depression for the first time in life” (first time incident depression) to “acquired depression again” (recurrent depression). Whether the association between a risk factor (e.g., exposure to long working hours) and depression is different for first time incidence of depression and recurrent depression is difficult to estimate. This may depend on various factors, such as the severity of the first depression; if the first depression was treated or not; the time span between the first and the recurrent depression; or whether there was only one depressive episode or multiple depression episodes before the measurement of the recurrent depression in the study. Thus, that studies were not able to measure lifetime depression prior to baseline assessment does not necessarily mean that estimates were biased, but we judged this as indirect evidence for potential bias and consequently rated the risk of bias as being probably high. As having probably low risk of bias, we rated the studies by Kim et al. that used comprehensive interviews to assess previous diagnosis and treatment for depression, and Wang et al. that assessed lifetime prevalence of depression with a clinical diagnostic interview. Also for these three studies it is possible that previous depression episodes were missed, either because they were not diagnosed or treated or because individuals had forgotten about earlier episodes of depression in the assessment of life-time prevalence; however, we assessed this risk as probably low. Two studies used a simple question to assess life-time depression before baseline. Although such a question is superior to not assessing life-time depression at all, we are still concerned that this is not sufficient for measuring lifetime depression; consequently we rated these two studies also as of probably high risk of this other bias.

### Synthesis of results
This systematic review only included evidence on one eligible outcome: “Acquired depression” (depression incidence). We report findings from the three eligible comparisons included in this systematic review.

#### Comparison: worked 41–48 h/week compared with worked 35–40 h/week
A total of eight studies with 49,392 participants reported effect estimates on the risk of acquiring depression when working 41–48 h/week, compared with working 35–40 h/week. These studies were somewhat heterogeneous in their definition of the exposure category and/or the comparator. Six studies used the standard exposure categories, as defined in our protocol, and two studies (providing three estimates) used exposures categories that were non-standard but judged by us as similar enough for combining them in the meta-analysis. The non-standard exposure categories were >40 h/week compared with 35–40 h/week and 45 h/week compared with 35–40 h/week, respectively. Despite these definitional differences in exposure, we judged these studies to be sufficiently homogenous to be combined in one meta-analysis. The eight studies reported nine eligible effect estimates, with one study providing two estimates: one each for women and men. Fig. 4 depicts the forest plot for this meta-analysis of these eight included studies. We retained all nine individual effect estimates in the forest plot (rather than combining the effect estimates for women and men from the same study). Compared with working 35–40 h/week, working 41–48 h/week had similar odds of acquiring a depression when followed up between 1 and 10 years (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.29, eight studies with nine estimates, 49,392 participants, I2 46%). When we excluded the one study on recurrent depression, the pooled estimate remained virtually unchanged (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.29, seven studies with eight estimates, 48,997 participants, I2 52%). When comparing the estimates from the six studies using the standard exposure categories to the estimates from the two studies using approximated exposure categories, we did not find a statistically significant difference (p = 0.81).

Fourteen of the 22 studies from this review were not included in this meta-analysis. The ten studies from the Virtanen et al. review were not included, because they only reported estimates for exposure categories for ≥55 h/week. The study by Berthelsen et al. was not included, because it used as the comparator all working hours of ≤35 h/week and used as exposures weekly working hours of 35.5–37.5 and >37.5, respectively. The study by Kato et al. was not included, because it used as the comparator all working hours of ≤50 h/week and used as exposures working hours of 50.1–60 h/week and ≥60 h/week. The study by Dembe and Yao was not included, because it was based on the same study population as the NLSY OA Cohort that was included. Dembe and Yao reported odds ratios of 0.96, 1.04 and 0.82 for 41–50 h/week, 51–60 h/week and >60 h/week, respectively, compared with 30–40 h/week. Kim et al was not included, because it was based on the same study population as Ahn that was included. Kim et al. reported odds ratios of 0.92, 1.09 and 1.92 for 41–52 h/week, 53–68 h/week and >68 h/week, respectively, compared with 35–40 h/week.

#### Comparison: worked 49–54 h/week compared with worked 35–40 h/week
A total of eight studies with 49,392 participants reported effect estimates on the risk of acquiring depression when working 49–54 h/week, compared with working 35–40 h/week. These studies were also somewhat heterogeneous in their definition of the exposure category and/or the comparator. Six studies used the standard exposure categories, which we had defined in the protocol. Two studies (providing three estimates) used exposures categories that were non-standard but judged as sufficiently similar to combine them in the meta-analysis. The non-standard exposure categories were >40 h/week compared with 35–40 h/week and 50 h/week compared with 35–40 h/week.

Fig. 4. Main meta-analysis, Acquired depression, worked 41–48 h/week compared with worked 35–40 h/week.

The eight studies reported nine eligible effect estimates, with one study providing two estimates, namely one each for women and men. Fig. 5 depicts the forest plot for this meta-analysis of the eight included studies. We retained all nine individual effect estimates in the forest plot. Compared with working 35–40 h/week, working 49–54 h/week had similar odds of acquiring a depression when followed up between 1 and 10 years (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21, eight studies with nine estimates, 49,392 participants, I² 40%). When we excluded the one study on recurrent depression, the pooled estimate also remained virtually unchanged (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.19, seven studies with eight estimates, 48,997 participants, I² 32%).

When comparing the estimates from the six studies using the standard exposure categories with the estimates from the two studies using approximated exposure categories, we did not find a statistically significant difference (p = 0.54).

Fourteen of the 22 studies included in this systematic review were not included in this meta-analysis. The ten studies from the review by Virtanen et al. were not included, because they only reported estimates for exposure categories for ≥55 h/week. Berthelsen et al. was not included, because this study used as the comparator all working hours of ≤35 h/week and as exposure categories working hours of 35.5–37.5 per week (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.92–2.06) and >37.5 per week (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.62–1.75), respectively. Kato et al. was not included because it used as the comparator all working hours of ≤50 h/week and as exposures working hours of 50.1–60 h/week (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.70–1.86) and ≥60 h/week (OR 4.04, 95% CI 1.68–9.75). The Dembe and Yao study was not included, since it was based on the same study population as the NLSY OA Cohort that was included. Dembe and Yao reported odds ratios of 0.96 (95% CI 0.80–1.15), 1.04 (95% CI 0.79–1.38) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.50–1.35) for 41–50 h/week, 51–60 h/week and >60 h/week, respectively, when compared with 30–40 h/week. Kim et al. was not included, because it was based on the same study population as Ahn that was included. Kim et al. reported odds ratios of 0.92 (95% CI 0.75–1.12), 1.15 (95% CI 0.89–1.48), 1.17 (95% CI 0.82, 1.68) for 41–50 h/week, 51–60 h/week and >60 h/week, respectively, when compared with 30–40 h/week.

### Additional analyses

#### Subgroup analyses
We conducted subgroup analyses for the comparison between the group that worked ≥55 h/week and the group that worked 35–40 h/week. These analyses include subgrouping by WHO region, sex, age and SES (Table 6). For the subgroup analysis by WHO region, data were available for all studies from the main analysis (n = 17), whereas the subgroup analyses could only be performed for selected studies by sex (n = 6), age (n = 5) and SES (n = 5). We could not perform subgroup analyses by occupation, industrial sector or formality of the economy, because we did not identify any studies that provided estimates disaggregated by these subgroups. None of the subgroup analyses showed a statistically significant difference between the subgroups (all p values ≥0.31). Thus, pooled effect estimates did not differ statistically significantly between WHO regions, women and men, different age groups or different SES groups. Some of the subgroup analyses yielded estimates that appeared to be considerably higher than the estimate from the main analysis. However, such a comparison has to be made with caution for those subgroup analyses that were conducted with selected studies (i.e., sex, age and SES). For example, the subgroup analysis stratified by sex that was based on six studies yielded OR estimates that were higher for both women (1.15, 95% CI: 0.76–1.75) and men (1.21, 95% CI: 1.01–1.44) than the pooled OR estimate from the main analysis (1.08, 95% CI: 0.94–1.24) that was. 4.5.2. Sensitivity analyses
We conducted two pre-defined sensitivity analyses (Table 7). One sensitivity analysis compared estimates for studies that had assessed depression with the gold standard method (a clinical diagnostic interview; n = 4) versus studies that used other assessment methods (self-administered rating scales or self-reported doctor diagnosed depression; n = 13). The other sensitivity analysis compared estimates for studies with “low”/”probably low” risk of bias in all RoB domains (n = 2) versus studies with at least one rating of “high”/“probably high” in any RoB domain (n = 15).
The two sensitivity analyses did not show a statistically significant effect. That is, estimates were not statistically significantly different for studies that assessed depression with the gold standard method (clinical diagnostic interview), compared with other methods (p = 0.56), nor for studies with only “low”/”probably low” risk of bias ratings compared to studies with one or more “high”/”probably high” risk of bias ratings (p = 0.52). The forest plots of the sensitivity analyses are presented in Appendix 9 in the Supplementary data.

4.6. Quality of evidence
outcomes of our interest; we therefore did not downgrade the quality of evidence for this consideration (+/ 0 levels). We had serious concerns for imprecision, because if the lower confidence limit for our best OR estimate (from the meta-analysis) represented the truth (0.86) there would have been an appreciable beneficial effect of exposure to long working hours. If the upper confidence limit represented the truth (OR 1.29), there would have been an appreciable harmful effect of exposure to long working hours. Consequently, we downgraded for imprecision by one level ( 1). We did not have any serious concerns for publication bias (+/ 0 levels; funnel plot not calculated because there were fewer than ten studies). There was no large effect estimate, no evidence for a dose–response and no evidence suggesting that residual confounding, bias or effect modification had led to an underestimation of the effect, and consequently we did not upgrade the body of evidence (+/ 0 levels). In conclusion, we started at “moderate” quality of evidence for observational studies and downgraded by a total of two levels ( 2) and did not upgrade (+/ 0) to arrive at a final rating of the quality of evidence as “low”; further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.

4.7. Comparison: Worked 49–54 h/week compared with worked 35–40 h/week
We now report assessments of the quality of evidence for the entire body of evidence on the outcome “Acquired depression” (depression incidence) for the three eligible comparisons included in this systematic review.

4.6.1. Comparison: Worked 41–48 h/week compared with worked 35–40 h/week
We had serious concerns regarding risk of bias in the body of evidence for this comparison. First, we were concerned about risk of selection bias due to incomplete outcome data (domain 6 in our risk of bias assessment), as the majority of studies assessed depression at baseline and then again some years later at follow-up, which means that these studies likely missed cases of depression with onset between baseline and follow-up that were in remission at the time of the follow-up assessment. Second, most studies did not assess whether study participants had ever experienced an episode of depression before assessment. For these studies, it is unclear whether incident depression during the study period was first time incidence of depression or recurrent incidence of depression. We are uncertain if the incomplete outcome data during follow-up or the failure to assess life-time depression before baseline have biased the estimate of the association between baseline working hours and risk of depression in the studies. But since we cannot rule out risk of bias with confidence, we had serious concerns for risk of bias and consequently downgraded the quality of evidence by one level ( 1).
We had no serious concerns for inconsistency, as the I2 of 40% indicated only moderate heterogeneity (+/ 0 levels). We did not have any serious concerns for indirectness because the body of evidence reasonably well matched the populations, exposures, comparators and outcomes of our interest, and we therefore did not downgrade the quality of evidence for this consideration (+/ 0 levels). We however had serious concerns for imprecision, because if the upper confidence limit for our best estimate (from the meta-analysis) represented the truth (OR 1.21), there would have been an appreciable harmful effect of exposure to long working hours, and we therefore downgraded by one level ( 1). We did not have serious concerns for publication bias (+/ 0 levels, funnel plot not calculated because there were fewer than ten studies). There was neither a large effect estimate, nor evidence for a dose–response, nor evidence suggesting that residual confounding, bias or effect modification had led to an underestimation of the effect, and consequently we did not upgrade the body of evidence (+/ 0 levels). In conclusion, we started at “moderate” quality of evidence for observational studies; downgraded by a total of two levels ( 2); did not upgrade.

4.7.1. Comparison: Worked ≥55 h/week compared with worked 35–40 h/week
As for the previous two comparisons (described above), we also had serious concerns regarding risk of bias in the body of evidence on the comparison of weekly working hours of ≥55 compared with 35–40 for incident depression, because of possible incomplete outcome reporting (domain 6 of the risk of bias assessment) and failure to measure episodes of depression prior to baseline. Consequently, we downgraded the quality of evidence by one level ( 1) for risk of bias.
We had no serious concerns for inconsistency, as the I2 of 46% indicated only moderate heterogeneity (+/ 0 levels). We did not have any serious concerns for indirectness, because the body of evidence reasonably well matched the populations, exposures, comparators and outcomes of our interest, and we therefore did not downgrade the quality of evidence.

We were not able to access data that could offer evidence for a discussion of other compelling attributes in assessing the strength of evidence. Additional assessment of strength of evidence based on the Bradford Hill considerations is presented in Appendix 9 in the Supplementary data (though note that this is already covered via our approach to evaluating the quality of evidence as described above).

4.8.5. Rating by outcome and comparison
Based on the considerations presented above, we judged the existing bodies of evidence as:

- “Inadequate evidence of harmfulness” for the exposure categories 41–48, 49–54 and ≥ 55h/week for “Has depression” (depression prevalence); the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects of the exposure.
- “Inadequate evidence of harmfulness” for the exposure categories 41–48, 49–54 and ≥55 h/week for “Acquired depression” (depression incidence).
- “Inadequate evidence of harmfulness” for the exposure categories 41–48, 49–54 and ≥55 h/week for the outcome “Died from depression” (depression mortality).

5. Discussion

5.1. Summary of evidence
As shown in the table of summary of findings (Table 8), our systematic review found no eligible study on the outcomes of depression prevalence and depression mortality, resulting in ratings of “low quality of evidence” and “inadequate evidence of harmfulness” for all three exposure categories for these outcomes. Our systematic review found 22 eligible studies for depression incidence, of which 17 studies were included in one or more meta-analyses. We found low quality of evidence and inadequate evidence of harmfulness for the effect of working 41–48, 49–54 and ≥ 55 h/weeks on the outcome of depression incidence, when compared with working 35–40 h/week.

5.2. Comparison to previous systematic review evidence
To our knowledge, three systematic reviews have in recent years examined the association between exposure to long working hours and risk of depression. The Theorell et al. systematic review included six cohort studies and did not conduct a meta-analysis, and the authors concluded that the evidence for any increase of depression from exposure to long working hours was “limited” for women and “very limited” for men. The Watanabe et al. systematic review included seven cohort studies and reported a modestly elevated pooled RR that included unity (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.75) for the association between working ≥50 h/week and depression based on a sensitivity analyses of four cohort studies. The Virtanen et al. systematic review and meta-analysis included 28 studies (ten published and 18 unpublished ones) and reported a RR of 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.25) for the outcome “depressive symptoms” (combining clinical depression, depressive symptoms and psychological distress) and a RR of 1.09 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.26) for the outcome “depression” (combining clinical depression and depressive symptoms but excluding psychological distress). Our systematic review and meta-analysis covered the three outcomes “Has depression”, “Acquired depression” and “Died from depression”, identifying 22 studies for the outcome “Acquired depression”, while identifying no studies for the outcomes “Has depression” and “Died from depression”. Our review included three comparisons (41–48 vs 35–40 h/week, 49–54 vs 35–40 h/week and ≥55 h/week, compared with 35–40 h/week), and it found that the body of evidence for all three outcomes and all three comparisons was inadequate to assess harmfulness. Compared to the previous systematic reviews, our systematic review and meta-analysis had some added value. First, we published a protocol detailing all methods of the systematic review and meta-analysis before commencing literature search. Second, by searching seven academic databases and two grey literature databases, our search was more comprehensive than the searches in the previous reviews. Third, we searched the literature up to July 2018 with a supplementary top-up search of Medline shortly before finalizing the article (November 2019) resulting in the most up-to-date review. We considered all studies included in the previous reviews and identified two additional studies not included in the previous reviews. Fourth, we were able to re-analyse six studies, allowing us to harmonize exposure data and statistical modelling. Fifth, we applied state-of-the-art methods for assessing quality of evidence and strengths of evidence, using both GRADE and Navigation Guide methodology.

5.3. Limitations and strengths of this review

5.3.1. Limitations
Our systematic review has several limitations. First, we may have missed eligible studies, for example due to them being published in languages other than English. However, as we searched seven academic and two grey literature databases using a comprehensive search strategy, conducted an extensive hand search and consulted additional experts who also did not identify any additional eligible studies, we believe it is unlikely that we missed any important study.
Second, we did not receive a substantial amount of the missing data we requested for the studies included in this systematic review. We requested missing data from principal study authors at least three times, but the principal study authors generally did not share these requested missing data with us or only shared selected data. As a result, subgroup analyses by sex, age group and SES could only be conducted for a limited number of studies.
Third, all identified eligible studies were observational studies and therefore vulnerable to bias due to unmeasured confounding. Experimental studies, quasi-experimental studies or natural experiments could have provided stronger evidence, but we did not find any of these study types that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We found one remarkable uncontrolled before-and-after study with first-year medical residents in Japan that measured depressive symptoms and clinical depression before and after entering residency. Entering residency led to exposure to very long working hours, with 45% of residents reporting working ≥ 80 h/week. The study showed a marked increase of depressive symptoms in the study participants after 3 months in residency, particularly amongst residents working 80–99 h/week and ≥100 h/week, suggesting that very long working hours, exceeding the predefined working hours categories in our review, might substantially increase risk of depression. However, as the study was conducted without a control group, it did not fulfil our predefined eligibility criteria, and we had to exclude it from our systematic review.
Fourth, the validity of exposure assessment was somehow restricted, not only due to concerns of self-reported exposure measurements, but also since exposure to long working hours was assessed at baseline only. This has likely resulted in exposure misclassification, as average hours worked per week may change over time. Further, the lack of repeated measures of exposure made it impossible to analyse the potential effect of changes in exposure.
Fifth, we provided subgroup analyses stratified by WHO region, but national health, labour and other social policies, as well as welfare state regimes, may vary considerably within these regions. It is conceivable that these variations modify association between working conditions, including exposure to long working hours, and risk of depression. | Outcomes                                          | Exposure             | Illustrative comparative risks (95% CI)                        | Relative             | No. of                    | Navigation Guide (               | Navigation Guide                | Comments                                   |

Navigation Guide quality of evidence ratings:
- High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
- Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
- Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.

Navigation Guide strength of evidence ratings:
- Sufficient evidence of harmfulness: The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies, and the conclusion is unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies. For human evidence a positive relationship is observed between exposure and outcome where chance, bias, and confounding, can be ruled out with reasonable confidence.
- Limited evidence of harmfulness: The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the exposure, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as: the number, size, or quality of individual studies, the confidence in the effect, or inconsistency of findings across individual studies. As more information becomes available, the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion. For human evidence a positive relationship is observed between exposure and outcome where chance, bias, and confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence.
- Inadequate evidence of harmfulness: Studies permit no conclusion about a toxic effect. The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects of the exposure. Evidence is insufficient because of: the limited number or size of studies, low quality of individual studies, or inconsistency of findings across individual studies. More information may allow an estimation of effects.
- Evidence of lack of harmfulness: The available evidence includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies, and the conclusion is unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies. For human evidence more than one study showed no effect on the outcome of interest at the full range of exposure levels that humans are known to encounter, where bias and confounding can be ruled out with reasonable confidence. The conclusion is limited to the age at exposure and/or other conditions and levels of exposure studied. 5.3.2. Strengths
Our systematic review and meta-analysis have several strengths, including:

- Strictly speaking, previous systematic reviews have not undergone all steps of a systematic review, but our systematic review and meta-analysis have done so, including having pre-published a protocol and having assessed the strength of evidence; this presents a substantial improvement in systematic review methods on the topic.
- Previous systematic reviews have not commonly and not comprehensively provided detailed analyses across all analytic steps of the systematic review and meta-analysis for comparisons of standard categories of exposure to long working hours compared with standard working hours, but we have provided such analyses for three such comparisons commonly used in the epidemiological literature across all steps of the systematic review, and again this provides an improvement in accuracy of systematic review evidence on this topic.
- Whereas previous systematic review evidence has not commonly and comprehensively assessed risk of bias and quality of evidence using established systematic review frameworks with dedicated tools and approaches, we have applied the Navigation Guide framework in this systematic review, which should have ensured rigor and transparency in this systematic review.
- In previous systematic reviews, strength of the evidence was not commonly assessed, but in our systematic review we have applied pre-specified criteria to rate the strength of evidence for each included comparison for each included outcome; again, this is a novel contribution to the systematic review and meta-analytic body of evidence on the topic.
- Finally, to our knowledge, this is amongst the first systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted specifically for a global occupational burden of disease study, and as such it provides a model for future systematic reviews that will help ensure that these global health estimates adhere fully with the GATHER Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting.

6. Use of evidence for burden of disease estimation
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by WHO and ILO, supported by a large number of individual experts, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. More specifically, it provides the evidence base for the organizations to consider producing estimates of the burden of deaths and DALYs from depression attributable to exposure to long working hours. The systematic review found a considerable number of studies, but the body of evidence was rated as “inadequate evidence of harmfulness” of exposure to long working hours for having, acquiring and dying from depression; the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects of the exposure. Producing estimates of the burden of depression attributable to exposure to long working hours appears therefore not evidence-based at this point. To improve the evidence base for WHO and ILO’s future considerations of producing WHO/ILO Joint Estimates of the depression burden from exposure to long working hours, better studies are needed that examine whether and to what extent working long hours increases risk of depression. Such studies should address the limitations in the literature identified in this systematic review, including:

- Assessing depression not only at baseline and follow-up, but also continuously monitoring the onset of depression between baseline and follow-up, which would allow to conduct time-to-event analyses. This can be done for example by using register data for hospital-treated depression, as has been shown in research on the association between job strain and clinical depression.
- Assessing lifetime prevalence of depression prior to baseline, to distinguish between first-time onset of depression and onset of recurrent depression during follow-up. This can be done either by diagnostic interviews or by use of health register data.
- Measuring exposure to long working hours not only once but repeatedly, taking changes in exposure into consideration. This would not only give more precise exposure data but also allow analysing observational data as a non-randomized pseudo trial; this has been done for example in research on onset of impaired sleep and change in health-related behaviours.
- Conducting experiments (if found to be ethical and feasible) and quasi-experimental studies, including natural experiment studies, on the effect of exposure to long working hours on the risk of depression.

7. Conclusions
We did not identify studies providing evidence on the association between long working hours and depression prevalence and depression mortality. Regarding depression incidence, we identified 22 studies. From these bodies of evidence, we are very uncertain regarding the effect of exposure to long working hours on having, acquiring and dying from depression and judged the existing bodies of evidence from human data as “inadequate evidence for harmfulness” for the exposure categories 41–48, 48–54 and ≥55 h/week, compared with 35–40 h/week.

8. Differences between protocol and systematic review
- In the protocol, we planned to convert ORs into RRs, if possible. For such conversions, information on the “prevalence of outcome in reference group or baseline risk” is required. However, such information was not available from the included studies. As all included studies reported ORs, we meta-analysed these ORs.
- There were no deviations from the Medline search strategy that was published in the protocol other than corrections of typing errors.
