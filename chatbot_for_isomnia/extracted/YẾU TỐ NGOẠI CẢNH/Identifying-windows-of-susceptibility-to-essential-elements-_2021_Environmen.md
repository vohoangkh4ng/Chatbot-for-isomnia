### Background
Essential elements such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), rubidium (Rb), strontium (Sr), and molybdenum (Mo) are necessary for reproductive health. However, their associations with human semen quality remain inconclusive.

### Objectives
To investigate the associations of urinary Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo concentrations with semen quality in healthy men screened as potential sperm donors and identify critical windows of susceptibility.

### Methods
1428 healthy men provided 3766 urine and 6527 semen samples, which were measured for urinary essential element concentrations and sperm quality parameters, respectively. Linear mixed models and cubic spline curves were used to evaluate associations between urinary essential elements and semen quality. Multiple informant models were used to identify potential critical windows of susceptibility.

### Results
Linear mixed models and cubic spline curves showed positive dose–response relationships between urinary Zn and sperm concentration and total count and between urinary Mo and total sperm count [all False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted p-value for trend < 0.05]. In the multiple-element linear mixed models, the men in the highest versus lowest quartiles of urinary Zn and Mo had a higher sperm concentration of 17.5% (95% CI: 2.8%, 34.2%; p-value for trend = 0.006) and total sperm count of 18.3% (95% CI: 1.4%, 38.0%; p-value for trend = 0.027), respectively. Urinary Zn was also positively associated with total sperm count in a dose-dependent manner (p-value for trend = 0.036), though the percentile difference in total sperm count between men in the highest and lowest quartile was not statistically significant (16.4%, 95% CI: 1.7%, 37.9%). These associations appeared to be stronger when urinary Zn and Mo were measured at 0–9 days before the date of semen examination (i.e., corresponding to epididymal storage).

### Conclusions
Higher urinary Zn and Mo, particularly during the period of epididymal storage, were associated with greater sperm production.

### 1. Introduction
Iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), rubidium (Rb), strontium (Sr), and molybdenum (Mo) are well-known essential elements that act as a pivotal role for the growth and development of all organs. Lower levels of these elements in the body have been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, lung cancer, and chronic liver disease. However, it remains unclear whether insufficient intake of Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo impairs male fertility. A worldwide decline in semen quality is the leading cause of the decreasing trend of male fertility over the past several decades. Several epidemiologic studies have yielded inconsistent associations between Cu, Zn, Se, and Mo and semen quality. For instance, Zeng et al. revealed an inverse association between urinary Se and risk of below-reference total sperm count among 394 Chinese men from an infertility clinic. In a similar study population with a larger sample size, Wang et al. reported a positive association between urinary Zn and total sperm count, and between seminal plasma Zn and Se and sperm concentration. However, several studies also reported negative or null associations between Cu, Zn, Se, and Mo and semen quality. Population evidence associating Fe, Co, Rb, and Sr with semen quality is lacking.

One key methodological issue of these previous studies is that they mostly relied on measurements of essential elements and sperm quality parameters at a single time point and ignored their considerable high within-individual variability, which is prone to result in measurement error. Besides, most previous studies were conducted among occupationally exposed men or subfertile men from infertility clinics, which is not generalizable to the general population. More importantly, while it is well-known that the entire period of spermatogenesis includes 4 key periods (i.e., epididymal storage, sperm motility development, meiosis, and spermatogenesis), the critical windows of susceptibility, which can be used to improve mechanistic insights and optimize clinical intervention among subfertile men, remains unclear.

Therefore, we conducted this study with repeated collections of biospecimens among healthy men screening as potential sperm donors with intentions to:
a) assess the variability of serial measurements of urinary Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo;
b) explore the associations between the within-subject average urinary concentrations of Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo and sperm quality parameters; and
c) identify critical windows of susceptibility to essential elements measured at 0–9, 10–14, 15–69, and 70–90 days before the date of semen examination (i.e., corresponding to epididymal storage, the development of sperm motility, meiosis, and spermatogenesis, respectively).

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Study population

The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Reproductive Medicine Center of Tongji Medical College. The study design has been published elsewhere. Briefly, eligible participants were healthy men aged 22–45 years without any genetic or sexually transmitted diseases who intended to donate semen at the Hubei Province Human Sperm Bank. All potential sperm donors underwent an initial measurement of semen quality, fulfilled a self-reported questionnaire (e.g., demographic characteristics, reproductive history, and lifestyle habits), and completed a physical examination (e.g., weight and height) at recruitment. For participants who had eligible fresh (i.e., progressive motility ≥ 60%, sperm concentration ≥ 60 million/mL, and percentage of normal morphology > 30%) and post-thaw semen samples (i.e., number of motile sperm per vial ≥ 12 × 10^6, progressive motility ≥ 40%, and frozen-thaw survival rate ≥ 60%), additional eligible semen samples for impregnating up to five women were collected at different time points during the following 6 months. For participants who did not meet the donation criteria, they were required to provide 1–4 additional semen specimens for further screening. Urine samples were also collected on the same day (in most cases within 1 h) when participants underwent a semen examination at pre-specified study intervals [i.e., days 0 (baseline), 1–15, 16–31, 32–63, and ≥ 64 from initial recruitment]. Only one urine sample was required for each specified study interval, but participants could donate more than one semen sample within each study interval. Some participants might miss the urine sample collection for a specified study interval. Between April 19, 2017 and July 15, 2018, a total of 1487 men were enrolled and followed until the end of donation, withdrawal from the study, or study closure, whichever came first. Of whom, 59 men were excluded from the current analysis due to insufficient urinary volume for the determination of essential elements, leaving 1428 men with 3766 urine samples and 6527 semen examinations in our subsequent analyses.

### 2.2. Urine collection and determination

Urine samples were collected in trace-element-free polyethylene containers. After collection, urine specimens were immediately frozen at -40 °C until laboratory determination. Urinary concentrations of Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo were determined using our previously established method. Concisely, 3.0 mL urine samples were acidified with 67% HNO3 (v/v) at least 24 h. Then, 1.0 mL of each acidified urine.

From April 19, 2017 to July 15, 2018
1487 participants with 6608 visits were included

59 participants were excluded due to insufficient urinary volume for analysis at any visit

1428 participants with 3766 urine samples and 6527 semen samples were included for subsequent analyses

Identifying critical exposure windows across different stages of spermatogenesis:

0-9 days before the date of semen examination (epididymal storage): N = 1428
10-14 days before the date of semen examination (sperm motility development): N = 587
15-69 days before the date of semen examination (meiosis): N = 868
70-90 days before the date of semen examination (spermatogenesis): N = 439

Fig. 1. Study flow. Abbreviations: N, analytic sample size. During the entire study period, a total of 3766 urine and 6527 semen samples were provided by the 1428 men. The 3766 urine samples were collected on the same day when participants underwent a semen examination (n = 3766), and 2761 semen examinations were conducted without a simultaneous collection of a urine sample. For each urine sample, it was separately paired with all the semen samples provided by the same man, and the time interval of each urine-semen pair (i.e., date of semen examination – date of urine collection) was also calculated. After excluding 564 semen examinations without urine sample collected within 0–90 days before the date of semen determination, the time intervals were categorized into 4 critical windows of susceptibility to urinary essential elements measured at 0–9, 10–14, 15–69, and 70–90 days before the date of semen examination (i.e., corresponding to epididymal storage, the development of sperm motility, meiosis, and spermatogenesis, respectively). For participants who had repeated measurements of urinary essential elements or sperm quality parameters within a specific window, we averaged the measurements of urinary essential elements or sperm quality parameters before the analyses of window-specific associations, leaving 1428 participants with 3322 unique urine-semen pairs included in the analyses of window-specific associations. sample was directly diluted to 5.0 mL with 1.2% HNO3 (v/v), which was finally injected into inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7700, Agilent Technologies, USA). Standard reference materials (SRMs) 1640a and SRMs 2670a were used as quality controls to ascertain the accuracy of the determination. Spiked pooled urine samples of 100 randomly selected samples showed precise recoveries (80–120%) and low coefficients of variance (<10.0%). The limits of quantification (LOQ) for urinary Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo ranged from 0.0054 to 1.96 μg/L. The measured concentrations below the LOQ were replaced with LOQ/√2, and those “above the mean concentration + 3SD” were replaced with “mean concentration + 3SD”. Urinary essential element concentrations collected from the same subject were log-transformed to normalize the skewed distributions and then averaged to reflect within-subject average exposure levels during the study period. Urinary creatinine concentrations were also detected to standardize urinary dilution using an automated clinical chemistry analyzer.

## 2.3. Semen collection and determination

Semen specimens were collected at recruitment and each follow-up visit by masturbation into a trace-element-free polypropylene container. Semen quality was evaluated by qualified laboratory technicians following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). In brief, after liquefication in a heating chamber at 37 ◦C for approximately 30 min, semen volume (mL) was assessed by a weighing method, assuming 1 g = 1 mL. Total and progressive sperm motility (%) and sperm concentration (million/mL) were evaluated by a clean Makler chamber utilizing an optical microscope. Total sperm count (million per ejaculation) was calculated by multiplying sperm concentration by semen volume. Internal quality control was routinely performed by professional technicians to ascertain that the intraday and interday variations were < 10%.

## 2.4. Statistical analyses

Data were analyzed using R version 3.6.1, SAS version 9.4, and Stata version 15.0. Descriptive statistics were used to describe participants’ demographic characteristics and the distribution of urinary essential element concentrations and sperm quality parameters. Sperm quality parameters were log-transformed in all subsequent analyses to reach normality distribution. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was conducted to characterize the correlations between urinary essential element concentrations. The reproducibility of urinary essential element concentrations was evaluated by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), which was the ratio of between-subject variance and the total variance.

Based on the distribution of the whole study population (n = 1428), the within-subject average concentrations of urinary essential elements were categorized into quartiles. We explored the associations between categorized urinary essential elements and repeated sperm quality parameters (n = 6527) using linear mixed models with a subject-specific random intercept. Tests for trend were evaluated by entering the quartiles of exposures as continuous variables using integer values (i.e., 1–4). False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustment was applied to account for multiple comparisons. To detect the simultaneous effects of multiple elements on sperm quality parameters, we applied multiple-element models that simultaneously included the same covariates and other elements with significant effect estimates (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05) in single-element models. For elements with significant effect estimates both in the single- and multiple-element models, we further used restricted cubic splines to examine potential non-linear associations between continuous exposures and sperm quality parameters.

We further constructed multiple informant models to identify the critical windows of susceptibility to essential elements measured at 0–9, 10–14, 15–69, and 70–90 days before the date of semen examination (i.e., corresponding to epididymal storage, the development of sperm motility, meiosis, and spermatogenesis, respectively). This multiple informant model treated urinary essential elements at 4 windows as informants and used unified generalized estimating equations embedding with linear regression models to estimate the separate associations in the same statistical model. This method also provided a way to test the difference in the estimations for associations of urinary essential elements with semen quality across the tested critical windows.

Potential confounders were selected a priori based on the previous literature and were included in the multivariable models if their inclusion caused >10% changes in the estimation for any association between urinary essential elements and sperm quality parameters. For consistency, a similar set of covariates was used in all multivariable models: age, BMI, waist-hip ratio, abstinence time, the history of having ever fathered a pregnancy, education level, occupation, smoking status, alcohol consumption, tea consumption, income, sampling season, and liquefaction time. Urinary creatinine was also included in all multivariable models to correct for urine dilution.

To evaluate the robustness of our results, we conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we re-analyzed the single- and multiple-element linear regression models using within-subject average measurements of semen quality. Second, we re-analyzed the multiple-element linear mixed models, in which urinary essential element concentrations were averaged before log-transformation. Third, we re-analyzed the multiple-element linear mixed models by adding the time of sampling (sampling frequency) and the average intervals between urine collections as covariates. A p-value < 0.05 was defined as statistical significance.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Characteristics of participants

Of the 1428 men recruited in our current analyses, the mean (SD) age, BMI, waist-hip ratio, abstinence time, and liquefaction time were 28.0 (5.3) years, 22.9 (3.2) kg/m2, 0.8 (0.1), 6.2 (3.4) days, and 24.7 (10.6) min, respectively. The majority of the participants had less than a bachelor degree (64.5%), had a self-reported income of > 4000 Yuan/month (71.1%), never fathered a pregnancy (72.8%), never smoked (53.4%), and occasionally drank alcohol (61.3%). Only a small proportion of the semen samples were collected in the winter due to the Chinese Spring Holiday (14.0%).

### 3.2. Distribution of urinary essential elements and sperm quality parameters

A total of 3766 urine samples were collected from 1428 men during the study period. The detection rates of Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo in urine were 99.9%, 99.0%, 98.3%, 100%, 97.8%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that all of the tested elements were significantly correlated with each other (all p-value < 0.05). The highest median concentration was observed for Rb (1492.09 μg/L), followed by Zn (457.27 μg/L), Sr (117.27 μg/L), Mo (54.15 μg/L), Fe (17.81 μg/L), Se (14.21 μg/L), Cu (9.97 μg/L), and Co (0.21 μg/L). The ICCs for repeated measurements of urinary Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo ranged from 0.04 to 0.41.

a Percentile difference [%Δ (95% CI)] was obtained from the following formula: [10(beta) - 1] × 100. Within-subject average urinary essential element concentrations were calculated from 3766 urine samples. Models were adjusted for within-subject average urinary creatinine (continuous), age (continuous), BMI (continuous), waist-hip ratio (continuous), abstinence time (continuous), history of having ever fathered a child (yes or no), education level (less than undergraduate or undergraduate or above), occupation (employed, unemployed, or student), smoking status (never, former, or current), alcohol consumption (never, former, occasional, or current), tea consumption (yes or no), household income (≤4000, 4001–8000, or > 8000 RMB Yuan/month), sampling season (spring, summer, fall, or winter), and liquefaction time (continuous).

within-subject average parameters of semen quality both in single- and multiple-element linear regression models (Fig. S2 and Table S3), and when we averaged urinary essential elements before log-transformation or additionally included the time of sampling (sampling frequency) and the average intervals between urine collections in the multiple-element linear mixed models (Tables S4 and S5). The restricted cubic spline curves further demonstrated the monotonically rising nature of these dose–response relationships, though we observed a decreasing sperm concentration and total count among the men who had extremely high urinary Zn and Mo concentrations (> 90th) (Fig. 3).

3.4. Windows-specific associations between urinary essential elements and semen quality

We further separately assessed the associations between urinary Zn and Mo measured at 0–9, 10–14, 15–69, and 70–90 days before the date of semen examination and semen quality (Fig. 1). The positive associations between urinary Zn and sperm concentration and total count were stronger when urinary Zn was measured at 0–9 days before the date of semen examination (i.e., corresponding to epididymal storage) (All Pint = 0.011) (Table 3). Similarly, the association between urinary Mo and total sperm count was also stronger when urinary Mo was measured at 0–9 days before the date of semen examination (Table 3), although the difference in the estimations across the stages of spermatogenesis was not significant (Pint = 0.179).

4. Discussion

Among 1428 non-occupationally exposed healthy young men screened as potential sperm donors, we found poor reproducibility in the serial measurements of urinary Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo (creatinine-adjusted ICCs = 0.04–0.41). Based on single- and multiple-element adjusted models, we found positive dose–response relationships between urinary Zn and sperm concentration and total count, and between urinary Mo and total sperm count, which were further demonstrated by restricted cubic spline curves. These associations appeared to be stronger when urinary Zn and Mo were measured at 0–9 days before the date of semen examination.
The routes of Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo exposure are mainly through dietary intake and inhalation. In the current study, we found considerable within-individual variabilities in urinary Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo (creatinine-adjusted ICCs = 0.04–0.41), which are inevitable given the changing exposure status due to the variation in the daily dietary consumption, physiological status, and urinary flow rate. Our findings are consistent with many previous studies showing high within-individual variabilities in serial measurements of Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Sr, and Mo in spot urine samples, though the reported ICCs vary slightly due to the differences in the study population, sample sizes, sampling types, and duration of the sampling interval.
The geometric mean concentrations of urinary Zn (439.7 μg/L) and Mo (50.6 μg/L) in our present study were comparable to those reported among males from the Health Measures Survey in Canada (400.0 μg/L and 50.0 μg/L for urinary Zn and Mo, respectively), men from a reproductive clinic in China (408.5 μg/L for urinary Zn), and males from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA (46.2 μg/L for urinary Mo), but were slightly higher than those reported among non-occupationally exposed adults in the UK (median: 29.1 μg/L for urinary Mo). The comparisons suggest a regional variability in exposure levels of essential elements, highlighting the importance of assessing the reproductive effect of Zn and Mo among different populations.
Our results suggest that Zn and Mo are essential for spermatogenesis. In support of our findings, Telisman et al. revealed a significant positive association of serum Zn with sperm concentration and total count. Colagar et al. found significantly lower seminal plasma Zn concentrations among infertile individuals compared to fertile subjects. Chyra-Jach et al. observed lower seminal plasma Zn concentrations among men with asthenospermia when compared with fertile men. Recently, a systematic review concluded that Zn is necessary for normal spermatogenesis and sperm normal function. However, several previous studies also reported negative or null associations between Zn and Mo and semen quality. The discrepancies across studies were not unexpected given the relatively high within-individual variabilities in urinary essential element concentrations and sperm quality parameters, which may have resulted in biased risk estimations. The differences in exposure biomarkers, exposure levels, sample size, and study population may also explain the discrepancy. In our present study, we observed decreasing trends of sperm concentration and total count among the men who had extremely high urinary Zn and Mo concentrations, suggesting a potential inverse U-shaped association. Further investigations with a larger sample size are needed to verify our novel findings.
The biological mechanisms underlying the positive dose–response relationships between urinary Zn and Mo and semen quality remain unclear. Previous studies have proposed that Zn deficiency is associated with decreased production of sex hormones, interrupted function of metalloenzymes, destabilized stability of sperm chromatin, delayed testicular development, and particularly increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Because of its antioxidant properties, Zn plays an important role in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may decrease the oxidative damage induced by ROS. Moreover, the antioxidant property of Zn was also found to maintain sperm viability by Fig. 3.

Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index. The blue solid lines represent the effect estimates, and the shadowed parts are 95% confidence intervals. The reference values were set at the 25th percentile (i.e., 2.45 μg/L for Zn and 1.57 μg/L for Mo, respectively). Within-subject average urinary essential element concentrations were calculated from 3766 urine samples. Models were adjusted for within-subject average urinary (continuous), creatinine (continuous), BMI (continuous), waist-hip ratio (continuous), abstinence time (continuous), history of having ever fathered a child (yes or no), education level (less than undergraduate or undergraduate or above), occupation (employed, unemployed, or student), smoking status (never, former, or current), alcohol consumption (yes or no), household income (≤4000, 4001–8000, or > 8000 RMB Yuan/month), sampling season (spring, summer, fall, or winter), and liquefaction time (continuous).

Inhibiting DNase activity. Optimal Mo concentrations can significantly improve semen quality because of improved testicular function, probably by reducing levels of oxidative stress and activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, while increasing malondialdehyde levels in testes. Higher Zn may maintain a rich antioxidant environment in the microenvironment composed of blood-epididymal barrier. Besides, Zn was also reported to play an important role in keeping the integrity of tight junction proteins and allowing the epididymis to modify and regulate the luminal fluid contents, eventually promoting spermatogenesis. An early animal study revealed that an appreciable quantity of Mo accumulated in the epididymis after oral administration, indicating that Mo may be important to the epididymis. Table 3 A major strength of our study was that we repeatedly measured urinary essential element concentrations and sperm quality parameters at different time points, which reduces measurement error. Additionally, we explored the window-specific associations between urinary essential elements and semen quality, which can be used to improve mechanistic insights and optimize clinical intervention among subfertile men. Finally, our study participants were healthy adults screened as potential sperm donors, which is more generalizable than recruited participants from infertility clinics. Nevertheless, the study has several limitations. First, this is an observational study and, thus, cannot establish causal associations. Second, spot void rather than 24-h urine sample was used to evaluate the exposure levels of essential elements, which may lead to exposure misclassification because of the considerable high within-day variation. Third, though we have accounted for several potential confounders such as abstinence period and sampling season, unmeasured or residual confounders (e.g., diet and other environmental pollutants) cannot be fully excluded. Finally, we could not establish the biological mechanisms underlying the protective effects of Zn and Mo on semen quality.

5. Conclusions Among 1428 healthy men, we observed high within-individual variability in urinary concentrations of Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, and Mo, emphasizing the importance of repeated measurements to reduce exposure misclassification among healthy males. Based on a repeated-measures study design, we found positive dose–response relationships between urinary Zn and sperm concentration and total count, and between urinary Mo and total sperm count, which appeared to be stronger when exposures were measured at 0–9 days before the date of semen examination (i.e., corresponding to epididymal storage). These findings highlight the potential importance of Zn and Mo in improving human semen quality.

a Days 0–9, 10–14, 15–69, and 70–90 before the date of semen examination correspond to the 4 periods of spermatogenesis (i.e., corresponding to epididymal storage, sperm motility development, meiosis, and spermatogenesis); for participants who had repeated measurements of urinary essential elements or semen quality within a specific window of susceptibility (0–9, 10–14, 15–69, and 70–90 days before the date of semen examination), we averaged the measurements of urinary essential elements and sperm quality parameters before data analysis.

b Percentile difference [%Δ (95% CI)] was obtained from the following formula: [10(beta) 1] × 100. Models were adjusted for average urinary creatinine (continuous; averaged values were used if repeated measurements were conducted within a specific window), age (continuous), BMI (continuous), waist-hip ratio (continuous), average abstinence time (continuous; averaged values were used if repeated measurements were conducted within a specific window), history of having ever fathered a child (yes or no), education level (less than undergraduate or undergraduate or above), occupation (employed, unemployed, or student), smoking status (never, former, or current), alcohol consumption (never, former, occasional, or current), tea consumption (yes or no), household income (≤4000, 4001–8000, or > 8000 RMB Yuan/month), and average liquefaction time (continuous; averaged values were used if repeated measurements were conducted within a specific window).

c Test was conducted based on multiple informant models that treated urinary essential elements at 4 windows as informants and used unified generalized estimating equations embedding with linear regression models to estimate the separate associations in the same statistical model.
