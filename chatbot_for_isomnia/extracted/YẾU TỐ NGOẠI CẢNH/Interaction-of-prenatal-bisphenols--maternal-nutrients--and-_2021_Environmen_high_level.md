# Title: Interaction of prenatal bisphenols, maternal nutrients, and toxic metal exposures on neurodevelopment of 2-year-olds in the APrON cohort

## Summary: This article investigates the effects of prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) on the neurodevelopment of children at two years of age, considering the modifying roles of maternal nutrient status and co-exposure to toxic metals. The study analyzes maternal urine for bisphenol concentrations and blood for metals and nutrients, assessing child development using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III. Results indicate that higher maternal cadmium (Cd) is linked to poorer motor performance, while selenium (Se) levels are associated with lower scores across various developmental scales. The findings suggest that maternal Se may mitigate the adverse effects of bisphenols, highlighting the need for further research on nutrient-bisphenol interactions and their sex-specific impacts on child development.
