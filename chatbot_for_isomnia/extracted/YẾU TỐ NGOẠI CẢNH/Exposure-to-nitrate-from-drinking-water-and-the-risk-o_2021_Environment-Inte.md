**Keywords:**
Nitrate
Drinking water
Childhood leukemia
Lymphoma and central nervous system cancer

**Background:** There is limited evidence that nitrate, a common contaminant in drinking water, increases the risk of childhood cancers. Our objective was to examine this association in Denmark.
**Methods:** We conducted a nationwide case-control study based on all singletons liveborn to Danish-born parents from 1991 to 2015 (N = 1,219,140) that included 596 leukemias, 180 lymphomas, and 310 central nervous system cancers (CNC) who were ≤15 years of age at diagnosis and were identified from the Danish Cancer Registry. Approximately 100 controls were randomly selected and matched to each case on date of birth and sex. Nitrate measurements in public water systems were linked with an address registry to estimate individual average nitrate concentrations during preconception, prenatal, and postnatal periods. Odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression controlling for the matching variables, and birth order, birthweight, urbanicity, maternal education, employment, income and smoking, and parental age.
**Results:** There was no evidence of an association of nitrate with leukemia or lymphoma. An association between CNC and the highest category of nitrate exposure (>25 mg/L nitrate) was observed for preconception (OR 1.82, 95%CI:1.09 to 3.04), prenatal (OR = 1.65, 95%CI:0.97 to 2.81), and postnatal exposure (OR = 1.48, 95% CI:0.82 to 2.68) in fully adjusted models. There was also some evidence of an exposure–response in models of continuous nitrate exposure and CNC.
**Conclusions:** Our findings provide some evidence that exposure to nitrate from drinking water may increase the risk of childhood CNC cancer, but not leukemia or lymphoma.

## 1. Introduction

Nitrate (NO3–) is a common contaminant in drinking water worldwide. Nitrate contamination results primarily from the use of nitrogen fertilizers and manure from large-scale animal operations. In 2012, approximately 2.5% of the Danish population that received drinking water from public supplies and 37% of the population that received water from private wells had elevated concentrations of nitrate (>25 mg/L).

Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, and brain cancers are the leading cause of childhood cancer mortality. Aside from radiation and perhaps pesticides and ambient air pollution, there are no well recognized environmental risk factors for childhood cancer. genetic factors are believed to only account for a small proportion

Three previous studies of childhood brain cancer and two studies of leukemia have examined the risk associated with nitrate in drinking water with mixed results. A common limitation of prior studies was their uncertain assessments of nitrate in drinking water. Our objective was to fill this data gap by conducting a study based on over 1.2 million singleton births, utilizing individual level estimates of nitrate in drinking water and childhood cancer in Denmark.

## Methods

We performed a nationwide nested case-control study based on the population delineated using the Danish Civil Registration System linked on an individual level with the Danish Medical Birth Registry of all live born singletons born in Denmark from 1991 to 2015 by Danish born parents (N = 1,219,140 children). The parental place of birth was obtained from the Danish Civil Registration System.

The children were linked with the Danish National Cancer Registry using the unique identification number assigned to every Danish resident. We identified all incident cases of childhood cancer from birth through 15 years of age. A total of 682 leukemia, 211 lymphoma, and 358 central nervous system cancer (CNC) cases were identified. One hundred controls per case were randomly selected, without replacement, from all births using incidence density sampling. Controls were matched to cases on sex and date of birth (±5 days). The main analyses were further restricted to individuals receiving water solely from public water systems and who did not have missing nitrate exposure estimates. This resulted in a final study size of 596 cases and 52,308 controls for leukemia, 180 cases and 15,329 controls for lymphoma, and 310 cases and 26,897 controls for CNC.

Analyses were conducted for the major categories of leukemia, lymphoma, and CNC as defined by the International Classification of Childhood Cancer. We also performed an analysis of common subtypes of leukemia and CNC.

### Exposure assessment

information (19% of all water supply area/year dyads) using linear interpolation between two sampled years or the closest observation for the tails. We only imputed data when a sample was taken within three years, otherwise no information was assigned to the water supply area/year.

Longitudinal residential address histories for each mother and child pair were obtained from the Danish Civil Registration System. Addresses were linked to the calendar-year specific average exposure estimates for their water system. We computed time-weighted average exposure for each child during pregnancy, for pregnancy trimesters, and for 90 days prior to conception. Time weighted average postnatal exposures were estimated at the age of diagnosis for the case and at the same age for their matched controls during childhood (age 0 to 15), age 0 to <5, age 5 to <10, and age 10 to 15.

We excluded users of private wells at any time in the main analysis of this study because drinking water quality monitoring of private wells is much less complete (about 50% of wells) and private wells have generally poorer water quality than public supplies. We also examined whether well use at any time was associated with childhood cancer.

### Covariates

Information on birthweight (continuous), birth order (1st, 2nd, ≥3rd), maternal and paternal age (years), maternal smoking during pregnancy (yes/no), and pre-pregnancy maternal weight (kilograms) and height (meters) were obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Registry and used to calculate the body mass index (BMI). Information on parental employment (employed, unemployed, not in the workforce), parental education (primary, high school or higher) and parental income (Danish kroner), which was normalized for inflation to 2013 using the Consumer Price Index, was obtained from the Integrated Database for Longitudinal Labour Market Research. Income, education, and employment were delineated two years prior to birth. An index of urbanicity was created based on the maternal address at the time of birth (i.e., rural areas are municipalities having towns with less than 10,000 inhabitants, provincial towns are municipalities having towns with 10,000 to 100,000 inhabitants, provincial cities are municipalities that have towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants, the suburbs of Copenhagen and Copenhagen).

The methodology for the estimation of household levels of nitrate in drinking water has been thoroughly described in previous publications. In brief, we developed a spatial model linking drinking water quality measurements from the national monitoring database, Jupiter, at the waterworks-level with the locations of all Danish household addresses. We have refined our spatial model by taking into further account historical changes in the water supply areas.

In total, we calculated annual average nitrate ion concentrations from 130,944 drinking water samples in 3,907 public waterworks taken between 1991 and 2015. Yearly averages are adequate since no seasonal variation of nitrate concentrations in Danish public supplies has been observed and levels seldom change over a year. Over the period of this study, average nitrate levels in public supplies have been gradually declining. Approximately 11% of water supply areas had a nitrate sample from more than one waterworks in a given year. In these cases, we computed average concentrations, weighted by the annual drinking water production volume of each waterworks. We imputed annual nitrate concentrations for years with missing information using linear interpolation between two sampled years or the closest observation for the tails. We only imputed data when a sample was taken within three years, otherwise no information was assigned to the water supply area/year.

### Statistical analysis

Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between nitrate and childhood cancers. Results from the primary analyses are presented for a base model, which controlled for the matching variables (sex and date of birth) by design, and for fully adjusted models that also controlled for birth order, birthweight, urbanicity, parental age, maternal smoking, education, employment, and income. Maternal and paternal age were modeled using restricted cubic splines with four knots at the quantile breaks. All other covariates were categorized and included in the models as indicator variables. The covariates for inclusion in the fully adjusted models were chosen a priori.

Nitrate concentrations were modeled as both categorical and continuous variables. Six categories of exposure were defined a priori based on the distribution of exposure in the population and their usefulness for assessing current standards. The highest category >25 mg/L is half of the current EU standard. Using a likelihood ratio test, a test of linearity for continuous nitrate exposure was performed by comparing the restricted cubic spline model with the linear model.

Results for childhood central nervous system cancers from continuous and categorical models of preconception, prenatal, and postnatal nitrate (NO3–) exposure. There were strong correlations (R² = 0.9) between the preconception and prenatal estimates of nitrate exposure. Postnatal estimates were modestly correlated with both preconception (R² = 0.6) and prenatal (R² = 0.7) estimates of nitrate exposure. Nitrate exposures declined over the time period of the study. For example, the pregnancy average exposure declined from 5.2 mg/L (SD = 8.1 mg/L) in 1991 to 3.6 mg/L (SD = 7.2 mg/L) in 2015.

We conducted analyses for the more common subtypes of leukemia and CNC. There was no indication of an increased risk in any of the subtypes of leukemia, although the results for acute myeloid and other leukemias were unstable, and there were too few cases to estimate effects in the higher exposure groups. An increased risk in the highest nitrate exposure category (>25 mg/L) was observed in all of the CNC subtypes; however, the results for embryonal tumors were somewhat stronger for preconception and prenatal exposure than those for astrocytoma or other types of CNC.

The results from modeling exposure in different trimesters of pregnancy are presented in Table 7. There was no significant evidence of an association between leukemia or lymphoma and nitrate in any of the trimester specific estimates of exposure. The strongest association for CNC with the highest category of nitrate exposure was observed in the third trimester.

The results from modelling exposure in different postnatal age windows are presented in Table 8. There was little evidence of an association between nitrate and leukemia in any of the models. There was some evidence of an increased risk in lymphoma for age 0 to 5 in the highest exposure group, but the risk of lymphoma decreased with nitrate exposure. There were too few cases to report results for CNC in the highest exposure categories. Table 5

c To preserve confidentiality, and because the difference in the number of cases between models is less than five, results are not available. ## 3.1. Sensitivity analyses

The results were largely unchanged in the sensitivity analyses in which well users were included in the analysis, and when covariates for paternal income, education, and employment status were included in the models. Including maternal pre-pregnancy BMI resulted in attenuation of the results for CNC compared to results in the main analysis. However, the results from the model with BMI were nearly identical to a model without BMI fitted to the same reduced dataset. There was no evidence of an increased risk among private well users for leukemia (OR = 1.09, 95%CI:0.81 to 1.47), lymphoma (OR = 0.98, 95%CI:0.57 to 1.69), or CNC (OR = 0.90, 95%CI:0.58 to 1.40). Finally, there was no change in our findings when the analyses were restricted to individuals who had average exposures below the current EU standard of 50 mg/L nitrate.

## 4. Discussion

Our study, with a study base of over 1.2 million births, is among the largest studies to assess the association between nitrate in drinking water and childhood cancer. We found no evidence of an association between exposure to nitrate in drinking water and an increased risk of childhood leukemia or lymphoma. We observed an increased risk of CNC in the highest exposure group (>25 mg/L) in all of our analyses. These findings were particularly strong for nitrate exposure during preconception (OR = 1.82, 95%CI:1.09 to 3.04) and during the third trimester (OR = 1.80, 95%CI:1.07 to 3.03). However, the estimates of nitrate exposure were highly correlated and thus it was difficult to identify what the critical window of exposure is. We did not observe significant evidence of an exposure–response relationship in any models of continuous nitrate exposure and any of the childhood cancers.

Our findings for CNC are somewhat consistent with the few other epidemiologic studies that have examined this association. Private well water, which generally has higher levels of nitrate than public water systems, was associated with an increased risk of childhood brain cancers in Western Washington State. In a multi-country study of nitrate in drinking water, mixed results for childhood brain cancer and private well use were reported with a significantly increased risks in two and no evidence of an increased risk in five other regions included in the study. We did not observe an increased risk with private well use, which may be explained by the small number of children that had estimates of nitrate exposure resulting in a lack of statistical power or selection bias due to the fact that only approximately 50% of the homes with wells had nitrate measurements. A significant association between astrocytoma and higher nitrite levels in tap water measured after diagnosis at the pregnancy residence was observed. An association between nitrate in drinking water and childhood brain cancer has been reported in a case-control study from Taiwan.

The most likely mechanism for the carcinogenicity of nitrate is the formation of N-Nitroso compounds that are DNA alkylating agents and mutagenic. In humans, once ingested, about 5 to 8% of nitrate is converted to nitrite in the body which may react with nitrosatable compounds to form N-Nitroso compounds in the stomach. Perinatal exposures to N-Nitroso compounds have been associated with an increased risk of CNC in both rats and monkeys. Dietary intake of cured meats during pregnancy, which contain N-Nitroso compounds or their precursors, has been associated with an increased risk of childhood brain cancers in most studies.

The epidemiologic evidence for an association with nitrate exposure is weaker for leukemia and lymphoma than it is for CNC. A population-based case-control study of childhood lymphoblastic leukemia and several water contaminants in Quebec, Canada observed a deficit of leukemia for both prenatal and postnatal exposure to average and cumulative exposure to nitrate. A pilot study using an ecologic design to examine the association between childhood cancer incidence and water contaminants in Maryland observed an increased risk of childhood leukemia in communities with nitrate concentrations in groundwater above the United States maximum contaminant level of 44.2 mg/L as nitrate ion. Epidemiologic studies of nitrate in water and leukemia and lymphoma among adults have generally had null findings.

Unexpectedly, we observed weak evidence of an excess of leukemia among children born from women in the highest income group, which might reflect co-exposure to unmeasured carcinogens or other risk factors for childhood leukemia. For example, a study in Denmark reported an increased risk of childhood leukemia among those who had a high density of crops near their homes during pregnancy, and potential exposure to herbicides which was not controlled for in our study.

Our study has a few limitations. We lacked information on dietary sources of nitrate and nitrite intake, and of antioxidants that might modify the effect of nitrate exposure on the risk of childhood cancers, and on the use of nitrosatable drugs that may promote the formation of N-Nitroso compounds. We also lacked information on amount of water consumed and water consumption outside the home. Although we did not have information on co-contaminants in drinking water, public water in Denmark is recognized to be of high quality and generally complies with legal guideline values. The nitrate exposures in our study were quite low which might explain our lack of findings for leukemia or lymphoma, or for the lower categories of exposure in the CNC analyses. Finally, we lacked information on ionizing radiation exposure which is a known cause of CNC. However, it seems unlikely that exposure to ionizing radiation from medical procedures would vary by nitrate exposures in Denmark, and environmental exposure to radon has not been associated with CNC in Denmark.

In addition to its large size, our study also has several strengths. Our ability to accurately quantify exposures at the individual level is a major advantage compared to prior studies that used ecologic estimates of exposure, measured nitrate/nitrite after diagnosis or inferred exposure from well use. Our study also benefited from the availability of high-quality data on childhood cancer and data on nearly all of the known risk factors for childhood cancer. Consumption of bottled water, which is a major potential source of exposure misclassification in prior studies, is uncommon in Denmark.

In conclusion, our study does not provide evidence that early life exposure to nitrate in drinking water increases the risk of childhood leukemia or lymphoma. We did observe an increase in the risk of CNC in the highest category of nitrate (>25 mg/L), but only observed weak evidence of an exposure–response relationship. Our results were unchanged when we only included children with average exposures less than the current EU standard, which raises concerns about the standard and the nearly equivalent MCL in the US. Additional studies are needed that consider dietary intake of nitrate and nitrite and of antioxidants that may inhibit the formation of N-Nitroso compounds, and the use of nitrosatable drugs that may promote the formation of these compounds.
