# Title: A comprehensive review on the analytical method, occurrence, transformation and toxicity of a reactive pollutant: BADGE

## Summary: This article provides a thorough review of Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), a widely used epoxy resin known for its toxicity and environmental reactivity. It discusses the production, applications, and analytical methods for detecting BADGE, as well as its occurrence in the environment and human specimens. The review highlights the need for improved understanding of BADGE's transformation processes and its potential role as an endocrine disruptor, while noting the current gaps in monitoring and research compared to similar compounds like bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS). Future studies are encouraged to focus on metabolic transformations and interactions with proteins to better elucidate the implications of BADGE in environmental and human health contexts.
