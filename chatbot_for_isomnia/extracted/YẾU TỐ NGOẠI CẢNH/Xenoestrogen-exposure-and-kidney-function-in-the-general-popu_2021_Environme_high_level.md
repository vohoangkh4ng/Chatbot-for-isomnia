# Title: Xenoestrogen exposure and kidney function in the general population: Results of a community-based study by laboratory tests and questionnaire-based interviewing

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between xenoestrogen (XE) exposure and kidney function in a community-based cohort. The study enrolled 887 participants and utilized questionnaires and laboratory tests to assess XE exposure and its impact on chronic kidney disease (CKD). Results indicated that higher XE exposure scores were negatively associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and linked to increased urinary albumin creatinine excretion. Specific xenoestrogens, such as ethylparaben and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, were identified as potential risk factors for kidney function decline, highlighting the need for further research on environmental pollutants and their health implications.
