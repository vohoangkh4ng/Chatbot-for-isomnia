# Title: Relative contribution of rice and fish consumption to bioaccessibility-corrected health risks for urban residents in eastern China

## Summary: This article investigates the dietary exposure to metal(loid)s from rice and fish consumption among urban residents in eastern China, particularly in Nanjing. It highlights the significant role of rice in contributing to carcinogenic risks, especially from inorganic arsenic (iAs), which poses a higher risk compared to fish. The study finds that rice consumption accounts for 85.0% to 99.8% of the carcinogenic risk, while non-carcinogenic health effects from metal(loid) exposure are minimal. The findings emphasize the need for attention to iAs levels in rice to mitigate health risks associated with dietary metal(loid) exposure.
