# Title: Insights into the roles of fungi and protist in the giant panda gut microbiome and antibiotic resistome

## Summary: This article explores the roles of fungi and protists in the gut microbiome and antibiotic resistome of giant pandas. Using advanced sequencing techniques, the study analyzes fecal samples from 41 giant pandas, revealing a diverse presence of protists, particularly among older individuals. The research highlights that diet significantly influences the variation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the gut microbiome. Additionally, it identifies key microbial modules that contribute to ARG variation, emphasizing the importance of protists and fungi in these processes. The findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of antibiotic resistance in the gut of endangered species, underscoring the ecological significance of microeukaryotes.
