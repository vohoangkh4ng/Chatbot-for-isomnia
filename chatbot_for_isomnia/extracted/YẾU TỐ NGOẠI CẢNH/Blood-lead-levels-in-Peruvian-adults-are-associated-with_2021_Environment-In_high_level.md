# Title: Blood lead levels in Peruvian adults are associated with proximity to mining and DNA methylation

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between blood lead (Pb) levels and DNA methylation among non-miner individuals in Peru, specifically comparing populations in Lima and Cerro de Pasco, a mining town. The study finds that individuals in Cerro de Pasco have significantly higher Pb levels, which correlate with proximity to mining activities. The research highlights the impact of low Pb exposure on physiological outcomes, including associations with hemoglobin levels and specific genes related to neurological function. The findings suggest that even low levels of Pb can significantly affect the body, particularly through changes in DNA methylation.
