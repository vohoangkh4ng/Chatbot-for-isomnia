### Background
Excessive fluoride exposure has been associated with intelligence loss, but little is known about gene-fluoride interactions on intelligence at SNP-set, gene and pathway level.

### Objectives
Here we conducted a population-based study in Chinese school-aged children to estimate the associations of fluoride from internal and external exposures with intelligence as well as to explore the gene-fluoride interactions on intelligence at SNP-set, gene and neurodevelopmental pathway level.

### Methods
A total of 952 resident children aged 7 to 13 were included in the current study. The fluoride contents in drinking water, urine, hair and nail were measured using the ion-selective electrode method. LASSO Binomial regression was conducted to screen the intelligence-related SNP-set. The gene-fluoride interactions at gene and pathway levels were detected by the Adaptive Rank Truncated Product method.

### Results
The probability of high intelligence was inversely correlated with fluoride contents in water, urine, hair and nail (all P < 0.001). The SNP-set based on rs3788319, rs1879417, rs57377675, rs11556505 and rs7187776 was related to high intelligence (P = 0.001) alone and by interaction with water, urinary and hair fluoride (P = 0.030, 0.040, 0.010), separately. In gene level, CLU and TOMM40 interacted with hair fluoride (both P = 0.017) on intelligence. In pathway level, Alzheimer disease pathway, metabolic pathway, signal transduction pathway, sphingolipid signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway interacted with fluoride on intelligence in men.

### Conclusions
Our study suggests that fluoride is inversely associated with intelligence. Moreover, the interactions of fluoride with mitochondrial function-related SNP-set, genes and pathways may also be involved in high intelligence loss.

### 1. Introduction
Fluoride distributes in nature widely. Although it is beneficial for dental caries prevention, prolonged exposure to excessive fluoride results in adverse effects, such as skeletal, dental and neurological fluorosis. More than 200 million people consume fluoride-enriched drinking water worldwide, and the number exceeds 87 million in China. Fluoride has been classified as one of the top ten chemicals of major public health concern. It is becoming increasingly evident that numerous factors are associated with intelligence. Pesticides, cadmium, arsenic, lead and mercury are acknowledged as environmental risk factors of intelligence loss. ## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Study design and population

The current study was conducted in 2015 in the rural areas of Baodi District (117◦30N, 39◦72E), Tianjin, China. As the water fluoride concentrations in rural villages kept stable over the past decade according to the annual surveillance data from the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the study areas were divided into historical high fluoride areas and normal fluoride areas. None of the study sites was exposed to excessive neurotoxins including lead, arsenic and mercury, or in the endemic areas of iodine deficiency based on the surveillance data from the local CDC. The biological samples were collected from about one-third of the total participants, using a case-control design based on a cross-sectional study. The details of participant recruitment are displayed in Fig. 1. The stratified and multi-stage random sampling method was used to select children aged 7–13 years who were permanent residents since birth from each area. All the participants and their parents/guardians provided written informed consent before study enrollment, as the subjects were minors. This work was approval for research ethics from the Review Board of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

### 2.2. General data collection

Trained investigators conducted face-to-face interviews with the recruited children and their parents to collect demographic data, including age, sex, maternal and paternal education level, family incomes, maternal exposures (smoking, drinking, passive smoking and anemia) during pregnancy, maternal delivery conditions (hypoxia, dystocia, premature birth and post-term birth) and history of cerebral trauma. Height (1 mm precision) was measured using a standard calibrated scale. Weight (0.1 kg precision) was measured without heavy clothing and shoes. All the measurements were conducted based on the recommended standard methods by nurses. The development statuses of the recruited children were further evaluated by the calculation of body mass index (BMI), derived from height and weight.

### 2.3. Sample collection

Water samples were collected from each public supply in the villages. A spot (early-morning) urine sample from each subject was also collected. Both water and urine samples were collected into sterilized, labeled polythene tubes (50 mL) and transported to the laboratory within two hours in iceboxes, then stored at -80 ◦C until analysis. A total of 96 drinking water samples and 1020 urine samples were collected.

Hair samples were collected from the occipital zone of the scalp using stainless steel scissors. Children who had their hair permed or dyed, or with hair samples less than 0.2 g (n = 250) were excluded from the corresponding analyses due to the potential contamination or lowest need for testing. Nail (fingernail/toenail) samples were collected with standard nail clippers. Children with dyed nails or with nails samples less than 0.2 g (n = 340) were excluded from the corresponding analyses. Both hair and nail samples were put into sterilized, labeled transparent plastic bags with zip-locks that can be sealed to prevent pollution, transported to the laboratory, and stored at 4◦C until analysis. A total of 770 hair samples and 680 nail samples were collected.

About 5 mL fasting peripheral blood sample was drawn from each subject into a polypropylene Na-EDTA tube. Lymphocytes were separated within 2–4 h after sample collection by centrifugation at 3000 r/min for 15 min, then transferred to 1.5 mL EP tubes and stored at -80◦C for subsequent analysis. A total of 1020 blood samples were collected.

### 2.4. Measurement of fluoride concentration

The hair sample was immersed in 75% ethanol solution for 0.5 h, stirred for 10–15 min twice, washed three times with deionized water, then placed in the oven for 5 h at 80 ◦C. After drying, the hair sample | Sampling Method | Description |

was cut into small sections of 0.5 cm. About 0.2–0.5 g samples were accurately weighed into a 10 mL tube, immersed in 10.0 mL of 2 mol/ L NaOH solution, and heated 2 h in a water bath at 85◦C, until the hair sample dissolved. After cooling, the sample solutions were filtered and adjusted to weak acidity (pH 5.0–5.5) with a dilute HCl solution, then the volume was set to 15 mL with deionized water, and 25 mL of total ionic strength adjusted buffered (TISAB) was subsequently added for measurement.

The nail specimen was cleaned with alcohol swab firstly, then placed into a 15 mL polypropylene plastic tube, and washed twice with 1% Triton X100 under ultrasound. After rinsing with deionized water and ethanol, the samples were placed in the oven at 50◦C overnight. After drying, about 0.2 g nail samples were weighted into the tube, and 1.0 mL mixed solution of 70% concentrated nitric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide (volume ratio 1:1) were added, then heated 2 h in a water bath at 80 ◦C, until the nail samples dissolved. After cooling, the sample solutions were filtered and adjusted to weak acidity (pH 5.0–5.5) with a dilute NaOH solution, then the volume was set to 15 mL with deionized water, and 25 mL TISAB solution was added further for measurement. Different from pretreatment of hair and nail samples, the drinking water and urine samples were directly diluted with an equal volume of TISAB of pH 5–5.5 for optimal analysis of fluoride ion.

The concentration detection of F [mg/L] was conducted by the national standardized ion-selective electrode method in China. For the F selected electrode (PF-202-CF, INESA, Shanghai), the detection limit was 0.01 mg/L. The measurement accuracy was between 97.3% and 101.9%, and the measurement error was less than ±5%. All the chemicals used were guaranteed reagents.

## Assessment of intelligence quotient (IQ)

IQ scores were measured by the second edition of Combined Raven’s Test – The Rural in China (CRT-RC2) for children aged 7 to 13 years. The CRT-RC2 comprises 72 nonverbal items in six sets, including A, AB and B sets (the Raven’s colored progressive matrix), and C, D and E sets (the Raven’s standard progressive matrix). Each set stands for different domains: A for perceptual awareness, B for comparative ability of similarity, C for reasoning by analogy, D for serial reasoning ability, E for abstract reasoning, while AB is a comprehensive set suitable for children and retarded intelligence population. The CRT-RC2 scale is an effective test for basic cognition, which is less affected by the difference in language, culture and ethnicity. The CRT-RC2 was completed by each child based on the instruction manual within 40 min. In each test, 40 children were randomly assigned to a classroom to finish the test independently, under four professionals’ supervision. The children’s IQ scores were categorized into seven degrees as follow: ≥130 (excellent), 120–129 (superior), 110–119 (high normal), 90–109 (normal), 80–89 (dull normal), 70–79 (marginal), and ≤69 (retarded) according to the norm of rural children in China.

## SNP selection, and DNA isolation and genotyping

Literature review and bioinformatic analysis were conducted to select genes related to mitochondrial function and involved in nervous system development. Bioinformatic tools were utilized to screen potential functional tag-SNPs of the selected genes in the Chinese population. The specific steps were as follow:
1. 547 functional genes related to human intelligence and cognition (intelligence, intellectual disabilities, cognition, cognition disorder, learning disorders, and neuro-developmental related diseases such as Autistic disorder and schizophrenia) were initially selected by literature review based on Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS), large-scale studies and meta-analysis.
2. Based on gene ontology (GO) analysis results, 60 genes involved in both nervous system development and mitochondrial biological process were further selected.
3. The genes and SNPs data of the Chinese Han Beijing (CHB) population were downloaded from the 1000 Genomes Project website, and then imported into Haploview software version 4.2. A total of 279 tag-SNPs were kept with a minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.05 in the CHB population.
4. Functional effects prediction (transcription factor binding site, splicing, miRNA, nonsynonymous SNP, stop codon, etc.) was conducted by SNPinfo Web Server online software. The predicted non-functional tag-SNPs were replaced with their pairwise linkage disequilibrium sites (set as r2 ≥ 0.8). A total of 110 functional tag-SNPs were further selected.
5. Considering the MAF of SNPs locus, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), published researches, and the predicted success rate of locus typing, 60 functional tag-SNPs from 19 candidate genes were finally identified for subsequent analysis (Table S1).

DNA was isolated from lymphocytes using a commercial DNA extraction Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and quality assessment was performed with Nanodrop ND1000. DNA was diluted to a final concentration of 200 ng/μL. Primers were designed using Primer 3 online version 0.4.0, then synthesized in the Shanghai Genomics Institute. The details of the primers are given in Table S2. An efficient multiple gene region enrichment/ next generation sequencing-based SNPseq assay was designed for SNP genotyping. The SNPs were genotyped by a three-round multiplex PCR and next generation sequencing method. The amplification procedures and reaction conditions for PCR are shown in Table S3.

Among the 60 SNPs included, 1 (rs4680) fell through the assay design, 2 (rs17554825 and rs9658258) were excluded as the genotyping call rate below 92%, and 4 (rs12098908, rs7928, rs1800844 and rs6356) did not meet Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0.05). Sixty-eight samples were excluded as the individual call rate less than 95%. Finally, 53 SNPs from 17 genes were available for the 952 subjects. Additionally, 5% of the samples were randomly selected as validation duplicates to be re-genotyped, and the concordance rate was 100%.

## Statistical analysis

The whole population was firstly divided into high (IQ ≥ 120) and non-high intelligence group (70 ≤ IQ < 120). Data were presented as mean (with standard deviation) or median (P25-P75) for continuous variables, and number (percentage/proportion) for categorical variables. The baseline characteristics and fluoride exposure levels were compared by a student’s t-test or Wilcoxon test for continuous variables, whereas a Chi-square test was used for the comparisons of the discrete data between the two groups. We calculated correlation coefficients among the four fluoride exposure indexes (water, urinary, hair and nail fluoride) by Spearman’s rank correlation analysis. Multivariable piecewise linear regression and logistic regression were utilized to examine the effects of fluoride exposure on IQ scores and the prevalence of high intelligence. In the piecewise linear regression model, the turning point was chosen according to the maximum likelihood model using the trial-and-error method, along with a log likelihood ratio test to examine the statistical significance. Linear trends across increasing tertiles of fluoride exposures on high intelligence were performed by treating fluoride indicators as ordinal variables. The selection of covariates was based on the characteristics of the study population and previous literatures.

The genotype distribution of SNPs between high and non-high intelligence group was compared by Chi-square test, and the Cochran-Armitage trend test was further conducted with the wild homozygous genotype as reference group. To develop the high intelligence-related SNP-set, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) binomial regression was applied to identify the most correlated SNPs, with the genotype coded as 0, 1, and 2 for protective homozygote, heterozygote and risk homozygote, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was further conducted to evaluate the associations of the SNPs selected by LASSO regression with intelligence by calculating the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The SNPs selected were weighted by the corresponding regression coefficients and then summed to constitute the SNP-set score. In addition, the association between SNP-set and high intelligence was assessed by calculating the ORs for SNP-set score quartiles with the highest quartile as reference, and the trend test was performed with the quartiles of SNP-set score as an ordinal variable. We also tested the gene-environment interactions between SNP-set and fluoride exposures on high intelligence by calculating the association between fluoride exposures and the probability of high intelligence stratified by the median of SNP-set score. Furthermore, to quantify the interaction effects, we included interaction terms in the multivariate logistic regression model, in which the SNP-set score and four fluoride indexes were set as binary variables according to the corresponding median levels or permissible limits (only for water fluoride).

We also investigated the associations of intelligence with genetic variations at the gene or pathway level, using the Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (ARTP) method that combines association signals from the SNPs in a given gene or from the genes in a special pathway to provide a P value at the gene or pathway level, respectively. The ARTP method was further utilized to detect the interactions between genetic variations at the gene or pathway level and fluoride exposures, stratified by sex.

3.2. Association between fluoride exposure and intelligence
Higher fluoride concentrations in drinking water, urine, hair and nail were associated with lower possibility of high intelligence (all Ptrend < 0.001 across tertiles) (Table 2). Specifically, the adjusted ORs were 0.39 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.61) for children exposed to >1.40 mg/L water fluoride compared to those exposed to ≤0.60 mg/L water fluoride, and 0.41 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.66) for children exposed to >1.80 mg/L urinary fluoride compared to those exposed to ≤0.22 mg/L urinary fluoride. For hair fluoride, the adjusted ORs were 0.16 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.29) and 0.08 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.16) when exposed to 10.41–17.02 μg/g and >17.02 μg/g, respectively, compared with ≤10.40 μg/g. Similarly, the adjusted ORs were 0.15 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.29) and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.19) when exposed to 14.65–23.41 μg/g and >23.41 μg/g nail fluoride, respectively, compared with ≤14.64 μg/g (tertile 1).

The dose-response relationships between fluoride exposures and intelligence were non-linear. Piecewise linear results showed that IQ decreased by 4.21 for every 0.50 mg/L increase in water fluoride when exceeding 3.40 mg/L. IQ decreased by 5.23 for every 0.50 mg/L increase in urinary fluoride from 1.60 mg/L, and reached stabilized up to 2.50 mg/L. For every 1.00 μg/g increase in hair and nail fluoride, IQ decreased by 2.34 and 1.10, and tended to be stable at 10.50 μg/g and 14.50 μg/g, respectively.

Besides, metabolic pathway, signal transduction pathway, sphingolipid signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway presented suggestive interactions with water fluoride and urinary fluoride on intelligence in males (all FDR correlated P = 0.074)

4. Discussion

In this population-based study, we explored gene-fluoride interactions on intelligence systematically and comprehensively. Fluoride concentrations in drinking water, urine, hair and nail were found inversely associated with intelligence scores and the probability of high intelligence. Furthermore, we found the interactions of fluoride with a SNP-set based on 5 SNPs (rs3788319, rs1879417, rs57377675, rs11556505 and rs7187776) involved in neurodevelopment and mitochondrial biological process on intelligence levels. Besides, the current study also revealed interactions of fluoride with CLU and TOMM40 on intelligence in females, and that with Alzheimer disease pathway, metabolic pathway, signal transduction pathway, sphingolipid signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in males. The interactions of fluoride with the SNP panel, genes and the neurodevelopmental pathway brought new sights to potential mechanisms of fluoride-induced neurotoxicity. Fluoride is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Excessive accumulation of fluoride in the brain contributes to neurological damage. Population-based studies suggested adverse effects of high fluoride exposure on children’s neurodevelopment, including intelligence loss and cognitive decline. Similarly, animal evidence indicated that excessive exposure to fluoride might induce deficits in attention, memory and cognition. Although numerous studies have uncovered the harmful effects of fluoride on intelligence, the exposure estimation was mainly based on water or urine samples. As relatively long-term internal exposure indicators, fluoride contents in hair and nail are crucial to reflect the chronic exposure levels. In our study, hair and nail fluoride were both positively correlated with water and urinary fluoride. Besides, increased fluoride contents in hair and nail were both associated with reduced IQ scores in non-linear model and lower possibility of developing high intelligence, which were consistent with the findings from water and urinary fluoride. Based on multiple fluoride exposures, our study suggested the potential intellectual damage caused by excessive fluoride exposure. Fig. 4.

Genetic background has been reported to play important roles in fluoride-induced adverse health effects. Polymorphisms in COL1A2 and CTR were found to alter the risk of dental fluorosis, and genetic variants in MMP-2 and VDR were significantly correlated with the severity of skeletal fluorosis. However, these studies predominantly focused on dental and skeletal fluorosis, neurotoxicity related to fluorine was rarely studied. Besides, previous studies mainly focused on single SNP analysis. However, this approach is not powerful enough to illustrate the association of candidate genes with fluorosis, especially with intelligence, which is a polygenic complex trait. A panel of SNP (SNP-set) is an effective strategy to assess the combined effects of genetic polymorphisms weakly associated with outcomes or may not be detected in single-SNP analyses, which has been widely applied in the fields of cancer and metabolic disease research. To address this issue, we performed LASSO regression to develop a SNP-set associated with intelligence. Out of the 53 SNPs in our research, five (rs3788319, rs1879417, rs11556505, rs1879417 and rs11556505) were selected, and significant association was found between the SNP-set score and high intelligence loss. Moreover, the SNP-set score presented interactions with various fluoride exposure indicators on high intelligence, although we could only roughly quantify the interaction effects stratified by the median levels or permissible limits of four fluoride indexes and the median of the SNP-set score due to the limitation of sample size. These SNPs have been reported to be associated with mental and cognitive disorders possibly by regulating genes and proteins involved in neural development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to explore gene-fluoride interactions on intelligence at SNP-set level, which brings new insights into interpreting the potential mechanisms underlying susceptibility to fluoride-induced neurotoxicity. It is therefore meaningful if our findings could be validated or similar studies could be conducted across different populations in the future. Recently, several studies have revealed the potential roles of genetic factors in the neurotoxicity caused by excessive fluoride in vivo and in vitro. For rats, COX1, COX2 and ERK/CREB signaling pathway may affect the impacts of fluoride on brain features and the memory ability by altering gene and protein expression, while NCAM and NF-kappaB were found related to fluoride-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, partially through DNA damage and oxidative stress. However, to date, limited population-based studies have been performed to uncover the genetic association with fluoride exposure on intelligence. One study reported that DRD2 altered the relationship between fluoride exposure and IQ, and another study suggested that COMT might modify the susceptibility to the intelligence loss due to fluoride exposure. In our study, ARTP was performed to evaluate the gene-fluoride interactions on intelligence at gene level, by combining SNPs in a given gene. The results showed that CLU and TOMM40 interacted with hair fluoride on intelligence, especially in females. According to the previous reports, these two genes were mainly involved in mitochondrial dynamics, and may affect the nervous system by altering mitochondrial function. The stronger interactions in females imply that the specific gender may be more vulnerable to fluoride neurotoxicity. Since the limited mechanism studies of fluoride-induced neurotoxicity and most animal studies have focused on fluoride exposure in | Water fluoride (mg/L) | SNP-set score | High group | Low group |

male rats, the exact explanations need to be explored. Taken together, our findings suggested the potential role of mitochondrial function-related genes in the development of neurotoxicity induced by fluoride, with gender difference. Considering the genetically diverse nature of populations worldwide, these interactions are required to be identified across different populations and areas in the future.

Pathway analysis provides the opportunity to combine association evidence from multiple genetic variants, thus potentially better identifying the relationships between pathways and health outcomes. In the current study, we found that Alzheimer disease pathway, metabolic pathway, signal transduction pathway, sphingolipid signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway interacted with fluoride in male children. Although we found interactions between hair fluoride with CLU and TOMM40, which were not enriched in any of the seven biological pathways in our study, no interaction between fluoride exposure with TOMM40-related pathway or CLU-related pathway was observed. Based on the published researches, these five pathways play important roles in neurogenesis, neuron growth, differentiation and survival, energy metabolism, oxidative stress and signal transduction. These neurodevelopmental physiological processes are closely related to mitochondria, and their dysfunction may contribute to the risk of cognitive disability, neurodevelopment disorders and degenerative diseases. Considering the synergistic effects of genes, it might be reasonable to observe the interaction of fluoride exposure with the above-mentioned pathways but not single genes in these pathways. However, due to the limited research till now, further studies focusing on both male and female animals with different exposure levels and periods of fluoride are still required to deeply explore the gene-fluoride interaction on intelligence, by collecting various biological samples and detecting the expression levels of key genes and proteins. Besides, the current findings need to be verified in vitro to illustrate the biological mechanisms of fluoride-induced neurotoxicity, especially at SNP-set, gene and pathway levels. In general, our findings revealed the pathways which might be involved in fluoride-induced neurotoxicity, and provided new insights for future studies to clarify the mechanisms that influence fluorosis by gene pathways on intelligence development. Notably, this is the first study to explore the neurotoxicity of fluoride at pathway level.

Our study has several strengths. Using four fluoride exposure indicators including water fluoride, urinary fluoride, hair fluoride and nail fluoride, which reflect the external and internal, and short-term and long-term exposures, makes the evaluation of fluoride exposures more comprehensive and reliable. Besides, due to the relatively rare studies on Table 4

low-to-moderate level fluoride exposure in hair and nail, our results also enrich the epidemiological evidence across different fluoride indicators and levels. Compared to previous studies which mainly focused on the effect of single SNP or gene on intelligence and its interaction with fluoride exposures, our study is the first one to explore the interactions between SNP-set and fluoride on intelligence loss. Besides, this is the first study that evaluated the gene-fluoride interactions at gene and pathway levels by using the ARTP method. Furthermore, selection bias in this study is relatively small given the comparable characteristics between the included and excluded children, along with 94.6% response rate in the multistage random sampling step.

Our study also has limitations. Due to the case-control design based on a cross-sectional study, our study has limited power in identifying the causal relationship between fluoride exposures and intelligence. However, based on the annual surveillance data from the local CDC, the fluoride contents kept stable in the study area, which makes the observed associations relatively reliable. But further studies with prospective design and repeated measures are still essential to validate our findings. Secondly, the components of the SNP-set may not be uniform across ethnicity, which limits its application in a standardized manner. However, it provides a novel approach to detect gene-environment interactions for fluorosis in other populations, and contributes primary data for future pooled analyses or multicenter studies. Due to the limited sample size, we could not draw a solid conclusion on the association between low intelligence and the five components of the SNP-set. Future studies with larger sample sizes are required to increase the statistical efficiency and precision. A limitation can’t be ignored is that some environmental risk factors such as pesticides, which are frequently used in rural areas, may contribute to children’s intelligence loss. Although these environmental risk factors might not be largely pathway level. The current findings suggest that mitochondrial function-related genes as CLU and TOMM40, and multiple neurodevelopmental biological pathways related to metabolism might be involved in the fluoride-induced neurotoxicity. Our study provides a novel insight into a better understanding of differential susceptibility of fluoride-induced neurotoxicity, which is meaningful for public prevention of fluorosis for children.
