## Background

The negative health impacts of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) have been investigated for many decades, however, less attention has been paid to the effect of TRAP on children’s academic performance. Understanding the TRAP-academic performance relationship will assist in identifying mechanisms for improving students’ learning and aid policy makers in developing guidance for protecting children in school environments.

## Methods

This systematic review assessed the relationship between TRAP and academic performance. Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Scopus and ERIC databases were searched for relevant, peer reviewed, articles published in English. Articles assessing exposure to TRAP pollutants (through direct measurement, local air quality monitoring, modelling, or road proximity/density proxy measures) and academic performance (using standardised tests) in children and adolescents were included. Risk of bias was assessed within and between studies.

## Results

Of 3519 search results, 10 relevant articles were included. Nine studies reported that increased exposure to some TRAP was associated with poorer student academic performance. Study methodologies were highly heterogeneous and no consistent patterns of association between specific pollutants, age groups, learning domains, exposure windows, and exposure locations were established. There was a serious risk of bias within individual studies and confidence in the body of evidence was low.

## Conclusions

This review found evidence suggestive of a negative association between TRAP and academic performance. However, the quality of this evidence was low. The existing body of literature is small, lacks the inclusion of high-quality exposure measures, and presents limitations in reporting. Future research should focus on using valid and reliable exposure measures, individual-level data, consistent controlling for confounders and longitudinal study designs.

## 1. Introduction and Background

When assessing the effects of environmental exposures on children and adolescents, academic performance is an important outcome. Academic performance is interlinked with health and wellbeing and predicts adulthood thriving, civic engagement, income, and occupational status.

Exposure to air pollution threatens the health of children and adolescents. It is estimated that 93% of the world’s children are continuously exposed to toxic air. The physiology, behaviour and rapid development of children and adolescents makes them more susceptible than adults to the effects of air pollution. Respiratory, cardiovascular and cognitive health have all been found to be negatively impacted. However, a relationship between air pollution and academic performance is yet to be firmly established.

This review focuses on traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), one of the biggest contributors to urban air pollution. TRAP includes vehicle emissions, re-suspended road dust and particles from degraded tyres and brake linings. These pollutants include particulate matter (PM) of varying aerodynamic diameters (ultra-fine PM: <0.1 μm [UFP], fine PM: 0.1–2.5 μm [PM2.5], coarse PM: 2.5–10 μm [PM2.5-10], and inhalable PM: <10 μm [PM10]), nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, black carbon, lead, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ground level ozone. Exposure assessment methods include personal/on site/local air quality monitoring, various modelling techniques, and road proximity/density proxy measures.

Previous longitudinal research has found a link between exposure to TRAP, specifically, and cognitive function in children – a factor closely related to academic performance. Furthermore, evidence suggests that low socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnic minority children experience higher risk of TRAP exposure at school. Therefore, it is important to know if TRAP is associated with academic performance in order to identify risk factors contributing to racial and SES related gaps in academic performance. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) provides extensive recommendations on how to protect children from TRAP exposure at school. Finding an association between TRAP and academic performance would increase the motivation to convert these recommendations into official policy.

This systematic review (SR) synthesised the evidence examining the relationship between TRAP and academic performance in children and adolescents. The research question that guided the study was: Do children and adolescents exposed to higher levels of TRAP pollutants show poorer academic performance than those exposed to lower levels of TRAP pollutants?

Eligible study designs were cross-sectional, ecological, prospective cohort, retrospective cohort, panel and case control studies.

Table 1 summarizes inclusion and exclusion criteria in the form of a PECO statement (participants, exposures, comparators, outcomes).

## 2.3. Search Strategy
The databases Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, PsychINFO, SPORTDiscus, Scopus and ERIC were searched from inception to June 13, 2020 for relevant, English-language, peer-reviewed articles.

Reference lists of found articles were manually checked for further relevant sources. The search terms combined three core components: population, exposure and outcome (Table 2) which were applied in appropriate formats for all databases.

## 2.4. Selection
Articles were uploaded into Covidence systematic review management database which automatically removes duplicates and facilitates traceable screening and selection of articles. Article selection was conducted per the PRISMA statement. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts for eligibility. Conflicts were discussed and mediated by a third reviewer before reaching final inclusion decisions.

## 2.5. Data extraction
A data collection form was developed to extract study characteristics, methods of exposure and outcome assessment, additional independent variables included in analyses, results, and funding/ conflicts of interest. One reviewer extracted data and a second reviewer verified the extraction. The main outcome under assessment was academic performance, measured by standardised tests. Effect estimates in the form of a Beta (β) coefficient, Pearson’s correlation r, risk ratio or odds ratio were extracted along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or p-values where provided. For studies reporting multiple findings, e.g. separate analyses for different pollutants/academic domains/age groups, outcome data were extracted for each analysis.

|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SES or Ethnicity        | Low SES and ethnic minority groups experience higher exposure to air pollution and both factors are independently associated with academic performance. |
| Geographic location      | TRAP levels are higher in urban areas but rural schools may have access to fewer resources which may differentially impact academic performance. |
| Temperature             | Ambient air temperature is associated with changes in air quality (particularly ozone levels) and impacts on academic performance. |
| Green space             | Higher levels of green space are typically associated with lower TRAP levels, and exposure to green space is thought to improve academic performance. |
| Co-exposures            |                                                                                                |
| Green space             | It is possible for green space and high TRAP levels to co-exist.                                 |
| Non-TRAP pollution      | Ambient pollutants from industrial sources may also affect academic performance.                   |
| Pollen                  | Pollen exposure is independently associated with poorer academic performance.                     |
| Noise                   | Traffic-noise is independently associated with academic performance.                              |

## 2.6. Data analysis

### 2.6.1. Risk of bias
Risk of bias (RoB) in individual studies was assessed using an adapted version of the OHAT tool. Bias was assessed along seven domains relevant to the articles in this SR. According to the OHAT method, key confounders and co-exposures were pre-determined. Each study was required to adjust for SES or ethnicity plus at least one other identified confounder or co-exposure which was important in relation to the primary TRAP exposure and the outcome. Studies were not penalized if other confounding variables or co-exposures were not adjusted. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias in individual studies. Conflicts were discussed before making decisions. Table 4

Fig. 2. Summary of Risk of Bias Assessments

Study characteristics are summarised in Table 4, exposure and outcome assessments are summarised in Table 5. Papers were recent, with the earliest published in 2015. There were seven cross-sectional designs, two retrospective cohort studies and one longitudinal study. Original sample sizes for the studies using aggregate, school-level, outcome data ranged from 158 to 3660 schools. For studies using data at the individual child level, original sample sizes ranged from 1450–57,025 children. In cases where specific grades were selected for the study population, these were predominantly elementary grades. One study focussed only on high school students. Study populations were limited in geographic location to high income countries, primarily the USA (n = 9), with one study in Wales, UK.
There was a wide variation in the method, spatial resolution, timing and location of exposure assessments between studies. Methods used included the use of road proximity/density around schools/homes as a proxy measure; daily Air Quality Index scores assigned using the USEPA monitoring data; and other various modelled estimates.
All studies included some variation of standardised tests as outcome measures. Six studies focussed on Mathematics and Reading/English language domains specifically, while the others used more generalised outcomes combining multiple domains. Studies were split between using individual level (n = 6), aggregate level (n = 3) or a mix (n = 1) of outcome data.

3.2. Risk of bias in individual studies

Fig. 2 displays RoB ratings allocated to each of the seven bias domains in individual studies. A summary of each RoB assessment is available in Supplementary Tables S1-S10.
The overall RoB in individual studies was graded to be serious. The most common source of bias was the use of poor quality exposure assessments of TRAP. No studies used direct readings from personal, on-site, or local air quality monitors. Excluding one paper, studies using road proximity/density proxy measures and modelled estimates did not support these with statistical comparison of modelled estimates of monitored data, or land-use regression [LUR] modelled data. Furthermore, three studies employed modelled estimates from the USEPA’s National Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) despite the USEPA explicitly stating on their website that these estimates should not be used as a freestanding capture of exposure or to compare exposures between neighbourhoods.
Eight studies controlled for SES plus at least one other confounder/co-exposure relevant to the study. The studies which adjusted for more relevant confounders/co-exposures available within the study were graded lower risk of confounding bias. Two studies did not control for any confounding factors in their analysis of the TRAP-academic performance relationship and were graded with a definitely-high RoB rating. Other common sources of bias were low quality or unreported details in the statistical analysis and a lack of information regarding the representativeness of study samples and missing data.

3.3. Publication bias

According to OHAT, when the majority of early studies in a body of evidence reject the null hypothesis, this presents a risk of publication bias. These guidelines imply that, as the field grows, more null results are likely to be presented. Therefore, potential publication bias was identified within this small and emerging body of evidence as only one study found no evidence for an association between TRAP and academic performance. Furthermore, an assessment of the frequencies of negative (decline), positive (improved) and null associations per exposure metric reveals a limited number of analysis per each different type of exposure and academic performance outcome in multiple cases (Table S11).

performance extracted in this SR are summarised in Table 6. Analyses containing full study samples were extracted while stratified analyses, presented by some authors to explore potential mechanisms or compare sub-groups, were not extracted. Only fully adjusted models were extracted if multiple models existed with different covariates included, excepting Mizen et al. who reported models controlling for multiple pollutants alongside single pollutant models. Most studies did not control for other pollutants due to collinearity, therefore, both single- and multi-pollutant models were extracted from Mizen et al. to allow accurate comparison. A total of 138 analyses were extracted. The most analyses extracted from a single paper were 72, and the least was two. Out of the 10 studies reviewed, 9 found some significant association between TRAP and academic performance. However, out of 138 extracted associations there were 38 negative associations, three positive (specifically between measures of PM2.5 exposure and academic performance in all three cases), and 97 null associations.
The study designs were highly heterogeneous, making it impossible to identify consistent patterns of association for specific combinations of individual pollutants, age groups, learning domains, exposure windows, and exposure locations. Across the papers, exposure was assessed at both homes and schools. PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone were the TRAP most included in single-pollutant analyses. Individual learning domains assessed were literacy and numeracy. Finally, effect sizes for significant associations were small in most papers.

### Confidence in the body of evidence

Overall confidence in the body of evidence was low. The evidence profile is reported in Supplementary Table S12. The studies were all observational which, per the OHAT tool, automatically grades a low initial confidence in the body of evidence. Factors lowering confidence in the body of evidence included the serious RoB within individual studies, imprecision of effects due to wide confidence intervals (CI) or a lack of reporting of CI, and the potential for publication bias. Nine papers either explicitly stated an absence of conflict of interest (COI) or reported funding sources which did not raise concerns over COI, and declared the independence of the viewpoints presented. One paper failed to report on sources of funding or potential COI.

### Discussion

#### Summary of evidence

Of the 10 articles identified, 9 found some evidence that children and adolescents exposed to higher levels of TRAP pollutants show poorer academic performance than those exposed to lower levels of TRAP pollutants. This is consistent with other research finding evidence for associations between academic performance and indoor air quality or non-traffic sources of ambient pollution. Therefore, TRAP may be another environmental factor affecting school children from which they should be protected. However, the majority of analyses extracted in this review found null associations. Furthermore, the study designs were highly heterogeneous, making it impossible to conduct any meta-analyses or to identify consistent patterns of association between individual pollutants, age groups, learning domains, exposure windows, and exposure locations. Finally, the size and emergent nature of the body of evidence raised concerns for potential publication bias. The predominance of null associations, followed by associations with declines in academic performance, indicates that it is not only papers with significant findings in one direction which are being published in this field. However, some exposure metrics are used in single studies only and these findings need to be replicated in other settings to strengthen the validity of these methods.
Important foundations have been laid for future research. In particular, the suggestion in some papers that low SES and ethnic minority groups experience a higher risk of exposure and possibly more adverse effects should be further investigated. These findings are in accordance with other studies exploring racial gaps in exposure to harmful pollutants at school, highlighting the issue of environmental injustice in school-based exposures. Policy makers should be aware that failing to protect children from TRAP at school could also exacerbate social inequalities.

#### Limitations and recommendations for future research

The current body of literature on TRAP and academic performance is small with vast room for improvement and further exploration. All studies reviewed were observational. Although it is possible to make causal inferences from observational studies where there is plausibly exogenous variation in exposure, the studies in this SR do not present robust strategies for identifying causality. Rather they rely on the inclusion of many control variables in the analysis. Experimental studies would contribute greatly to the body of evidence, however, allocating children to different levels of TRAP exposure is impracticable. One alternative is exploring interventions, for example a study found a positive association between the retrofitting of school buses to reduce toxic exposures and student health and academic performance. Such observational research could also be adapted into studies with random allocation to intervention or control groups.
It should be noted that throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, short-term reductions in air pollution and disruptions to education practices and school attendance have been observed. Therefore, the pandemic represents an additional challenge to the identification of plausibly exogenous variation missing from the current body of observational research. This strengthens the case for focussing on intervention studies, at least in the short term.
The majority of studies in this review were cross-sectional (n = 7) and, therefore, unable to estimate changes in the strength or direction of the TRAP-academic performance relationship over time. Although five studies assumed that their TRAP measures represented cumulative exposure, longitudinal research with repeated measures would be more appropriate. Such methodology has been used to find a negative association between TRAP exposure at school and cognitive development in children from the ages of 7–10 years.
The overall risk of bias in individual studies was graded to be serious. In particular, the exposure assessments selected by most studies were proxy measures which were subject to exposure misclassification and were limited in their accuracy in terms of estimated concentrations of TRAP. While the validity of the exposure metrics used is of concern, it should be noted that such proxy measures are likely to underestimate effects and bias results towards the null. Nevertheless, future studies must use valid and reliable exposure metrics and avoid using the USE-PA’s NATA modelled estimates. Personal/ on-site monitors measuring individual pollutants would provide the most accurate assessment of TRAP exposure. However, these methods are more resource intensive and would not be feasible when measuring large samples. Such trade-offs in research design mean that different studies with different strengths are needed to create a strong body of research. Therefore, personal/ on site monitoring is not the only acceptable option. Other systematic reviews exploring associations between health outcomes and TRAP exposure report heterogeneity in exposure assessments used. However, the quality of the exposure assessments identified in these reviews is higher than those found in this investigation with a greater application of LUR modelling along with air quality monitoring data and the assessment of specific pollutants. Assessing the effect of individual pollutants is important because the composition of TRAP may vary within and between different geographic areas. Multi-country research using harmonised methodologies to compare concentrations PM of varying aerodynamic diameter and assessing the ratios between PM compositions and NO2, report significant variations between different areas in Europe. Research based in China has also found that the concentrations and associated health effects of PM and ozone vary between regions. In addition, the potential confounding or co-exposure role of indoor (home and school) air pollution exposure has not been examined in this review and these factors may contribute to residual confounding effects and the inconsistent results observed between the papers in this review.
Future research should also make use of individual level outcome data, ensure consistency across studies in the use of confounders controlled for in analyses, and report and justify methods of sampling.

and statistical analysis.
To expand the scope of the present body of evidence, mechanisms and interactions of the TRAP-academic performance relationship can be explored. The predominant mechanisms of the TRAP-academic performance relationship proposed in the literature are displayed in Fig. 3. Firstly, a direct impact of TRAP on academic performance due to impaired cognitive function is proposed. UFP and PM2.5 reaches brain regions associated with learning and memory directly via the olfactory bulb and indirectly by penetrating the lungs and entering the bloodstream, causing neuro-inflammation. Further cognitive impairments include white matter damage, disruption to the dopamine and glutamine neurotransmitter systems, changes in synaptic plasticity and the presence of amyloid plaques resembling those occurring in Alzheimer’s disease. Psychological distress, headaches, disturbed sleep due to asthma exacerbation and adverse respiratory symptoms are also proposed to impair cognitive function indirectly. Alternatively, an indirect pathway between TRAP and academic performance is presented based on the increase in school absences due to ill-health associated with TRAP exposure. Relationships between asthma exacerbation, school absence and academic performance have been particularly explored, although this pathway has not been firmly established.
It is likely that both pathways influence the relationship between TRAP and academic performance, with the importance of each depending on the context of exposure. The current body of evidence includes a mix of home vs. school and short vs. long term exposure assessments. It could be hypothesised that school exposures represent more acute effects of TRAP, with health impairments such as asthma exacerbation and headaches playing a more important role. Meanwhile, home exposures may represent more chronic effects, including cognitive impairment. For example, previous literature argues that cumulative exposure to air pollution is the greatest threat to cognitive function. As the body of evidence on TRAP and academic performance grows it will become possible to compare the effects of different exposure contexts.
The relationship between TRAP, green space and academic performance should also be further explored. Green space has been recommended as an intervention to improve academic performance based on proposed restorative effects. It has also been proposed as an intervention to reduce TRAP exposure by reducing space available for cars around schools based on the finding that schools with more greenness within and surrounding the site were found to have lower ambient levels of TRAP pollutants. Future research should explore whether green space shows a positive interaction with TRAP exposure, based on restorative effects, or merely acts as an effect modifier.
### Strengths and limitations of the systematic review
This is the first SR assessing the relationship between TRAP and academic performance in children and adolescents. The small number and high heterogeneity between included papers, precluded a formal meta-analysis. Extensive recommendations for future research are made to facilitate future development of this literature.
Although the processes of assessing risk of bias in individual studies and rating confidence in the body of evidence are inherently subjective, the use of the OHAT framework involved extensive documentation and justification of decisions, maximising transparency and consistency. The selection of search terms for a SR also involves a degree of subjectivity. However, an extensive combination of terms based on similar research and key words identified in relevant papers was used. Retrieval of evidence was partially incomplete as some papers did not report numerical effect estimates for all analyses. Although authors were contacted, the data could not be retrieved.
### Conclusion
In conclusion, this review found some evidence that children and adolescents exposed to higher levels of TRAP pollutants show poorer academic performance than those exposed to lower levels of TRAP pollutants. However, this evidence was judged to be weak because the existing body of literature is small, lacks the inclusion of high-quality exposure measures, and presents limitations in reporting. Further research is required to strengthen the body of evidence and to determine the precise mechanisms through which the TRAP-academic performance relationship may operate. support with developing the search strategy
