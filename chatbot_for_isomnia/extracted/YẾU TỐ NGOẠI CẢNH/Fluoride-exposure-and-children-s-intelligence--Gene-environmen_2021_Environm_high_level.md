# Title: Fluoride exposure and childrenâ€™s intelligence: Gene-environment interaction based on SNP-set, gene and pathway analysis, using a case-control design based on a cross-sectional study

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between fluoride exposure and intelligence in children, focusing on gene-environment interactions. A study involving 952 Chinese school-aged children assessed fluoride levels in various biological samples and their correlation with intelligence. The findings indicate that higher fluoride exposure is associated with lower intelligence, and specific genetic factors may interact with fluoride exposure to influence cognitive outcomes. The research highlights the importance of understanding the genetic and environmental factors contributing to intelligence loss related to fluoride exposure.
