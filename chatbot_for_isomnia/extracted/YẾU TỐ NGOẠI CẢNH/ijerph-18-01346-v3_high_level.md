# Title: Social Media Use and Adolescentsâ€™ Sleep: A Longitudinal Study on the Protective Role of Parental Rules Regarding Internet Use before Sleep

## Summary: This longitudinal study investigates the impact of social media use on adolescents' sleep patterns, focusing on a sample of 2021 secondary school students. It explores how the frequency and problematic use of social media predict bedtime and sleep quality. The study highlights the potential protective role of parental rules regarding internet and smartphone use before sleep, suggesting that such regulations may mitigate negative effects on sleep, particularly for less engaged social media users. However, the effectiveness of these rules diminishes for adolescents who are highly engaged in social media. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the relationship between social media use and sleep issues among adolescents.
