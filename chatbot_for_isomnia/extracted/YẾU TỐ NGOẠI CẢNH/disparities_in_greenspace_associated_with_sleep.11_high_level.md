# Title: Disparities in greenspace associated with sleep duration among adolescent children in Southern California

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between environmental factors, particularly greenspace, and sleep duration among adolescent children in Southern California. It highlights that over half of adolescents do not achieve the recommended 8 hours of sleep, with urban stressors like lack of greenspace and socioeconomic status influencing sleep outcomes. The findings indicate that increased greenspace is associated with improved sleep duration, particularly for children from low socioeconomic backgrounds, while no significant association was found for those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. The study underscores the importance of addressing disparities in greenspace access to enhance sleep health in disadvantaged populations.
