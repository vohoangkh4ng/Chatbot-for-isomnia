# Title: Pharmaceuticals and other urban contaminants threaten Amazonian freshwater ecosystems

## Summary: This article discusses the significant environmental threat posed by untreated wastewater from rapidly growing urban areas in the Brazilian Amazon, which contributes to the contamination of freshwater ecosystems with pharmaceuticals and other urban chemicals. The study presents findings from the largest chemical monitoring campaign in the Amazon, revealing high levels of chemical exposure at various sampling sites. It highlights the risks to freshwater biodiversity, indicating that urban areas are hotspots for chemical pollution, with potential long-term effects on a large percentage of aquatic species. The authors call for better control of chemical pollution to mitigate biodiversity loss in the region.
