# Title: Microalgae-based technology for antibiotics removal: From mechanisms to application of innovational hybrid systems

## Summary: This review article discusses the emerging environmental issue of antibiotics contamination and presents microalgae-based technology as a sustainable and effective alternative for wastewater treatment. It explores the mechanisms of antibiotics removal, including bioadsorption, bioaccumulation, and biodegradation, while highlighting the role of extracellular polymeric substances. The article also examines factors influencing removal efficiency and novel approaches to enhance it, such as acclimation and microbial consortia. Additionally, it recommends hybrid systems that integrate microalgae with conventional treatment methods and emphasizes the need for further research to optimize these technologies for large-scale applications.
