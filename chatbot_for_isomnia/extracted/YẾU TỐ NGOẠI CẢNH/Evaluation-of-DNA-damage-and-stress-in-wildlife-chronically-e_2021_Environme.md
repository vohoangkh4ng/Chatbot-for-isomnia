# Evaluation of DNA damage and stress in wildlife chronically exposed to low-dose, low-dose rate radiation from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident

## A B S T R A C T

The health effects associated with chronic low-dose, low-dose rate (LD-LDR) exposures to environmental radiation are uncertain. All dose-effect studies conducted outside controlled laboratory conditions are challenged by inherent complexities of ecological systems and difficulties quantifying dose to free-ranging organisms in natural environments. Consequently, the effects of chronic LD-LDR radiation exposures on wildlife health remain poorly understood and much debated. Here, samples from wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax) and rat snakes (Elaphe spp.) were collected between 2016 and 2018 across a gradient of radiation exposures in Fukushima, Japan. In vivo biomarkers of DNA damage and stress were evaluated as a function of multiple measurements of radiation dose. Specifically, we assessed frequencies of dicentric chromosomes (Telomere-Centromere Fluorescence in situ Hybridization: TC-FISH), telomere length (Telo-FISH, qPCR), and cortisol hormone levels (Enzyme Immunoassay: EIA) in wild boar, and telomere length (qPCR) in snakes. These biological parameters were then correlated to robust calculations of radiation dose rate at the time of capture and plausible upper bound lifetime dose, both of which incorporated internal and external dose. No significant relationships were observed between dicentric chromosome frequencies or telomere length and dose rate at capture or lifetime dose (p value range: 0.20–0.97). Radiation exposure significantly associated only with cortisol, where lower concentrations were associated with higher dose rates (r2 = 0.58; p < 0.0001), a relationship that was likely due to other (unmeasured) factors. Our results suggest that wild boar and snakes chronically exposed to LD-LDR radiation sufficient to prohibit human

Ten years ago (March 2011) the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami damaged the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in a massive release of radioactive material into the environment. Radiation dose rates warranted evacuation of over 150,000 residents from an 1150 km2 area; herein termed the Fukushima Exclusion Zone (FEZ). Although humans were evacuated, wildlife remained within the FEZ and several generations of their progeny have now been chronically exposed to radiation levels above the safety threshold for human occupancy.

Determining dose-effect relationships to exposed wildlife in Fukushima is of keen interest because additional data could help resolve the ongoing scientific debate about potential adverse health effects associated with chronic environmental exposures to low-dose, low-dose rate (LD-LDR) radiation. For humans, the debate centers on how best to extrapolate well-established dose-effect relationships from acute, high dose rate exposures - where data are robust - to effects from chronic, LD-LDR exposures (<100 mGy total; <6 mGy/h), where data are sparse and have much larger uncertainties. In contrast, the debate on dose-effect relationships in wildlife exposed to LD-LDR is not about extrapolation. Instead, it is about discrepancies in reported effects and the radiation doses to which they are attributed. The ongoing inconsistencies highlight the need to reduce uncertainties in environmental dose-effect relationships.

Resolving these issues is important to science and public policy because a better understanding of the biological effects to wildlife exposed to chronic LD-LDR radiation is required to improve environmental risk analyses. Clarity would also aid human risk assessors in making more informed decisions about human use of environs contaminated with radioactive materials. Indeed, lingering radiation from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident is a major concern of former residents and reduces their willingness to resettle remediated areas.

To provide quantitative data that will help address uncertainties in dose-effect relationships from LD-LDR exposures, we investigated in vivo biomarkers of DNA damage and stress - specifically, dicentric chromosomes, telomere length, and cortisol levels - in wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax) from the FEZ and nearby less contaminated areas. We also examined telomere length in Japanese rat snakes (Elaphe spp.). Both are common species in the FEZ but with vastly different life history strategies.

Dicentric chromosomes are informative biomarkers of radiation-induced DNA damage because they result from mis-repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs), producing a chromosome with two centromeres (primary constrictions) instead of one. Radiation dose-effect relationships for dicentric chromosome frequencies are well established for acute, high dose rate exposures, and they are the preferred method for retrospective biodosimetry in humans. Far less is known about the utility of dicentric chromosome frequencies as a biodosimeter for wildlife under chronic LD-LDR exposures. Thus, we chose dicentric frequencies not as a retrospective biodosimeter, but as an effect biomarker of DNA damage resulting from chronic LD-LDR radiation exposures.

In addition to increased DNA damage, we hypothesized that wildlife would experience increased levels of stress in response to chronic radiation exposure. Such a scenario is consistent with a recent interdisciplinary synthesis for environmental radiation protection that proposed biomarkers of stress may better measure impacts of radiation within the environment than DNA mutational assays. The rationale was that with LD-LDR exposures there is a cumulative effect from multiple small doses (perhaps not individually detectable using classic DNA damage assays) that combine with the effects from other environmental stressors, such as predation, other contaminants, reproduction, food limitation, human disturbances, etc. Coping with prolonged stress is of particular concern for wildlife because it may divert resources from biological functions such as reproduction, growth, and/or immune competence.

Therefore, we evaluated two biological indicators of stress: telomere length (a molecular biomarker) and cortisol levels (a hormonal biomarker). Telomeres are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with cell division and thus with aging, such that telomere length is predictive of organism longevity. Telomere length is also influenced by a variety of chronic stressors and environmental exposures. Telomeres are regarded as “sentinels” of such exposures and have been proposed specifically as hallmarks of radiosensitivity. Indeed, telomere shortening has been associated with increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, genomic instability, and cancer development. Cortisol concentrations also provide a measure of stress, as they reflect activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Furthermore, chronically increased levels of circulating cortisol have been associated with telomere shortening and DNA damage, supportive of cortisol levels being an integrative biomarker for quantifying stress to wildlife from chronic radiation exposures.

Using these effect endpoints, we examined dose-response relationships in wild boar and rat snakes to test the hypotheses that increased DNA damage (dicentric chromosomes), shorter telomeres, and elevated concentrations of cortisol would be associated with chronic LD-LDR exposures in Fukushima’s most radioactively contaminated areas. The research from this multi-disciplinary approach advances our understanding of dose-effect relationships derived from chronic LD-LDR exposures to wildlife living in radioactively contaminated environments.

# Methods

## Study sites

At the time of our research, the FEZ had been reduced in size from its original 1150 km2 to approximately 350 km2 of restricted land where dose rates still exceeded the safety threshold (>50 mSv/y) set by the Japanese government for human habitation. Restricted access to Fukushima’s most contaminated areas has hindered important research on biological effects of LD-LDR. More recently, however, we were able to obtain samples from within the FEZ, as well as from less contaminated, non-restricted areas within Fukushima Prefecture and the neighboring Prefecture of Tochigi to the south-west (wild boar - Fig. 1; snakes - FIGURE S1; Table and Figure numbers preceded by an ‘S’ are 2.2. Biota samples
were processed within 48 h. Additional blood samples were collected via cardiocentesis using K2-EDTA vacutainer tubes.

2.2.1. Wild boar
In Japan, wild boar are often considered pests and populations are trapped throughout the country by government-sponsored culling programs, including within the FEZ. We were given access to their live-trapped animals within the FEZ and neighboring areas between June 2016 and July 2018. No animals were killed specifically for this research.
Wild boar captured in 2016 were used to determine dicentric chromosome frequencies (n = 39) and telomere length (n = 37) via fluorescence in situ hybridization (Telo-FISH). A second cohort of wild boar captured in 2018 (n = 45) was used for telomere length analyses via qPCR. Hair samples from both cohorts, and four wild boar captured in 2017, were used for cortisol analyses (n = 33).
GPS coordinates were recorded for each trap site and ambient dose rates (μSv/h) measured at a 1-m height above ground with a Hitachi ALOKA TSC-171 NaI(Tl) scintillation survey meter. Field measurements included animal mass, sex, and age based on tooth eruption and wear patterns.
From each euthanized wild boar, ~100 g of bicep tissue was removed for laboratory analyses of radioactive cesium (Cs) isotopes. Immediately post-mortem, peripheral blood was collected in

Points from individuals captured in the same location were moved fractionally so that all points are visible. areas in May-August 2018. Upon capture, GPS locations were recorded, and ambient dose rates (μSv/h) were measured adjacent to the road at the standard height of 1-m above the ground. Snakes were transported back to IER to obtain sex and morphological measurements (tail length, snout-vent length, mass), and to measure radioactivity concentrations in the live animal. Blood samples were taken from 20 snakes via the ventral coccygeal vein or cardiocentesis for telomere length analyses (qPCR). Blood was collected into K2-EDTA vacutainer tubes and stored at -80◦C until further processing. All snakes were returned alive to their capture locations within 1–3 days.

## 2.3. Molecular analyses

Frequencies of dicentric chromosomes in wild boar were evaluated manually using Telomere-Centromere Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (TC-FISH), and blinded scoring of images was performed by two independent researchers. Telomere length was assessed using two standard assays: Telomere FISH (Telo-FISH) and qPCR. Although cell-by-cell analyses by Telo-FISH are more informative, it is also more time- and labor-intensive, as it involves imaging and analyses of individual cells. While qPCR is faster and amenable for larger sample sizes, it only provides average telomere length for an entire sample, not individual telomere length data points for distribution analyses. We utilized both methodologies in wild boar for the most comprehensive view. However, the only feasible option for snakes was isolation of DNA from blood samples for qPCR assessment of telomere length, as blood volumes were small, and the field collections were not compatible with timely laboratory analyses.

### 2.3.1. Dicentric chromosome and telomere length analyses for wild boar

Blood sample preparation: Peripheral blood was stimulated in medium composed of RPMI-1640 + L-glutamine, 30% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution, 50 ng/mL Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and 1 μg/mL ionomycin. After 68 h of incubation at 37 ◦C, colcemid was added at a concentration of 0.1 μg/mL. The cells were harvested after 72 h of total incubation time and fixed in a 3:1 methanol:acetic acid solution. Metaphase spreads were prepared using standard cytogenetic techniques.

Dicentric chromosome analysis by TC-FISH: Prepared slides with metaphase chromosome spreads were hybridized with a fluorescently labeled telomere probe (Cy-3) and a specially developed pig centromere probe (FITC). Procedures for slide preparation, hybridization with fluorescent probes and storage are detailed in Supplement-S2. Metaphase chromosome spreads (100/sample) were visually inspected for dicentric chromosomes and imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ni-U epifluorescent microscope equipped with an Ando Zyla 5.5 sCMOS camera and SpectraX LED light source. Although more dicentrics are scored when used to estimate radiation dose, many fewer are scored for preliminary dose estimations. Here, dicentrics were used as biomarkers of radiation-induced DNA damage; thus, the probability of detecting a relationship would be expected by evaluating 100 metaphase spreads per individual.

Telomere length assessment by Telo-FISH: For telomere length estimations, metaphase chromosome spreads (30/sample) were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ni-U epifluorescent microscope equipped with an Andor Zyla 5.5 sCMOS camera and SpectraX LED light source. Stacked images (5 images/stack, 0.3 μm step size) were taken of each metaphase spread. Fluorescence intensity of telomere signals was quantified using the ImageJ plugin, Telometer, and normalized using the mouse lymphoma control cell line LY-S, as per Wong and Slijepcevic, and age-sex matched controls.

### 2.3.2. Acute in vitro radiation dose-responses for wild boar

Because little is known about dicentric chromosome frequencies and telomere length in porcine, we first sought to confirm that they respond to acute radiation exposures under controlled laboratory conditions as expected. Simulation of relevant chronic radiation exposure in vitro was not feasible. Blood samples were collected from wild pigs in Arkansas and Georgia, USA, and shipped under ambient conditions to Colorado State University for analyses. Blood samples from each wild pig were divided into seven separate aliquots, which were irradiated in vitro at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1 and 2 Gy using a137Cs gamma-ray Mark I irradiator. Immediately after exposure, samples were incubated, and metaphase spreads prepared as described. Frequencies of dicentric chromosomes were quantified (TC-FISH, 100 metaphase spreads/sample), and telomere length determined (Telo-FISH, 30 cells/sample). Sample ID numbers were randomized, and slides scored blindly.

### 2.3.3. Telomere length assessment by qPCR for wild boar and snakes

Nucleic Acid Extraction: Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kits were used to extract DNA from whole blood of wild boar captured in Japan for qPCR telomere length measurements. DNA was extracted in Japan, then stored at -80◦C until shipped to Colorado State University in liquid nitrogen. Once received, samples were again stored at -80 ◦C. DNA concentration and purity were determined.

qPCR: Multiplexed telomere length measurements were determined by qPCR using the following primers for wild boar and rat snakes:

telomere forward primer: TelG: 5′-ACACTAAGGTTTGGGTTTGGGT TTGGGTTTGGGTTAGTGT-3′;
telomere reverse primer: TelC: 5′-TGTTAGGTATCCCTATCCCTATCC CTATCCCTATCCCTAACA-3′;
boar albumin forward primer: AlbU:5′-CGGCGGCGGGCGGCGCG GGCTGGGCGGAAATGCTGCACAGAGTTCTTG-3′;
boar albumin reverse primer: AlbD: 5′- GCGCGGCCCGCCGCG CCCGTCCCGCCGGAAAAGCAAGGCCGTCTGTT-3′;
snake 12S ribosomal DNA forward primer: 12S-F: 5′-CGGCGGC GGGCGGCGCGGGCTGGGGACGGTGCCTCAAAACAACTAG-3′;
snake 12S ribosomal reverse primer: 12S-R5′-GCCCGGC CCGCGCGCCCGTCCCGCCGGGGTATCGGTTATTAGACAGGC-3′.

A control pool of DNA for each species was created using 20 μL from individual DNA samples collected from wild boar and snakes outside of the FEZ, which served as the DNA source for establishing the standard curves.

## 2.4. Cortisol concentrations in wild boar hair samples

Blood, saliva, urine, and feces are commonly used for the analysis of cortisol. However, changes in cortisol levels within these matrices represent stress responses in time spans of minutes to one or two days. Cortisol levels in hair samples are more appropriate for assessing chronic stress from long-term activation of the HPA axis, as might occur from chronic exposure to contaminants. Animal studies demonstrate that a wide array of stressors can alter cortisol concentrations in hair, and that hair cortisol concentrations provide a reliable and valid marker of long-term stress in many species. K. Cunningham et al.
Environment International 155 (2021) 106675

in Heimbürge et al., 2019). Cortisol extractions and quantification (Supplement-S2) were conducted using established protocols with commercially available, highly sensitive Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) kits. Hair samples were first gently washed using a water rinse to remove any soil or blood contaminants, and then 5–6 strands of hair from each boar were selected, measured (average = 5.0 cm), and weighed (average = 17.5 mg). Hair follicles were excluded because they often contain trace amounts of blood and would represent the current circulating glucocorticoid levels rather than concentrations indicative of longer time periods in hair.

2.5. Dosimetry

Animals receive an internal dose from radionuclides consumed in contaminated food or water, and an external dose due to irradiation from contamination in their environment, particularly radiation emitted from contaminated soil. Both internal and external doses were determined for individual wild boar and snakes based on their exposure to 134Cs and 137Cs. (Supplement-S1). Analysis of other radionuclides was not necessary because short-lived radionuclides released from the accident (such as 131I with an 8-day physical half-live) had decayed away by the time samples were collected in 2016, and the release of radionuclides with longer half-lives, such as 90Sr and Pu isotopes, was so low that they do not contribute appreciably to dose.
Internal dose rates for wild boar were obtained from laboratory measurements of 134Cs and 137Cs activity concentrations (Bq/kg) in muscle tissues taken from each animal carcass. Dose conversion coefficients (DCCs) specific to the energy emitted by 134Cs and 137Cs, as well as the size of each animal, were generated within the ERICA Assessment Tool (version 1.3, updated May 2019). DCCs convert the measured activity concentrations to internal dose rates (μGy/h) at the time each animal was captured.
Internal dose to snakes was derived from 134Cs and 137Cs activity concentrations (Bq/kg) in the live animals, determined from whole body analyses using gamma spectrometry in the laboratory. To determine the efficiency of the whole-body counting system, snake size-specific gamma counting efficiency curves (Bq per counts/s) were constructed using software associated with the analytical systems. Details are provided in Gerke et al. (2020). DCCs specific to the energy emitted by 134Cs and 137Cs, as well as the size of each snake, were generated within the ERICA Assessment Tool.
The best estimate of external dose rate at capture (μGy/h) for wild boar was ambient dose rate (μSv/h) at the trap location. External dose rates to snakes were estimated from 134Cs and 137Cs activity concentrations in soil samples taken within the 50% core home range area of GPS-tracked snakes. Radiocesium concentrations in soil are often used to estimate an organism’s external dose rate. Radionuclide- and animal size-specific DCCs were generated in the ERICA tool and multiplied by radioactivity concentrations in the soil samples to derive external dose rates (μGy/h) for each snake. The external dose rates based on soil activity concentrations were confirmed by a subset of free-ranging snakes with attached dosimeters.
We recognize the uncertainties in trying to estimate an animal’s external dose as it ranges freely among many habitats that vary widely in contaminant densities, and the enlargement of those uncertainties when estimating lifetime dose. However, we hypothesized that some effect endpoints, such as cortisol levels in hair samples, are likely influenced most by an animal’s radiation exposure over the near-term (weeks to months), whereas other endpoints, such as telomere length, might be influenced more by an animal’s long-term exposure (years), because the effect tends to accumulate over time. Thus, to explore the influence of exposure duration on radiation effects to wild boar we estimated the internal plus external dose rate (μGy/h) experienced by each animal at capture, as well as its “plausible upper bound lifetime dose” (mGy) based on the individual’s age, as was done in a study of cataract prevalence in Fukushima wild boar. We conservatively selected values in the lifetime dose calculation to be at a plausible upper-bound level by selecting values to maximize each animal’s internal and external dose, as is often used in a multi-tiered risk analysis. If effects are not observed at the conservative, upper-bound dose then researchers can be confident that the same effect was not observed in animals exposed to the lesser, realistic, but unknown dose. To estimate plausible upper bound lifetime internal doses for wild boar, internal dose rates (μGy/h) at capture were multiplied by the age of the animal. To obtain a more plausible upper bound internal lifetime dose, the increased contribution of 134Cs during the earlier period of each boar’s life was back-calculated based on the 2.1 y physical half-life of 134Cs. To maximize each wild boar’s external lifetime dose, we: (1) used the highest dose rate value from an area twice as large as the typical boar’s home range. The highest dose rate was obtained from dose rate distribution maps generated from aircraft fly-over data produced annually by the Japanese government; (2) selected a map that was generated when the animal was young and 134Cs levels were the greatest; and (3) multiplied the conservatively chosen dose rate by the animal’s age. While determining radiation dose to free-ranging animals has considerable uncertainties, our method of estimating plausible upper bound lifetime dose permits dose–effect relationships to be explored for cumulative doses and adds significant strength to the study. For snakes, only dose rates (μGy/h) at capture were determined. No attempt was made to estimate their lifetime dose (mGy) because it was not possible to accurately estimate their ages.

2.6. Visualizations and statistical analyses

2.6.1. Visualizations
All visualizations were generated in Python within Jupyter notebooks using Pandas and Seaborn libraries. Briefly, lmplot, regplot, boxplot, and heatmap class objects from Seaborn were utilized in combination with extensive configurations via Matplotlib to generate figures and perform pairwise simple linear regressions (lmplot/regplot). Heatmaps relating distributions of individual telomere length (short, medium, long) and lifetime dose, as well as dose rate measurements in boar were generated with Seaborn. With the Seaborn heatmap class object, all individual telomeres (per experiment) from all wild boar were separated into robust quantiles, with color maps applied to each quantile. Individual telomeres for each wild boar’s distribution were then colored using the population-level quantile colormap.

2.6.2. Linear modeling
Suitability of linear modeling for all biomarker endpoints was evaluated using routine methods: Q-Q plots, residuals vs. fitted values plots, and the Harvey-Collier test. Many types of models, parameter changes, and data normalization approaches were performed to ensure that significant relationships were not missed. Four separate multivariable Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression models were generated to analyze linear relationships of plausible upper bound lifetime dose, dose rate at capture, age, and sex on various endpoints (dicentric frequencies, mean telomere length).

3. Results

3.1. Data summaries

Summary statistics and distributions (mean ± sd, minimum, 25%, median, 75%, and maximum) for animal age, dose rates at capture, plausible upper bound lifetime dose and effect endpoints assayed (dicentric frequencies, telomere length [Telo-FISH, qPCR], and cortisol levels) are provided for wild boar (Table 1) and snakes (TABLE S2).

3.2. Dicentric chromosomes

An acute in vitro dose response curve for dicentric chromosomes was established to confirm their usefulness as a biomarker of radiation-induced DNA damage in wild boar. Consistent with expectation, wild pig peripheral blood acutely irradiated in vitro displayed a linear quadratic relationship between dicentric chromosome frequencies and radiation dose. In sharp contrast to the acute in vitro exposures, Japanese free-ranging wild boar exposed to chronic LD-LDR radiation showed no significant relationship nor discernible trends between dicentric chromosome frequencies.

3.3. Telomere length

In addition to mean telomere length, Telo-FISH facilitates the generation of individual telomere length distributions. Monitoring telomere length distributions is particularly informative, as individual differences in populations of short and long telomeres are revealed. To confirm that telomere length in porcine responds to radiation exposure, telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes was determined from in vitro irradiated samples. For acute in vitro radiation exposures, a non-linear trend toward increased frequencies of short telomeres occurred with increasing dose. A | B

Most pronounced were increased frequencies of short telomeres in samples irradiated at the highest dose (2 Gy) compared to non-irradiated (0 Gy) control samples.

However, for the chronically exposed Fukushima wild boar, there was a wide range in mean telomere length (Telo-FISH from 0.28 to 1.47; qPCR from 0.71 to 1.72; Table 1), and no significant relationships with lifetime dose, dose rate at capture, or age were found when analyzed by a simple linear regression (p values range: 0.45–0.97; Fig. 3, TABLE S3). There was also no significant relationship between telomere length and sex (p = 0.39), consistent with previous findings in domestic pigs (Fradiani et al., 2004). Analysis by a GAM also failed to reveal significant relationships between wild boar telomere length and dose rate at capture, or lifetime dose (p values range: 0.30–0.97; Table 2).

Telomere length (qPCR) of snakes ranged from 0.21 to 2.07 (x ± sd: 0.84 ± 0.43; TABLE S2) and showed an overall negative trend with dose, yet when analyzed by simple linear regression no significant relationship was found with dose rate at capture (p = 0.32; r2 = 0.13; FIGURE S5). There was also no correlation between mean telomere length (qPCR) and sex (p = 0.29; TABLE S3). No significant relationships were found when analyzed by a GAM (p = 0.32; Table 2).

### Cortisol levels

Cortisol levels in wild boar averaged 10.9 ± 9.4 pg/mg and ranged from 4.2 to 51.4 (Table 1). When analyzed by simple linear regression (Fig. 4; TABLE S3), there were no significant relationships between cortisol levels and radiation dose rate at capture (range: 0.1–20.1 μGy/h; p = 0.11), or lifetime dose (range: 1–1660 mGy; p = 0.19). However, when analyzed with a GAM model, significantly lower levels of cortisol in wild boar hair were associated with higher radiation dose rates at capture, indicating an inverse, non-linear relationship (r2 = 0.58; p < 0.0001; Table 2). Significance was lost when evaluating cortisol levels relative to lifetime dose (p = 0.48) and age (p = 0.86) (Table 2). The response of cortisol in hair to dose rate at capture, rather than lifetime dose, supports its use as a relatively short-term biomarker of stress.

### Discussion

During the 10 years since the nuclear accident occurred in Fukushima, wildlife in the FEZ have been continuously exposed to radiation levels that prohibit human occupancy. Evaluating their health represents a rare opportunity to better understand the effects of LD-LDR exposures. Herein, we report on three integrative dose-effect relationships indicative of health effects on wild boar and rat snakes captured in and around the FEZ. Collectively, our results suggest that the doses experienced by these animals were not sufficient to cause deleterious health effects as assessed by biomarkers of DNA damage (dicentric chromosomes) and stress (telomere length and cortisol concentrations).

#### Dosimetry

The dose-effect data reported herein are derived from among the most comprehensive dosimetry published to date on large, free-ranging mammals. Internal dose was based on radioactivity concentrations (Bq/kg) measured precisely under laboratory conditions for each individual wild boar and snake. In contrast, most internal dose estimates are derived from average soil contamination levels multiplied by a generic Concentration Ratio (CR) that converts soil activity concentrations (Bq/kg) to an animal’s internal dose rate (μGy/h). The use of CRs increases uncertainty in estimating internal dose because soil radionuclide contamination levels are highly variable (Mikami et al., 2015; Kato et al., 2018), and typical sampling regimes are insufficient to capture spatial contaminant heterogeneity. More importantly, CRs are aggregated empirical ratios that do not distinguish the specifics of contamination levels in dietary items or ingestion patterns (Hinton et al., 2019). Because of the large inherent variabilities in published CRs (typically three to four orders of magnitude; IAEA, 2014), they are intended to be used as “first-order estimates’’ within screening-level environmental risk assessments (Wood et al., 2013), not within detailed dose-effect research (Anderson et al., 2019). Thus, our individual-based radioactivity measurements on wild boar and snakes elevate the precision of the internal dose estimates, providing increased confidence in observed dose-effect relationships.

The estimation of external dose to free-ranging wildlife is particularly challenging because of the difficulty in accounting for the time an animal uses various habitats within its home range and the spatial variability of contaminant density within those habitats (Hinton et al., 2019). However, the estimation of external dose is particularly important because it is often the major contributor to total dose. External dose made up 80 ± 17% of the total (i.e., external + internal) dose rate at capture for wild boar in 2016, decreasing to 64 ± 24% in 2018 (largely due to physical decay of 134Cs). External dose also comprised approximately 80% of the total for snakes in our study (Gerke et al., 2020). Our external dose estimates incorporated species-specific home range sizes and their corresponding contamination levels (Supplement S1), which was shown in a study of Chernobyl wolves wearing GPS-dosimeter collars to be more accurate than using average contamination levels decoupled spatially from an animal’s home range (Hinton et al., 2019). Collectively, these methods quantified both internal and external radiation dose rates at time of capture with a greater accuracy than is typical in studies on free-ranging wildlife. The dosimetry for wild boar was enhanced further by estimating their plausible upper bound lifetime dose (mGy), based on conservative measures and animal specific age estimates.

#### DNA damage and molecular level endpoints

DNA damage is considered the key event by which radiation induces development of cancer and hereditary diseases (UNSCEAR, 2000). Dicentric chromosomes result from mis-repair of ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage, and although they persist following formation, they are lost with time after exposure. In humans, frequencies of dicentrics declined with a half-time of 14 months following acute exposure from a radiological accident (Bauchinger et al., 2001). Moreover, the unknown dynamics of new dicentrics forming under chronic exposure regimes while older ones are being lost makes it challenging to use dicentrics as an estimator of dose. Therefore, dicentrics were used here as a biomarker of radiation-induced DNA damage, not as a biodosimeter, per se. The efficacy of detecting dicentrics was enhanced by employing TC-FISH (Section 2.3.1; FIGURE S2) (M’kacher et al., 2014), which required development of pig-specific centromere probes (KromaTiD, Inc.). Dose-dependent dicentric chromosome formation was confirmed in wild boar following acute in vitro radiation exposures (Section 2.3.2, FIGURE S2). Although some dicentric chromosomes were observed in wild boar experiencing chronic LD-LDR radiation exposures at Fukushima (ranging from 0 to 5, median = 1.1, per 100 cells in 39 animals), frequencies did not rise to the level of significance with lifetime dose or dose rate at capture.

Two factors likely contributed to the lack of significant increases in dicentric chromosome frequencies in free-ranging wild boar at Fukushima. Foremost is the relatively low dose rates and lifetime doses experienced by the wild boar in our study. Median dose rates of 0.05–0.09 mGy/d and maximum dose rates of ~0.5 mGy/d were measured for wild boar captured in the FEZ between 2016 and 2018 (Table 1). A lack of significant effects at median dose rates <0.1 mGy/d agrees with expectations suggested by the International Commission for Radiological Protection (ICRP, 2008). The ICRP’s Derived Consideration Reference Levels (DCRL) of 0.1–1.0 mGy/d for large mammals is a “band of dose rate within which there is some chance of deleterious effects from ionizing radiation occurring to individuals” (ICRP, 2008). Median dose rates to wild boar of 2–4 μGy/h were also below the other commonly used generic ‘predicted no effect dose rate’ of 10 μGy/h. Nonetheless, these dose rates are larger than the mean dose rates experienced by wild boar in our dicentric study (~0.1 mGy/d; Table 1). Fujita et al. (2014) also conducted molecular effect studies on Fukushima wild boar at similar dose rates to those in our study (0.07 mGy/d) and found no radiation-induced effects. However, differences in dose rates alone do not explain all the disparities in results seen in prior studies at Fukushima. For example, no molecular damage was observed in cattle exposed to dose rates of 0.2–0.4 mGy/d, similar to Nakamura et al. (2017). Likewise, Fujishima et al. (2020) found no molecular damage in rodents exposed to 0.7 mGy/d. A study of humans living in Japan one year after the incident found increased frequencies of chromatid-type aberrations, chromosomal fragments, and micronuclei, and similar to our findings, no significant difference in dicentric chromosome frequencies; however, there was no dose quantification to link to radiation exposures. Further, no increased levels of dicentrics were found in humans traveling to Fukushima shortly after the accident.

Two other molecular level studies have been conducted on mammals exposed to Fukushima contamination. The expression of immunity-related genes was altered in the small intestine of wild boar - although doses were not determined - and plasma protein levels and enzymes were altered in cattle exposed to a median dose rate of 0.03 mGy/d.

### 4.3. Biomarkers of stress and individual level endpoints

We hypothesized that dose-dependent changes in telomere length would reflect stress associated with chronic LD-LDR exposures at Fukushima. However, no significant relationships were observed between telomere length and lifetime radiation dose (wild boar), nor between telomere length and dose rate at capture (wild boar and snakes). The impact of pollutants on telomere length is a rather new field of research in environmental toxicology, and data collections are currently inadequate to formulate generalized trends relative to telomere dynamics in wildlife. The inadequacy is symptomatic of abundance.

Aber.” = Chromosome aberration. problems in the science backing ecological risk analyses, which is far less developed than that supporting human risk analysis. Ecological risk suffers from a lack of sufficient data to guide practitioners on which level of observation (i.e., individual, population, community) and effect-endpoint (e.g., molecular or cellular damage, sublethal impacts, decreased fecundity, increased mortality) best serves as the sensitive, early warning biomarker of pending harm. The impacts of chronic, LD-LDR radiation exposures to wildlife are highly contested and much debated in the radioecological literature. Additionally, LD-LDR research constitutes a scientific challenge because we lack sensitive methods to detect and reliably quantify relevant biological effects in the low dose range. All dose-effect studies conducted outside controlled laboratory conditions are challenged by inherent complexities of ecological systems and difficulties quantifying dose to free-ranging organisms in natural environments. The nature of wildlife research further complicates the interpretation of results given that there is no simple way to account for natural confounding factors.

The lack of a telomere length dose response in wild boar in our study is likely due to the low dose rates they experienced, and/or because the wild boar captured were relatively young, with a mean age slightly over 1 year (Table 1). That argument may be more tenuous for snakes, because we could not determine age, but also because so little is known about the potential effects of radiation on reptiles and the doses at which they occur. Poikilothermic reptiles such as snakes have distinctly different physiological processes than mammals, including processes related to aging, stress adaptation, and possibly DNA repair. Although not well-studied in reptiles, some studies indicate telomere dynamics can vary by species, age, and/or sex, and that reproduction-related stressors can increase DNA damage and telomere erosion. Additionally, Bronikowski showed long-lived snakes have more efficient DNA repair than short-lived species, suggesting a link between lifespan, stress, and repair mechanisms. Both species of rat snakes in this study can live 14+ years (some insular populations reach 40 years), but the relationship between telomere dynamics and growth in these species has not been explored. One primary challenge in understanding telomere dynamics is identifying cause and effect, particularly in field settings with confounding variables. Although dose rates to snakes are well documented here, drawing definitive conclusions about the lack of a telomere-dose relationship is difficult, given the level of dose that may be harmful to snakes is unknown. The ICRP has no radiation benchmarks for reptiles, despite reptiles possessing attributes that make them vulnerable to contaminant accumulation and radiation exposure.

Our results are potentially suggestive of lower levels of stress in wildlife living in the FEZ because of reduced disturbance from human activities and enhanced food resources within abandoned agricultural areas. This interpretation would agree with studies on free-ranging bears and lions; both species demonstrated increased cortisol levels when disturbed by humans. Similarly, the recent “anthropause” caused by reduced human activity during the pandemic is expected to improve conditions for some wildlife species. Given the direct contact snakes have with contaminated soil, we expected their external dose rates to exceed that of wild boar from the same areas. Such was not the case. The mean dose rate for rat snakes was about half the mean dose experienced by boar, and the maximum dose rate for snakes was well below the maximum for boar. One conceivable explanation is that rat snakes were spending considerable time in trees well away from the primary external source term of contaminated soil, and thus had an equally reduced external dose. However, modeling the impact of such habitat selection by rat snakes found that an arboreal residence only slightly reduced external dose rates. A more plausible explanation is the difference in ambient dose rates at the capture sites.

In addition to our cortisol analyses, eight other studies have been conducted on mammals at the level of biological organization that we term “individual,” with two studies on monkeys showing harmful effects as a function of radiation exposures. Neither study determined dose but compared effects to activity concentrations of cesium isotopes in the body of animals. The other individual-level studies found no relationship of radiation exposures to spermatogenesis, characteristics of testes, developmental ability of oocytes, histological characteristics of ovaries, or frequency of cataracts.

Our wild boar data are part of a research line conducted at several levels of biological organization and designed specifically to address the uncertainties regarding effects of chronic LD-LDR exposures on free-ranging wildlife. Studying the same population of wild boar, Lyons et al. found wild boar to be the most abundant in the FEZ and concluded: “…if any effects of radiological exposure in mid-to large-sized mammals in the Fukushima Exclusion Zone exist, they occur at individual or molecular scales, and do not appear to manifest in population-level responses.” The molecular and hormonal assays reported herein on the same populations of wild boar now expand the population-level research by Lyons et al. Collectively, our wild boar LD-LDR dose-effect data are among the most comprehensive studies because they span more levels of biological organization (from molecular to individual to population) than any other published data set examining radiation effects to free ranging mammals. To date, our results provide no evidence of significant deleterious impacts to wild boar chronically exposed to LD-LDR radiation at molecular (dicentrics, telomeres), individual (cortisol levels, cataract research), or population levels of biological organization. The results provide critical evidence supportive of wildlife’s resilience to the effects of chronic LD-LDR exposures, even in areas with sufficient radioactivity to force human evacuations.
