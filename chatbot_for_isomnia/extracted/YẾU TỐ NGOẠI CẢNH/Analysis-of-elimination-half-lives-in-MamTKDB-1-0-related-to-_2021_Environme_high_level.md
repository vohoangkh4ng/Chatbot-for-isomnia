# Title: Analysis of elimination half-lives in MamTKDB 1.0 related to bioaccumulation: Requirement of repeated administration and blood plasma values underrepresent tissues

## Summary: This article discusses the development of the mammalian toxicokinetic database (MamTKDB) 1.0, which includes data on 3927 elimination half-lives for 1407 xenobiotics across various species. The study highlights differences in elimination half-lives between humans and rats, particularly in the context of repeated versus single administration of substances. It emphasizes the importance of repeated administration studies for accurately assessing bioaccumulation potential, as well as the limitations of using blood plasma values to represent tissue elimination half-lives. The findings suggest that certain chemicals, particularly per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), may require different animal models for accurate toxicokinetic assessments.
