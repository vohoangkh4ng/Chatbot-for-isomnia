# Abstract

**Study Objectives:** Light is the main time cue for the human circadian system. Sleep and light are intrinsically linked; light exposure patterns can influence sleep patterns and sleep can influence light exposure patterns. However, metrics for quantifying light regularity are lacking, and the relationship between sleep and light regularity is underexplored. We developed new metrics for light regularity and demonstrated their utility in adolescents, across school term and vacation.

**Methods:** Daily sleep/wake and light patterns were measured using wrist actigraphy in 75 adolescents (54% male, 17.17 ± 0.83 years) over 2 weeks of school term and a subsequent 2-week vacation. The Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) and social jetlag were computed for each 2-week block. Light regularity was assessed using (1) variation in mean daily light timing (MLiT); (2) variation in daily photoperiod; and (3) the Light Regularity Index (LRI). Associations between SRI and each light regularity metric were examined, and within-individual changes in metrics were examined between school and vacation.

**Results:** Higher SRI was significantly associated with more regular LRI scores during both school and vacation. There were no significant associations of SRI with variation in MLiT or daily photoperiod. Compared to school term, all three light regularity metrics were less variable during the vacation.

**Conclusions:** Light regularity is a multidimensional construct, which until now has not been formally defined. Irregular sleep patterns are associated with lower LRI, indicating that irregular sleepers also have irregular light inputs to the circadian system, which likely contributes to circadian disruption.

**Key words:** light regularity; light variability; sleep regularity; adolescence; vacation; light timing ## Statement of Significance

Humans evolved under regular light/dark cycles, providing consistent daily time cues for the circadian system. Our modern control over light environments has subverted these natural time cues. However, there is no widely adopted method for calculating the regularity of light patterns. We propose three new light regularity metrics. Applying these metrics in adolescents, we found that individuals with more irregular sleep patterns tended to also have more irregular light patterns. We also found that light patterns were more regular during vacation compared to school term. These findings demonstrate that irregular sleep patterns are associated with less regular light/dark cycles, which may explain the association of irregular sleep patterns with a wide range of poor health and functional outcomes.

## Introduction

In humans, an extensive network of circadian clocks regulates daily rhythms in physiology and behavior, including sleep–wake regulation. These clocks are entrained by rhythmic signals from the environment, including light, meal times, and physical activity. Light, however, is the primary input for entrainment of the central circadian clock.

Humans evolved under highly regular light/dark cycles, with bright days and dark nights. Deviations from that ancient pattern contribute to circadian disruption. Key characteristics of light exposure patterns that have been causally related to circadian disruption include increased light exposure in the evening/night, and reduced light exposure in the morning/day. Currently, however, there remains no consensus on the best way to quantify multiday light recordings in a circadian context, making it difficult to compare findings between studies. Moreover, no measures have yet been widely adopted to measure light regularity—the consistency of light exposure patterns between days. This is despite an increasing number of wearable devices being designed to record light data, representing a substantial untapped potential in data being collected but with no standardized way of quantifying it.

Recent research has found that irregular sleep patterns are associated with a wide range of adverse health and functional outcomes. It has been proposed that these associations may be driven by circadian zeitgebers, including light. For example, in individuals with irregular sleep patterns, sleep can be viewed as a gate for light. Therefore, individuals with more irregular sleep would be anticipated to show greater variability in their light exposure patterns, resulting in less robust inputs to the circadian system and ultimately circadian disruption. It is also likely that the relationship between sleep and light is bidirectional, meaning irregular light exposure may also produce irregular sleep patterns via effects of light on the circadian clock.

To date, however, the relationship between sleep regularity and light regularity has not been formally explored. Animal research demonstrates that circadian disruption by irregular light timing increases the sensitivity of the circadian system to perturbations and has an adverse impact on mood and cardiometabolic health. Identifying a simple and easily implemented metric of light regularity could therefore advance our understanding of the real world impact of light exposure patterns on the circadian system and downstream health outcomes. We here propose three new metrics that capture different dimensions of variability in light exposure patterns across days. These metrics capture variation in the (1) timing and (2) duration of light exposure, as well as (3) the overall similarity of light patterns between consecutive days.

Adolescence is an ideal period to study the utility of the new metrics as adolescents naturalistically encounter variable sleep patterns due to a delay in preferred sleep timing and early school start times. During school terms, adolescents typically experience regular but restricted sleep during weekdays, followed by social jet lag during weekends; during vacation periods, they typically experience irregular but relatively unconstrained sleep.

## Methods

### Participants

Participants were 75 adolescents in the final 3 years of their secondary education (years 10, 11, and 12; 54% male, age M ± SD = 17.17 ± 0.83 years) in Melbourne, Australia. The dataset was originally collected to examine sleep and daily functioning (affect and cognition) in adolescents, and is used here for secondary analysis. Individuals were not eligible for the study if they: (1) were taking medications that may affect sleep (e.g. analgesics or melatonin); (2) did not attend the final 2 weeks of a school term; (3) traveled across time zones during the study; or (4) did not have access to a smartphone with an internet connection. To maximize generalizability, there were no exclusion criteria for sleep disorders. Participants were recruited through online advertisements, in-person recruitment, and posters in public spaces. Informed assent and consent were obtained from the participant and a parent or guardian, respectively.

### Design

Sleep/wake and light exposure patterns were monitored continuously using a wrist-worn actigraphy device for four consecutive weeks. Sleep timing was also self-reported each morning via a smartphone application (Metricwire Inc.). Data were collected from each participant over the last 2 weeks of a school term and the subsequent 2-week vacation. There were seven rounds of data collection between November 2017 to July 2019 with each participant completing one round of data collection. We found no significant differences in sleep regularity and total sleep time by round. Light regularity and average lux were significantly different across rounds of data collection, which is likely the result of seasonal variations in light. Study procedures were approved by Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee. Participants were reimbursed for their time.

### Sleep/wake timing
Sleep was measured via wrist actigraphy (Actiwatch 2, Actiwatch-Spectrum Plus and Actiwatch-Spectrum Pro, Philips Respironics) worn on the nondominant wrist. Data were collected in 1-min epochs. Sleep/wake intervals were detected using the “medium” threshold in Actiware 6.0.9. The medium threshold designates an epoch as either asleep or awake by determining whether a participant’s activity exceeds a specified threshold in 40 out of the 60 activity counts. Light data recorded by the device are not used to designate sleep/wake state. Sleep/wake times were then confirmed using a 13-item consensus sleep diary, administered daily via the smartphone application Metricwire.

### Light
Daily light exposure was measured in photopic illuminance in 1-min epochs via wrist actigraphy (Actiwatch 2, Actiwatch-Spectrum Plus and Actiwatch-Spectrum Pro; wavelength range 400–700 nm) and expressed using the unit lux. Participants were instructed to wear the device at all times on their nondominant wrist, except when it would get wet or damaged.

### Statistical analysis
A total of 205 participants completed the study, 35 participants did not have an actigraphy device capable of recording light data, leaving 170 participants with light data measured via wrist actigraphy. Raw light data were processed for sleeve coverage and non-wear by setting epochs with <1 lux during wake to missing. Days with more than 33% (8 h) of missing data were excluded from analysis to reduce bias (25.6% of days, n = 1239). During vacation, sleep was considered “restricted” if participants reported waking for a commitment such as work, or sport; these days were also excluded from analysis (3.43% of days, n = 50). If a participant had less than 16 days of valid light or sleep light data based on the above criteria, they were excluded from analysis. In total, 95 participants were removed by this criterion, leaving 75 participants available for the analyses. To confirm results were robust to this choice of cutoff, analyses were repeated using other cutoffs. Metrics for sleep regularity and light regularity were computed for each individual for the school and vacation periods separately. We found no significant differences in key demographics (e.g. age, sex, sleep regularity, and total sleep time) between those included and not included in the analyses. The frequency of self-reported sleep disorders in the analyzed sample was low (n = 3, 4%). Additional analyses were conducted which included and excluded these individuals from analysis, no significant differences were observed. These individuals were therefore included in the analysis.

### Sleep regularity
Daily and weekly dimensions of sleep regularity were assessed using the Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) and social jetlag, respectively. The SRI quantifies day-to-day changes in sleep/wake patterns by calculating the percentage probability of an individual being in the same state (i.e. awake or asleep), at any two time points, 24 h apart. Scores are scaled to range 0–100, with individuals who go to bed and wake up at the same time every day scoring 100, and individuals who sleep randomly throughout the day scoring 0. Participants whose SRI value was calculated using less than 5 days of overlapping valid epochs were considered missing for that period (school = 0%; vacation = 2%, n = 2).

Social jetlag quantifies weekly rather than daily changes in sleep timing. The metric describes the discrepancy between biological and social time that exists because of the conflict between chronotype-driven preference for sleep times, and the sleep times required to fulfill work/school obligations. Social jetlag has been operationalized as the absolute difference between midsleep time on free days (MSF) and midsleep time on workdays (MSW). MSF and MSW represent the midpoint between the sleep onset and offset on free days and workdays, respectively. For the purpose of this study, weekdays (Sunday to Thursday nights) were considered “workdays.”

### Light regularity
Daily variability in light exposure patterns was quantified using three approaches.

1. **Light timing variability**: Mean light timing (MLiT) calculates the average clock time of epochs in which an individual’s light exposure is above a specified threshold (e.g. 100 lux). Daily MLiT values were calculated for each participant, excluding days with fewer than 10 min above the threshold. The mean and SD were calculated for each participant, with the SD used as a measure of light timing variability. To understand the sensitivity of the metric to the choice of the threshold, calculations were repeated using thresholds of 10, 20, 50, 100, 300, and 500 lux. We note the importance of including relatively low thresholds, given there is evidence for sensitivity of the human circadian system to light levels <30 lux, and that adolescents may be especially sensitive to light.

2. **Photoperiod variability**: For each day, we calculated the interval of time between the first epoch that light levels rose above a specified threshold (e.g. 100 lux) and the last epoch that light levels fell below the same threshold.

![Figure 1. Representative light plot for one participant over a single day during the school period. Individual light data (lux) has been plotted by time of day (clock time in hours). MLiT for a threshold of 100 lux is marked by the blue square, which represents the average clock time of when light exposure is above 100 lux (dashed line), represented by the blue trace on the graph. For this example, MLiT occurs at 11:50. Photoperiod for a 100 lux threshold is represented by the red line. Photoperiod is calculated as the duration in hours between the first and last time light exposure crosses a specific lux threshold, within a waking day. For this example, photoperiod is 13.3 h.** total duration of epochs above the threshold, but rather the time between the first and last relevant exposure; this is inspired by the importance of skeleton photoperiods for the circadian clock. The mean and SD were calculated for each participant, with the SD used as a measure of photoperiod variability. We also examined variability within the timing of the Photoperiod by calculating the SD of both the start and end of the daily photoperiod within the school and vacation periods. These results were consistent with the variability observed among Photoperiod duration.

To understand the sensitivity of the metric to the choice of the threshold, calculations were repeated using thresholds of 10, 20, 50, 100, 300, and 500 lux.

### Light Regularity Index (LRI)
Inspired by the formulation of the SRI, we devised an equivalent metric for light. First, we converted the light time series into a binary signal (similar to sleep vs. wake), based on whether the light level was above or below an absolute threshold (i.e. 10, 20, 50, 100, 300, and 500 lux). The LRI was then calculated by determining the probability that an individual was in the same state (above vs. below a threshold) at any two time points, 24 h apart. The index was scaled so that an individual who records light exposure greater than the threshold light level at exactly the same times each day would score 100, whereas an individual who records random light exposure patterns would score 0. Participants whose LRI value was calculated using less than 5 days of overlapping valid epochs were considered missing for that period (school = 0.00%; vacation = 2.00%).

All three light regularity metrics showed greater regularity during vacation compared to school term. Photoperiod and MLiT variability decreased from school to vacation across most thresholds and were both statistically significant at the 10, 20, and 50 lux thresholds. The LRI also increased from school to vacation, across all thresholds and were statistically significant at the 50 and 100 lux thresholds indicating greater regularity in light patterns.

### The LRI was associated with multiple dimensions of sleep
During both the school term and vacation, SRI and LRI scores were significantly positively correlated at the 10, 20, and 50 lux thresholds, indicating that more regular sleep patterns were associated with more regular light patterns for this dimension of light regularity. MLiT and Photoperiod variability were not significantly associated with the SRI at any of the lux thresholds. Social jetlag was not significantly correlated with any light regularity metric.

Sleep duration was significantly positively correlated with LRI scores at the 10, 20, 50, and 100 lux levels during both the school and vacation period, while sleep timing was significantly negatively correlated with LRI scores at the 10, 20, and 50 lux levels during the school and vacation. These relationships were present during both the school and vacation periods, indicating that more regular light patterns were consistently associated with both longer sleep duration and earlier bedtimes. MLiT and Photoperiod had no consistent significant relationships with either sleep timing or duration.

### Results
The analyzed sample included 75 adolescents (41 males, 34 females), aged 15–18 years (M ± SD = 17.17 ± 0.83 years). During the vacation compared to the school term, on average, sleep duration was 39 min longer, midsleep time was 1.41 h later, and the SRI remained unchanged. Social jetlag decreased by 19 min during vacation compared to the school term, indicating a less pronounced weekday/weekend variation in sleep times during vacation. Sleep duration increased during vacation for 64 (85% of) students; of those, only 19 (25% of) students also showed an increase in sleep regularity. These two counteracting effects (less weekday–weekend variation and greater weekday-to-weekday variation) approximately canceled out for the circadian clock is a timing system that relies on regular environmental inputs to maintain robust rhythms, of which light is the chief input. While metrics have been widely adopted for

Increased SRI with more regular sleep patterns also experienced more regular light exposure patterns. Interestingly this was not reflected in the dimensions of photoperiod or MLiT. Compared to a relatively restricted sleep schedule (school term), a relatively unrestricted sleep schedule (vacation) was found to have more regular light patterns, whereas sleep regularity remained unchanged between school and vacation.

Irregular sleep patterns have previously been associated with dimmer daytime light exposure and brighter nighttime light exposure. We found here that irregular sleep patterns, quantified by SRI, are also associated with less regular light inputs to the circadian system. This association was significant for LRI, which is the metric most similar in its formulation to SRI. Notably, the relationship between SRI and LRI was consistent across the transition from school (restricted sleep) to vacation (unrestricted sleep), indicating that the relationship is not simply driven by restrictions on sleep timing. This important finding suggests that the correlation is likely to generalize to other populations who experience variable degrees of restrictions on sleep timing, such as shift workers. Furthermore, this association indicates that SRI may be a useful proxy for variability in light input to the circadian system, which provides a useful interpretation for large-scale cohort studies where actigraphy has been collected but light has not. The fact that SRI did not significantly associate with the other two light regularity metrics (photoperiod and MLiT) demonstrates that there are multiple dimensions to light regularity. The notion that these metrics can measure different aspects of the light stimulus is further supported by the fact that the Photoperiod, MLiT, and LRI variables failed to correlate with one another. Depending upon the outcomes of interest, the three measures of light regularity. | Metric                     | School M | School SD | Vacation M | Vacation SD | p     | 95% CI LL | 95% CI UL |

Irregular sleep patterns have been found to associate with a wide range of negative health and functional outcomes. However, we currently do not understand whether these associations are causal, and if so, which pathways are involved. One plausible pathway from irregular sleep to negative outcomes is via circadian disruption, given the circadian system regulates many aspects of physiology. When we are awake, we are typically exposed to light at levels that impact the circadian system Table 4.

Sleep can therefore be viewed as a gate for light, meaning that irregular sleep patterns would be expected to result in irregular light input to the circadian system, and subsequent circadian disruption. Indeed, we found such an association between SRI and LRI. This association is likely a bidirectional causal relationship: while sleep patterns can be viewed as a gate to light exposure, irregular light exposure could also lead to irregular sleep, due to less stability in circadian timing. To help understand this relationship a longitudinal assessment of sleep and light regularity would be useful.

Light is the key input to the human circadian system, and adolescents are thought to be especially sensitive to the effects of light. Evening light exposure and use of light-emitting devices are both associated with delayed sleep in adolescents. In homes that lack electric lighting, adolescents have earlier sleep onset times on school days. Increased light regularity would in theory result in more stable circadian entrainment, resulting in improved sleep quality due to improved circadian alignment of sleep. We found that adolescents with higher LRI also had longer and earlier sleep. This association is consistent with a prior study in adolescents, where sleep occurred earlier and lasted longer when previous daylight exposure was greater.

During vacation, we observed a reduction in the weekday vs. weekend mismatch in sleep timing that is typically evoked by early school start times. This was reflected in our dataset by the slight reduction in social jetlag during vacation compared to school, but no group level change in SRI. At the individual level, 68% of participants decreased in sleep regularity from school to vacation. We found that the majority of participants slept longer during vacation, consistent with previous studies, but only 25% of participants increased both their total sleep time and sleep regularity during the vacation. Extended sleep duration during vacation or rest days is often considered a marker of recovery from sleep loss accumulated during school term. Irregular timing of sleep could undermine the beneficial effects of sleep extension, since sleep quality is dependent on the circadian timing of sleep. This supports emerging evidence linking sleep regularity to various functional outcomes, including cognitive performance and psychological well-being. If the recovery potential of this 2-week period of unrestricted sleep is to be maximized, focus should also be placed on promoting decreased variability in adolescent sleeping behaviors. This means that future school-based programs that aim to improve adolescent sleep could place as much emphasis on sleep regularity as they do sleep duration.

We observed a consistent increase in light regularity from school to vacation across each of the three dimensions of light regularity. Adolescents experience restrictions on their sleep timing during the school term, while the vacation is associated with considerably more freedom. These restrictions could affect light exposure patterns; for example, due to differences in the types of daytime activities, wake times, or differences in the prebed routine such as use of electronic devices. Notably, the increase in light regularity we observed during vacation occurred despite no change in the average levels of light exposure, meaning the observed change could not simply be explained by a change in the number of hours of daylight exposure (e.g. due to changes in time spent outdoors). Further research is needed to better understand the behavioral basis for these changes.

Limitations of this study should be noted. Examinations or other events during the school monitoring period that may have influenced sleep were not recorded. There was, however, | Light Regularity Index | LRI10 | LRI20 | LRI50 |

no significant difference in sleep regularity or total sleep time between rounds of participation. The devices we used measured photopic illuminance at wrist level, so they may misestimate the circadian effects of light, which are primarily mediated by the retinal photoreceptor melanopsin. Additionally, sleep and light metrics were collected using the same device worn on the wrist, which could have inflated the relationship observed between sleep regularity and light regularity. Light data, however, are not used in the algorithm that calculates sleep intervals, nor is sleep used in the calculation of light regularity. We note that the light regularity metrics we proposed could be easily adapted to incorporate other measures of light exposure, such as melanopic illuminance. More sophisticated light measurement devices could be used in future to capture α-opic illuminances in this population and to identify specific types of light sources used.

In summary, there is a lack of standardized measures for assessing the impacts of light exposure on the circadian system in field settings. Measures of light regularity have been particularly neglected. The circadian system expects regularity, and light is its primary input. Here, we propose three promising ideas for the measurement of regularity in light exposure that are germane to the circadian system. These metrics have potential applications to other populations, particularly those that experience irregular sleep patterns such as shift workers. Social, and Psychological Influences.
