### Background
Growing evidence suggests that exposure to environmental chemicals, such as pesticides, impacts renal function and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it is not clear if pesticides may affect CKD progression and no studies exist in children.

### Objectives
The objective of this study was to examine associations between serially measured urinary OP pesticide metabolites and clinical and laboratory measures of kidney function over time among children with CKD.

### Methods
This study used data on 618 participants enrolled in the CKD in Children study (CKiD), a cohort study of pediatric CKD patients from the US and Canada. Children were followed over an average of 3.0 years (standard deviation (SD) = 1.6) between 2005 and 2015. In serially collected urine samples over time, six nonspecific dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of OP pesticides were measured. Biomarkers of tubular injury (kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)) and oxidant stress (8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and F2-isoprostane) were determined in the same specimens. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria, and blood pressure were assessed annually.

### Results
increase in∑diethyl metabolites was associated with increases of 11.9% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 4.8%, 19.4%) and 13.2% (95% CI: 9.3%, 17.2%) in KIM-1 and 8-OHdG over time, respectively. DAPs were associated with lower eGFR at baseline and higher eGFR over subsequent years.

### Conclusions
These findings provide preliminary evidence suggesting that urinary DAP metabolites are associated with subclinical kidney injury among children with CKD, which may signal the potential for clinical events to manifest in the future. The results from this study are significant from both a clinical and public health perspective, given that OP pesticide exposure is a modifiable risk factor.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious condition associated with significant comorbidities, mortality, and healthcare costs. Due to medical and technological advances, survival has improved, leading to greater prevalence, which is approximately 55–60 per million children in western nations. Although still relatively uncommon in children, CKD is associated with substantial morbidity, long-term health consequences, and healthcare costs, especially as it progresses to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). More research is needed on the determinants of CKD progression to ESKD and prevention strategies. Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors is a key goal.

Progression of CKD to ESKD occurs over time and factors such as blood pressure, hyperuricemia, and anemia have been shown to accelerate the rate of kidney function decline in children. Notably, few potentially modifiable risk factors have been identified in relation to CKD progression. However, there is growing evidence suggesting that non-traditional factors including exposure to environmental chemicals, such as pesticides, may affect renal function, which motivates the hypothesis that they could play a role in CKD progression as well.

Organophosphate (OP) and organochlorine pesticides have emerged as potential contributors to CKD of unknown etiology (CKDu), which is defined as unexplained CKD that occurs in the absence of typical risk factors or presentation such as diabetes and glomerular nephritis. Reports of farmworkers with occupational histories of pesticide application in Central America, India, and Sri Lanka motivated this hypothesis, but substantive evidence is still lacking. Epidemiologic studies conducted among farmworkers and their wives have also documented links between self-reported pesticide application and ESKD. Several studies have identified associations between serum biomarkers of pesticide exposure and CKDu and correlates of reduced kidney function in clinical populations in India. Results from toxicological studies have been consistent and indicate that this may occur through increased oxidant stress. For example, one OP, diazinon, enhances renal lipid peroxidation and diminishes antioxidant capacity. However, meta-analyses and reports from working groups have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support a contributing role of pesticides in CKDu, citing the need for more high-quality studies using biomonitoring for exposure assessment.

The general (i.e., non-occupational) population is exposed to OP pesticide residues primarily through diet. Exposure is prevalent, with at least 74% of children in the US having detectable levels of at least one dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolite, and children having significantly higher levels than adults. However, no studies have examined OP pesticide exposure in relation to renal function among children with CKD. Unlike other established risk factors for CKD progression, exposure to OP pesticides is potentially modifiable, given that studies have shown that exposure levels can be reduced by consuming organic foods.

Therefore, we conducted this study with the following objectives: (1) to examine the associations between serially measured urinary OP pesticide metabolites and clinical measures of kidney function (i.e., eGFR, proteinuria, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and time to ESKD or renal replacement therapy (RRT)) and laboratory measures of subclinical kidney damage (i.e., urinary biomarkers of tubular injury (kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)) over time in a well-characterized cohort of children and adolescents with CKD; and (2) to determine a potential mechanism of action by evaluating longitudinally assessed oxidative stress biomarkers (i.e., 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and F2-isoprostane.

# Material and methods

## Study population

The CKD in Children (CKiD) study is a multi-centered prospective cohort study of children aged 6 months to 16 years with mild-to-moderate CKD with the overall goal of identifying predictors and sequelae of CKD progression. The CKiD study procedures and protocol have been previously described. Briefly, pediatric patients with prevalent CKD were recruited at a network of sites in the US and Canada. Children were enrolled, assessed 3–6 months after study entry (i.e., baseline), and annually thereafter. These annual assessments included a physical examination, biospecimen collection (e.g., urine, serum, etc.), and questionnaire administration and were conducted until the initiation of RRT for treatment of ESKD. Biospecimens were stored in a central biorepository for future use in ancillary studies. The New York University (NYU) School of Medicine Institutional Review Board deemed this project exempt from review due to data collection being complete and the dataset de-identified.

## Exposure measures

Urine samples serially collected at annual visits were used for exposure assessment. Six DAP metabolites of OP pesticides, dimethylphosphate (DMP), diethylphosphate (DEP), dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP), diethylthiophosphate (DETP), dimethylphosphorodithidate (DMDTP), and diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP), and creatinine were analyzed at the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY. The target DAP metabolites were analyzed by solid phase extraction. Briefly, 0.5 mL of urine was transferred into a 15-mL polypropylene tube, and 2.5 ng each of isotope-labeled internal standard (IS) mixture (six ISs for each of the six target analytes) was added. The urine samples were mixed with 1.5 mL of 2% formic acid (v/v). The samples were then passed through Oasis WAX cartridges (50 mg/3 mL) that were conditioned with methanol (3 mL) and HPLC-grade water (3 mL). After loading samples, cartridges were washed with HPLC-grade water (3 mL) and acetonitrile/HPLC-grade water (3 mL; 50:50, v/v). Analytes were recovered by elution with 3 mL of 5% ammonia in methanol. The extracts were evaporated to near-dryness under nitrogen, fortified in 250 μL of acetonitrile/20 mM ammonium acetate (90:10, v/v), and filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon filter prior to instrumental analysis.

Chromatographic separation of the analytes was achieved with a Waters ACQUITY Class I HPLC system fitted with a Luna HILIC column. Injection volume was 1.5 μL, and mobile phase flow was 400 μL/min. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile (A) and 20 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile at pH 8.5 (B). The gradient started with 99% B and held for 6 min, linearly decreased to 50% within 0.1 min and held for 1.4 min, and reverted to initial condition within 0.1 min and held for 2.4 min. The total run time was 10 min. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems API 5500 electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The turbo ion spray source setting in the negative ionization mode were: curtain gas (CUR) 30 psi; collision gas (CAD) 10 psi; source temperature 550◦C; ion source gas 1 70 psi; ion source gas 2 70 psi; and ion spray voltage –3500 V. Nitrogen was used as CUR and CAD. For all exposures, measures below the limit of detection (LOD) were 2.3. Outcomes

2.3.1. Clinical renal function measures
Clinical measures of renal function included eGFR, urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR), SBP, and DBP, all measured at each annual visit. EGFR was calculated using the modified Schwartz (i.e., bedside) equation. Methods for determining UPCR, SBP, and DBP have been described previously. Laboratory analysis of total urinary protein was determined using an immunoturbidimetric assay at the central CKiD laboratory (University of Rochester). UPCR was then calculated as the ratio of the total urinary protein concentration to urinary creatinine concentration. SBP and DBP were measured in the right arm by auscultation using an aneroid sphygmomanometer three times at 30-second intervals. The mean BP was computed and standardized to z-scores according to the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Fourth Report. Time to ESKD/RRT was determined by the start date of dialysis or transplantation.

2.3.2. Laboratory measures of renal damage
Laboratory measures of subclinical renal damage included urinary tubular injury biomarkers: kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), representing damage to the proximal tubule and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), representing damage to the distal tubule. KIM-1 and NGAL were assayed in stored urine samples at the NYU High Throughput Biology Laboratory. They were quantified by solid phase sandwich ELISAs using the Quantikine Human KIM-1 Immunoassay and Quantikine Human Lipocalin-2 Immunoassay, respectively, according to manufacturer instructions. All analyses were conducted in duplicate. Intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) ranged from 3.6% to 3.7% for KIM-1 and 2.3%-3.9% for NGAL. Inter-assay CVs ranged from 0.7% to 4.3% for KIM-1 and 0.6%-4.8% for NGAL.

2.3.3. Oxidant stress biomarkers
8-OHdG and F2-isoprostane were measured in urine samples with sufficient volume at the NYU High Throughput Biology Laboratory (N = 2465 samples; N = 618 individuals and N = 1287 samples; N = 522 individuals, respectively) using previously described methods. Briefly, 8-OHdG was quantified by competitive ELISA using the OxiSelect™ Oxidative DNA Damage ELISA and F2-isoprostane by a competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay, the OxiSelect™ 8-iso-Prostaglandin F2α ELISA kit.

2.4. Statistical analysis
Distributions of DAP metabolites were examined by calculating percent detection, geometric means, and selected percentiles. For comparison, we examined urinary levels of DAP metabolites among National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) samples from 2011 to 2012 for individuals aged 6–19 years. In preparation for modeling, urinary concentrations of DAP metabolites were natural log-transformed due to their right skewed distributions to reduce the influence of measures at the upper tail. Outcomes of interest that were right skewed: UPCR, KIM-1, NGAL, 8-OHdG and F2-isoprostane, were natural-log transformed before multivariable analysis in order to approximate normal distributions. To estimate longitudinal associations between repeated measures of DAPs and renal function measures and oxidative stress biomarkers, linear mixed effects models (LMMs) were fit with random intercepts and a first-order autoregressive correlation structure to account for both the intra-individual correlation of measures over time and inter-individual variation. Separate models were fit for each exposure-outcome combination. Models were run for each individual DAP metabolite as well as each molar sum (i.e.,∑DM, ∑DE, and ∑DAP) and all outcomes of interest (i.e., eGFR, UPCR, SBP, DBP, KIM-1, NGAL, 8-OHdG, and F2-isoprostane). Models were fit with DAP metabolites expressed on the volume basis (ng/ml or nmol/L) and urinary creatinine was controlled for as a covariate. All models additionally adjusted for continuous time since the baseline visit, a quadratic term for time, and baseline covariates hypothesized to act as confounders and/or key predictors of the outcome(s) based on previous literature: sex, race/ethnicity, age, glomerular versus non-glomerular or CAKUT categorization, birthweight, premature birth, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use, BMI z-score, and SBP z-score (in models for all outcomes except blood pressure). In addition, to examine whether associations varied over time as CKD progressed, we fit all models with cross-product interaction terms between all DAP metabolites and follow-up time. If the interaction with time was significant, we reported time-specific associations. Lastly, in all models, the log-transformed exposure variables were standardized so that the estimates represented the average change in the outcome in response to a 1-standard deviation (SD) change in the log-transformed exposure, which facilitates the interpretation of associations across exposures. In the presentation of results in the text for outcomes that were natural log-transformed (i.e., UPCR, KIM-1, NGAL, 8-OHdG and F2-isoprostane), the β-coefficients were exponentiated so that they could be interpreted as the percent change in the outcome response to a 1-SD increase in the log-transformed exposure. We also fit extended Cox proportional hazards models, which accommodate time-varying exposures, to estimate associations between longitudinal DAP metabolites and time to RRT. Time at risk started at the baseline visit and continued until the initiation of RRT or censorship at the end of follow-up. Follow-up time for this analysis was available outside of the clinical study period due to linkages with medical records, with a median of 5.7 years (IQR: 3.4, 8.0). The proportional hazards assumption was checked for all covariates using visual inspection of log–log survival curves and testing of Schoenfeld residuals and covariate-by-time interaction terms. Finally, we conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we considered several parameterizations of exposure including cumulative averages, peak concentrations, and quartiles. We also examined the potential for non-linear relationships by using generalized additive mixed-effect models (GAMMs). Second, we evaluated associations between DAP metabolites and rates of change in renal outcomes using a two-step approach: (1) estimating the individual slope over time using the individual repeated outcome measures and (2) using this slope as the outcome in a model with urinary DAPs. Third, we examined whether the associations between DAP metabolites and the outcomes of interest varied by kidney function level by stratifying by eGFR categories at baseline. Separate models were run among those with eGFR levels ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (eGFR category G3a and higher) and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (eGFR category G3b and lower). Third, residential zip code was available on 80% of children. We examined the impact of controlling for zip-code level poverty measures (i.e., percent below the poverty line) using American Community Survey data in our analyses. Fourth, we examined the impact of using an alternate method for accounting for variation in urinary creatinine excretion: the covariate-adjusted standardization plus covariate. Table 1

In a longitudinal cohort of children with CKD, we found that higher levels of DAP metabolites were associated with increased urinary excretion of KIM-1 over time, suggesting subclinical kidney injury. However, although DAP metabolites were associated with lower eGFR at baseline, there was a trend of higher eGFR over follow-up and no association with UPCR, SBP, DBP, or time to RRT.

oxidative stress as the central mechanism by which OPs induce acute kidney injury. In addition, toxicologic studies among diazinon and chlorpyrifos-treated rats and mice have shown dose-dependent increases in reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in tissues and declines in renal antioxidant enzyme activity. Our findings of diethyl metabolites associated with increased 8-OHdG are particularly consistent with this given that diazinon and chlorpyrifos are two species that metabolize to diethyl metabolites. Finally, although we did not observe associations with lipid peroxidation (i.e., F2-isoprostane), this was likely due to the smaller sample size.

In addition, the documentation of elevated urinary KIM-1 but not NGAL in relation to OP exposure is consistent with what is known about the localization of these biomarkers along the nephron. While NGAL is primarily expressed in the distal tubule, KIM-1 is detected in the proximal convolute tubule. Because of greater bulk uptake of environmental chemicals by the proximal segments, this may account for the stronger association between OP exposure and urinary excretion of KIM-1 in the CKID cohort.

Despite an inconsistent association that varied over time with eGFR, our findings suggest no other associations with clinical renal outcomes, but evidence of subclinical renal damage as assessed by tubular injury and oxidant stress biomarkers. Although there was no association with time to RRT, proteinuria, or blood pressure, we did observe an inverted J-shaped association with eGFR that persisted across several parameterizations of exposure, stratifications by baseline eGFR and glomerular disease type, and control for area-level socioeconomic status. Based on studies showing associations between pesticide exposures and ESKD, we hypothesized that such an association with eGFR could be due to OP exposure-induced ESKD and thus discontinued follow-up in those who reached this endpoint in the CKiD study. In other words, if those vulnerable to OP exposure dropped out of the study over time due to ESKD/RRT, it may appear that DAPs were positively associated with renal function among the remaining participants in the study in the later years of follow-up. However, the lack of an association between DAPs and time to ESKD/RRT does not support this possibility. At present, we do not have a satisfactory explanation for the inverted J-shaped trajectory of eGFR changes over time and OP exposure.

Our findings of increased 8-OHdG, indicating oxidant-mediated DNA damage, are consistent with the hypothesis that OPs affect renal function through induction of oxidant stress. In vitro studies have identified kidney dysfunction is known to affect urinary solute excretion, and those with severe CKD have been shown to have reduced excretory capacity owing to impaired glomerular filtration.

and/or diminished tubular secretion. Therefore, urinary biomarker concentrations may be affected, especially in those with the most advanced CKD. Consistent with this theory is our observations of decreasing urinary DAP concentrations over the course of follow-up among CKiD children and lower urinary levels of DAPs among CKiD children compared with healthy children from NHANES. However, we note that these differences may also be due to variation in residential proximity to agriculture, diet, home and garden OP pesticide use, and Table 5

From a public health perspective, these findings are significant because in contrast to many CKD risks which are not amenable to modification, OP body burdens can be ameliorated through consumption of organic foods. Studies have shown that interventions that introduce organic in the place of conventional produce effectively and rapidly reduce pesticide and herbicide exposure, evidenced by lower and even non-detectable levels of urinary pesticides. Additional studies specifically among children are needed to explain these differences in chemical exposure levels. Despite these differences in exposure, in sensitivity analyses, we observed that associations between DAPs and renal outcomes did not vary by baseline renal function. This suggests that our observed associations were not artifacts of any potentially impaired excretion among those with the most reduced renal function. This study has potential implications for CKDu research. Despite the lack of consistent associations with clinical endpoints, we documented renal injury on the subclinical level that indicates tubular damage and thus the potential for clinically apparent changes with extended follow-up. Specifically, elevated KIM-1 and 8-OHdG have been linked with faster CKD decline to ESKD, incident albuminuria, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. This supports the hypothesis that subclinical injury over time may eventually manifest as CKDu in the absence of traditional risk factors for CKD like hypertension or obesity. While we note that this study was not comprised of patients with CKDu, and that CKD diagnosed in children differs from CKDu in that the causes are well understood (including congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), hereditary nephropathies, and chronic glomerulonephritis); in documenting an association between OP pesticide exposure and subclinical evidence of kidney injury, it still may be of practical relevance to that line of research. Furthermore, this is the first study on pesticides and CKD conducted among children, which lays the groundwork for further studies of whether the origins of CKDu may emerge in early life.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, in a cohort of children with CKD followed over time, urinary DAP metabolites were associated with increased KIM-1 and 8-OHdG concentrations over the course of follow-up, showing a trend of subclinical tubular injury and promotion of oxidant stress in the absence of consistent evidence for clinically apparent renal outcomes. The increased excretion of tubular injury biomarkers indicate the need for ongoing surveillance for an adverse effect of OP pesticides on CKD progression in pediatric patients. These findings provide preliminary evidence for urinary DAP metabolites, serving as non-specific biomarkers of OP pesticides, ubiquitous environmental chemicals, to impact subclinical kidney damage among children with CKD.
