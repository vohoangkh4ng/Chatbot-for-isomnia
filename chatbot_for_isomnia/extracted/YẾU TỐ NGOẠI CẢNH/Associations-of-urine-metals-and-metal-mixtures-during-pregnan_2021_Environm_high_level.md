# Title: Associations of urine metals and metal mixtures during pregnancy with cord serum vitamin D Levels: A prospective cohort study with repeated measurements of maternal urinary metal concentrations

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between maternal exposure to urine metals during pregnancy and the vitamin D status of newborns. A prospective cohort study involving 598 pregnant women was conducted, measuring urinary metal concentrations and cord blood vitamin D levels. The findings indicate that increased levels of vanadium, cobalt, and thallium in maternal urine are associated with decreased cord serum vitamin D levels and higher odds of vitamin D deficiency in newborns. The study also highlights potential synergistic effects between these metals on neonatal vitamin D status.
