Aqueous film-forming foam, used in firefighting, and biowastes, including biosolids, animal and poultry manures, and composts, provide a major source of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) input to soil. Large amounts of biowastes are added to soil as a source of nutrients and carbon. They also are added as soil amendments to improve soil health and crop productivity. Plant uptake of PFAS through soil application of biowastes is a pathway for animal and human exposure to PFAS. The complexity of PFAS mixtures, and their chemical and thermal stability, make remediation of PFAS in both solid and aqueous matrices challenging.

Remediation of PFAS in biowastes, as well as soils treated with these biowastes, can be achieved through preventing and decreasing the concentration of PFAS in biowaste sources (i.e., prevention through source control), mobilization of PFAS in contaminated soil and subsequent removal through leaching (i.e., soil washing) and plant uptake (i.e., phytoremediation), sorption of PFAS, thereby decreasing their mobility and bioavailability (i.e., immobilization), and complete removal through thermal and chemical oxidation (i.e., destruction). In this review, the distribution, bioavailability, and remediation of PFAS in soil receiving solid biowastes, which include biosolids, composts, and manure, are presented. # Introduction

Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of synthetic compounds which do not occur naturally in the environment but are introduced through human activities. Because these substances are resistant to heat, water, and oil exposure, they are used extensively in a wide range of applications including in fire-fighting foam, non-stick cookware, fast-food wrappers, water-repellent fabrics (e.g., carpets and clothing), medical equipment, and plastic and leather products. Aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF) used in firefighting, landfill leachate, sewage effluent, and solid bio-wastes, including biosolids (formerly called treated sewage sludge) and composts, are the major sources of PFAS in soil and surface- and groundwaters. Large volumes of biowastes (e.g., crop residues, biosolids, composts, and animal manures) are produced and applied to soil to improve soil health and productivity in different countries. For instance, Australia is one of the leading countries that has demonstrated the beneficial use of biosolids for land application. About 75% of the total biosolids produced in Australia are used in agriculture for soil improvement and crop productivity, while the rest is utilised for land application in mining or industrial settings. This practice also leads to PFAS input to soils, thereby reaching the food chain. Some of these biowastes are considered as diffuse sources of PFAS in soil and groundwater and the second significant sources of PFAS after AFFF. In 2017, the Australia New Zealand Biosolids Partnership (ANZBP) published a report on ‘Assessment of Emergent Contaminants in Biosolids,’ which indicated the presence of a range of PFAS including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (or perfluorooctanesulfonate) (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in biosolids produced in Australia. Similarly, the presence of PFAS in biosolids and composts have been reported in many other countries including the USA, and countries in Europe.

Due to their extremely recalcitrant nature, the concentrations of PFAS chemicals are expected to increase in biowaste-applied soils with frequent applications, similar to heavy-metal accumulation from applications of biosolids, or cadmium build-up due to phosphatic-fertiliser applications. Thus, PFAS derived from biowastes is likely to enter the food chain through plant uptake, thereby leading to potential risks to human and ecological health. The fact that PFAS have been detected in influents, effluents, and sludges from a number of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) worldwide suggests that WWTPs and sludges are key links for widespread diffuse contamination of PFAS in the environment. PFOA and PFOS concentrations ranging from < 0.5 to 1057.1 ng L^-1 and < 0.06 to 461.7 ng L^-1, respectively, have been reported in influents and effluents of several WWTPs across the world. Similarly, mean concentrations of 0.021 mg kg^-1 PFOS and 0.03 mg kg^-1 PFOA were recorded in biosolid samples collected as part of Australia New Zealand Biosolids Partnership report on ‘Assessment of Emergent Contaminants in Biosolids’. PFAS from PFAS-contaminated and biosolid-amended soils can enter earthworm and plant bodies posing a potential risk to the terrestrial food chain. It could be hypothesised that biogeochemical behaviour and fate of PFAS derived from biowastes in soil and groundwater would be different from those derived from AFFF. For example, it has been demonstrated that soil-derived organic-carbon normalized sorption coefficients were not accurate predictors of the release of long-chain PFAS inputs from biosolid application.

Ingestion of PFAS is considered as the major human exposure pathway, which includes the potable use of contaminated water, consuming contaminated land-based food and seafood, and food packaged in PFAS-containing materials. Ingestion of PFAS that are commonly present in a contaminated food or drink matrix can aggravate human health issues, including causing cancer and damaging reproductive and developmental systems.

PFAS are a large and complex manufactured chemical mixture in the environment, having high mobility in soil and water, and they are chemically, biologically, and thermally stable. Therefore, remediation of PFAS in both solid (i.e., soil and wastes) and aqueous (i.e., groundwater and storm water) media is challenging. For solid media such as soil and wastes, PFAS can be removed through abiotic and biotic degradation (bioremediation) or immobilized using adsorbents. Nevertheless, using a single bioremediation approach for PFAS under in situ conditions is challenging, and may not be successful because the process is very slow. Abiotic degradation, including chemical and thermal degradation processes to remove PFAS from solid media and biowastes prior to soil application, has potential. But such processes are costly and energy intensive.

There have been a number of reviews on PFAS contamination resulting mainly from AFFF. A few previous reviews highlighted PFAS contamination in water resources. However, no comprehensive review on PFAS derived from biowaste application to soil has been reported. The current review, therefore, focuses on the distribution, behaviour, and remediation of PFAS in solid biowastes, including biosolids, composts and manures, and in soils receiving these biowastes. After giving a brief account of the biowastes commonly used as soil amendments and the PFAS accumulation pattern in them, we discuss the contaminants’ physico-biochemical behaviours in the biowaste matrices and biowaste-amended soils and give a critical appraisal of remediation approaches of the contaminants. This is the first major review article dedicated solely to the PFAS issue in agriculturally important biowastes that are gaining increasing popularity in recent days for sustainable land management practices.

# Sources and soil application of biowastes

A wide range of commercially available organic amendments (biowastes), including animal manures, yard waste composts, crop residues, and biosolids, are used for improving soil quality. N. Bolan et al. Environment International 155 (2021) 106600

In view of the ever-growing energy demands and environmental impacts of inorganic fertilizers, extensive application of biowastes as a nutrient source will become more popular in future agricultural production. The advantages and limitations of major biowastes, such as animal manures, composts, plant residues, and biosolids, are discussed in this section.

## 2.1. Forms and values of biowastes

With the growing human consumption of livestock and poultry products, a tremendous amount of animal manures (SI Table 1), including urine and flushing materials from confined poultry and animal industries, requires environmentally benign disposal. The enrichment of trace elements (e.g., Cu and Zn) derived from animal diets endows great nutritional potential of these organic wastes for promoting the plant growth. Land disposal of animal manures, which is related to weather conditions, must comply with the legally prescribed maximum content of organic-N in the manures to prevent aquatic eutrophication due to infiltration and surface runoff. Typically, before land application, animal manures should be processed via composting, anaerobic digestion, granulation, and alum treatment.

Composting is a controlled process to stabilize organic wastes (e.g., crop residues, organic residues, and animal manures) for recycling and disposal via aerobic biological decomposition. Compost improves the stability of soil aggregates, lowers the soil bulk density, reduces the chance of soil erosion, increases the soil porosity and water holding capacity, and provides soil nutrients (e.g., C and N). Household biowastes (e.g., yard waste) may contain slowly decomposable materials (e.g., plastic debris), while sewage sludge and animal manures can be contaminated by various chemical compounds. Thus, the quality of the final composting products should be rigorously monitored and controlled before field applications.

Sustainable management of plant residues (e.g., stalks, stems, leaves, and seed pods), which contain a significant amount of plant nutrients, is vital in environmental protection practices. When applied as soil amendments, plant residues can provide important nutrients for subsequent crop uptake, thus enhancing agricultural productivity. Among the plant residues commonly used as amendments of agricultural soil are rice straw and corn straw, and they potentially can be used for humus production. Straw application to farmland has been reported to increase water holding ability, bulk density, aggregation, pesticide retention, and microbial biomass and activity of the amended soil, as well as the water use efficiency of plants.

With the ever-increasing number of high-volume WWTPs, a tremendous amount of biosolids are produced globally (SI Table 1). Typically, the organic matter and organic carbon account for 40–70% and 20–50% of biosolids, respectively. Biosolids contain a high level of plant nutrients such as N (~3.2%), P (~2.3%), and K (~0.3%). Biosolids can increase the soil organic matter, macro- and micro-nutrients (e.g., N, P, K, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu), air and water permeability, aggregate stability, porosity, water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, and microbial activity of agricultural soils, which subsequently enhance the soil fertility and crop yield and inhibit soil erosion.

## 2.2. Limitations of soil-applied biowastes

In addition to the above biowastes, food waste composts, papermill and pulp sludges, and anaerobic digestates have been used as soil amendments. Nevertheless, high concentrations of potentially toxic elements (e.g., Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Co, As, and Pb), contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), disinfectants, detergents, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and steroid hormones), and pathogenic microorganisms in the biowastes have limited their land application potential because of plausible contaminant issues. If not managed properly, biowastes might also cause nutrient imbalances in the amended soil, surface water contamination with excess nutrients, and increased greenhouse gas emission. Several biowastes, therefore, require appropriate pre-processing or pre-treatment (e.g., alkaline stabilization of biosolids and anaerobic digestion) before they can be applied to farmland soils.

Recently, there has been increasing concern over the presence of PFAS, which are environmentally persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic to animals and humans, in commercially available biowastes owing to their ubiquitous usage in myriads of industrial, agricultural, and household products. PFAS have been recently identified in organic composts, biosolids, and plants. For example, high levels of PFASs were detected in vegetables, wheat grains, and maize grains grown near the fluorochemical industrial parks. A recent survey of the nine Canadian sludge treatment systems reported that PFDA was frequently detected in over 85% of the biosolids samples. The above biowastes are considered as organic materials for composting process and it is likely that the composting products contain PFAS. Researchers have shown that PFAS were found in different commercial compost products. In most cases, the conventional pre-treatments of biowastes have been found inefficient to remove PFAS, because of the extremely persistent nature of the contaminants. Finding an effective pre-treatment method to immobilize PFAS, and simultaneously tackle common issues associated with biowastes, is needed in order to promote sustainable use of biowastes for soil application.

## 3. Distribution and accumulation of PFAS in biowastes and biowaste-treated soil

### 3.1. Wastewater effluents and sludge (biosolids)

In the past, investigations on PFAS risk assessment and remediation mostly focused on concentrated point source contamination. However, diffused PFAS contamination via landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, and biosolids should not be overlooked. It is important to note that while treated wastewater is considered as a point source of pollutant input, biosolid application can be considered as a diffuse or non-point source of pollutant input. For example, household wastewater containing PFAS (e.g., from non-stick coatings on cookware) in low concentration can reach WWTPs and tend to accumulate in biosolids. The concentrations of PFAS within biosolids are dependent on the nature of the treatment processes from where PFAS are released. Treatment of sludge is necessary to produce commercial biosolid-based products to meet the EPA Part 503 Biosolids regulations. Among four commercially available types of biosolids (heat treated, composted, blended, and thermally hydrolysed), only the Table 1

biosolids blended with materials containing no PFAS reduced perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) concentration in the treated product due to a dilution effect Heating and composting treatments increased PFAA concentration in the products owing to the breakdown of PFAA precursors during the treatment processes In addition, part of the PFAA precursors remained in biosolids after the treatments which can become a source of PFAA after application of biosolid-based products The authors suggested that common post-treatments were ineffective in reducing PFAS contents in biosolid-based products Therefore, controlling sources potentially contributing PFAS loads into wastewater treatment plants could be a better alternative

PFAS can reach the sewage system in WWTPs through a number of industrial sources, including PFAS, fluoropolymer and AFFF manufacturing facilities The PFAS issue arises in sewage sludge because conventional WWTP systems are not efficient in the removal of the PFAS recalcitrant compounds during the treatment PFAS have been found in influents N.

PFOS ranging in concentrations from 15 to 600 ng g 1. Kallenborn samples to investigate PFAS release from 19 Australian WWTPs. The average concentration of PFAS in liquid and solid samples was 110 ng L 1 and 34 ng g 1, respectively. The concentration of PFCA was higher in the discharged effluents than influents, and their sorption on the solid matrix within WWTPs increased with increasing chain length of fluoroalkyl from 0.05 to 1.22 log units. PFCA, such as perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), were increased in the discharged effluent compared to the influent. A PFSA of 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (FTS), which was an intermediate degradant from C6 based precursors, was found as the key chemical that enhanced the release of PFAS from Australian WWTPs.

Gallen et al. (2018) reported the emission of PFAS through effluents, influents, and biosolids of 14 different WWTPs in Australia (Table 1). The PFOS and PFOA concentrations in the biosolid treated soil were as high as 408 ng g 1 and 312 ng g 1, respectively. Sludge from the WWTP contained PFOA concentrations up to 1875 ng g 1. The application of biosolids from the WWTP was discontinued from 2007, and since then the concentration of PFAS in the sludge-applied surface soils decreased remarkably. The decrease was attributed to leaching loss to deeper soil over time. PFAS could be taken up by plants and farm animals from biosolid-applied agricultural soils suggesting a potential pathway to enter human bodies though dietary exposure.

In addition to the direct sources of PFAS into WWTPs, a number of PFAS precursors could indirectly contribute to the final concentration of PFAS in the effluent and biosolids. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) listed 875 chemicals with the potential to produce PFAA through incomplete degradation of former chemicals. For PFOS, the precursors include derivatives and polymers of perfluoroalkyl sulfonyl or sulfonamide compounds. The PFOA precursors could have high diversity, including derivatives and polymers of perfluoroalkyl alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, esters, ethers, and iodides. WWTPs could show a 9 to 352% increase in PFOA concentration in effluents compared to influents. However, PFOS concentrations in sewage effluents is generally less than that of sewage influents owing to the retention of PFOS in the sludge. Becker et al. (2008) reported a 20-fold increase in PFOA concentrations from sewage influents compared to those in sewage effluents. In addition, 10% PFOA and 50% PFOS from the sewage influents were retained in the sludge solids.

sewage sludge to 100 μg kg 1 dry weight. The authors analysed a total of 201 sewage sludge and 45 biowaste samples and found concentrations of PFOS and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) in sewage sludge and compost of 698 and 29 μg kg 1 dry weight, respectively. Sewage sludge contained more short-chain PFAS (85.9%) and fewer long-chained compounds (14.1%), whereas composts followed an opposite trend of containing 53.2% long-chained and 46.8% short-chain compounds. The higher level of short-chain PFAS in sewage sludge could be attributed to the preferential partition of short-chain PFAS in sludge during wastewater treatment process, whereas the slightly higher level of long-chain PFAS in composts could be attributed to the leaching loss of short-chain PFAS during the composing process.

Similarly, Brändli et al. evaluated composts and digestates from 39 commercial composting and digestion plants in Switzerland in order to measure the loads of PFAS in these materials. The composts and digestates were being applied to agricultural soils as recycled fertilizers to improve the physicochemical conditions and health of soils. The total PFAS load in the compost and digestate samples was 6.3 μg kg 1 dry weight, and this value was compared with levels in sludge and sediment samples that had concentrations varying from 3.4 to 35.2 μg kg 1. The concentration of PFOS in hospital sewage sludge was low (539.6 pg g 1) in Nigeria, and it possibly originated from medical equipment. A continuous monitoring for PFAS release from industrial and societal activities is needed not only in biowastes in developed countries but also in developing nations.

3.2. Composts
Municipal solid waste composts are nutrient-rich soil amendments and reduce the load of waste released into the environment. But they might carry toxic substances, including PFAS, when applied to the land. PFAS have been used in many compostable food-packaging products, because of their non-sticky and waterproof properties. The PFAS found in food contact materials include PFSA, PFCA, fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOH), polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAP/di-PAP), FTS, and polyfluorinated ethers (PFE). The content and variety of PFAS in food-contact materials depend on the type of packaging materials (e.g., greasy food) and food-production sources.

In contaminated vegetated soils, root vegetables could be vulnerable for increased PFAS uptake through the chemicals’ direct contact with edible plant parts, and this warrants future studies under diverse soil types. Recently, a comprehensive review by Wang et al. reported the uptake of PFAS by field crops and vegetables. Many factors, including environmental conditions, the physicochemical nature of the PFAS, and plant-physiological responses, could influence the rate and extent of PFAS accumulation and distribution in plants.

### 3.3. Manures

As discussed earlier, several soil organic amendments can introduce PFAS into soils. For example, the application of sludge and biowastes to soils increases the loads of PFAS in the plant-growth media, which increases the possibility of PFAS transport and accumulation in plant parts including stalks, leaves, and grains. In addition, food composts generated from households might carry a significant amount of PFAS to soils. When these plant parts and food materials (grains, stalks, straws, packaged food) are consumed by pets, farm animals, and humans, a substantial amount of PFAS could accumulate in animal and human excreta, which subsequently are used as manures and again the PFAS are transferred to soils. Monitoring of PFAS in animal excreta and manures is, thus, important to understand the exposure and toxicity of PFAS to humans and animals. Until now, though only few studies have covered this aspect of research, there is enough evidence about the accumulation of PFAS in pets and livestock. In the USA, Ma et al. measured 15 PFAS in cat and dog faeces from the area around Albany, New York. Except for a few samples, almost all the PFAS were detected in the faeces samples. The PFAS concentration varied from 21.6 to 474 ng g⁻¹ dry weight for dog faeces, which was higher than cat faeces, which had concentrations of 18.0–165 ng g⁻¹ dry weight. Long-chained PFCA were dominant in all the pet faeces; some PFAS precursors were found at low concentrations. Cui et al. studied the excretion of PFOA and PFOS from rats during consecutive exposures to PFAS in diets. After 24 h, the release of PFOA through faeces and urine was 24.7–29.6% of the oral dose (5 and 20 mg kg⁻¹ body weight day⁻¹), whereas the PFOS release was just 2.6–2.8% of the same oral dose. The accumulation of PFOA was smaller than PFOS in the rat body, but both compounds showed considerable release into the environment via rat excreta. Farm animals also can potentially be exposed to PFAS through dietary pathways or grazing on contaminated land. Biosolids are known sources of PFAS contamination to soils, and they are often utilized for growing pasture and fodder crops, allowing the contaminants to enter the animal body through their feeds. The dominant intake route of PFAA into dairy-cow bodies could be through the consumption of silage grown in PFAS contaminated soils. By providing a single 8 mg kg⁻¹ body weight PFOS dose orally to beef cattle, Lupton et al. identified the major excretion route of the contaminants, which was through faeces (11% of the dose), and a substantial PFAS concentration persisted and accumulated in the cattle tissues. Therefore, PFAS load and release from manures, especially originating from farm animal excreta, warrant future research to eliminate PFAS bioaccumulation in crops, humans, and animals.

### 4. Behaviour and bioavailability of PFAS in biowastes and biowaste-treated soil

#### 4.1. Behaviour of PFAS in biowastes and biowaste-treated soil

Behaviour of per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances (or per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) in the environment is governed by the length of the alkyl chain and functional groups. Furthermore, it affects the availability of PFAS in soils, wastes, or surface waters along with physicochemical properties of PFAS and total organic content. It is difficult to identify the specific soil properties that are responsible for the sorption of PFAS to soils because of the complexity of the sorption process. However, a major role has been played by hydrophobic interactions between PFAS and soil organic carbon, electrostatic interactions between soil organics, minerals, and functional groups of PFAS, and divalent cation binding to ligands. Factors, such as clay content, organic carbon content, and pH of the soil, also affect the sorption of a few PFAS. Though soil organic matter plays a key role in the sorption of PFAS, other factors such as salinity and soil texture are also important in the sorption process. It has been hypothesized that ionic strength from high mineral content in the soil affects sorption. High cation content in soil decreases the sorption of PFAS. For example, a soil with sugarcane had a high cation content (130 g kg⁻¹) and it exhibited the lowest concentration of PFAS in soil.

#### 4.2. Bioavailability of PFAS in biowastes and biowaste-treated soil

Release of PFAS from biowastes, including biosolids and composts, may induce high bioavailability and bioaccumulation of PFAS in soil organisms and plants. The literature confirms the bioavailability of PFAS in soils (Table 2), and the adverse effects on living beings by accumulation of PFAS. Therefore, bioaccumulation of PFAS can be found in plants and animals, and their influence in food chain is shown in Table 3.

Higher sorption capacities to soils and sediments have been exhibited by long-chain PFAS [CnF₂n+₁COOH (n ≥ 7), and CnF₂n+₁SO₃H (n ≥ 6)] rather than short-chain PFAS, which determines the bioavailability. Studies have shown that high organic carbon content and alkyl chain length increase the sorption of PFAS, whereas high pH reduces sorption, thereby impacting bioavailability of PFAS. A few studies have investigated the bioavailability of PFAS in biowaste-applied soils, while most studies have focused on bioavailability of PFAS in soils. Bräunig et al. studied the bioavailability of PFAS in three soil types collected from two different airport sites and explored the bioaccumulation in earthworms, phytoavailability in grass, and bioavailability in leachate for a range of PFAS types. PFOS had the highest concentration in soils, leachate, wheat plants, and earthworms for both airport firefighting training grounds, as well as waste soils. A similar study was conducted by Hale et al. at an airport firefighting training ground in Norway. They reported a reduction of leaching of the dominant PFAS compound, PFOS by 94–99.9% for activated carbon, 29–34% for compost, and 28–40% for the activated carbon, compost and montmorillonite amended soil samples, respectively. Field soil samples collected from areas near potential PFAS contamination sources including industrial complexes and WWTPs have found to be exhibited a direct contamination of PFAS in minute concentrations. Despite direct contamination, another possible pathway of PFAS contamination is via soil amendments such as biosolids. Wen et al. studied PFAS contamination through biosolids in seven soil samples taken from the same site and their effects on earthworms. In alkaline soils, high concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were detected in biosolids-amended agricultural fields in Changping, China, which had different soil organic matter contents (1.38 to 3.9%). A correlation was obtained between the bioavailability of PFOS and PFOA and the organic matter content, which also increased with the application of biosolids. Furthermore, PFOS was identified as the most abundant PFAS in biosolid and biosolid-amended soil samples. The authors detected trace levels of PFAS in soil cores. Table 2

(at a depth of 120 cm) indicating vertical movement of PFAS, especially short-chain PFAS, in the soil profile over time
In different areas, such as the United States and Asia, soils from biosolids-applied agricultural fields have been investigated for the bioavailability of PFC. A high concentration of bioavailable PFAS (~5 μg g 1) was identified in biosolids-applied fields in Alabama in the USA. Over time, the concentration of PFAS decreased in the top layers of soil, due to leaching into deep soils. However, the estimated half-life of PFAS ranged from 1 to 3 years based on chain length, and, therefore, PFAS remain in the surface and deep soils for long periods of time.
Blaine et al. conducted PFAA bioaccumulation studies in biosolids-treated industrial soils involving both greenhouse and field-scale plant growth experiments. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and tomato [Lycopersicon lycopersicum (L.) H. Karst.] were chosen for the study. The uptake and accumulation of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and PFPeA were high in lettuce and relatively less in tomato. The authors found that bioaccumulation factors of lettuce for PFAA decreased with increasing number of CF2 group of the compounds (approx. 0.3 log units per CF2 group). In another greenhouse and field study, Lee et al. detected significant concentrations of PFAS such as PFCA in WWTP biosolids, print paper sludge, and compost. This study also reported that the uptake of PFCA by plants was more favourable for the short-chain congeners, such as PFBA, PFPeA, and PFHxA, and the transformation of PFCA compounds was confirmed by the presence of its metabolites. In a wheat crop (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in a soil treated with biosolids at various levels, nine PFCA and three PFSA were measured in roots, straw, husk, and grain. Total concentrations of PFAA in soil and different parts of the wheat plants increased with increasing application levels of biosolids. Similarly, Navarro et al. found PFAA in anaerobically digested, thermal-dried sludge and municipal solid waste compost. Tomato plants grown in soils treated with anaerobically digested, thermal-dried sludge accumulated high concentrations of PFBA and PFPeA.
To date, only limited studies have been published concerning the bioavailability of PFAS in biowaste-treated soils. Nevertheless, there is evidence about bioaccumulation and phytoavailability of PFAS from biosolids, as well as the bioavailability of PFAS in soils. Given PFAS can accumulate at each step of the food chain, there is a possibility that biowaste-treated soils pose adverse risks on living beings. Bioaccumulation of PFAS can lead to environmental toxicity, as shown in Table 4. PFOA and PFOS have been reported as phytotoxic compounds and also germination and seedling growth suppressants in wheat plant systems. Further, PFAS compounds have adversely affected microorganism such as green algae inhibiting their growth. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies have confirmed immunosuppressive, reproductive, neurological and endocrine disruptive toxicity of PFAS in animals. Direct ingestion of PFAS through food, water and hand-to-mouth transmittance are potential pathways of PFAS exposure in human beings. Nevertheless, research on toxicological effects of PFAS on human beings are limited. Scientists suspect for potential relationship between PFAS and health defects such as immune suppression, cancer and obesity of children.

through decreasing the concentration of PFAS in biowaste sources (i.e., source control). Mobilizing amendments including surfactants and desorbing agents, can be applied to increase the bioavailability and mobility of PFAS in biowastes and in soil treated with these biowastes. The mobilized PFAS can, subsequently, be removed through phytoremediation, soil washing, or destruction. Immobilizing amendments, such as sorbent materials, can be used to decrease the bioavailability and mobility of PFAS, thereby minimising their uptake by plants and leaching to groundwater. In the case of mobilizing techniques, there is a potential for leaching of the mobilized PFAS in the absence of active plant growth for PFAS uptake. But, in the case of immobilization techniques, there is a need for regular Table 4

### Source control

Efforts to control PFAS exposure must rely on reducing the use of PFAS-containing products, which range from household to industrial scale. However, the reduction in exposure is not straightforward and requires the combined efforts from a wide range of sectors, including policymakers and regulatory authorities. Soil and water serve as the natural sinks for the majority of the wastes and, hence, focusing on the sources of PFAS is a beneficial approach. Once PFAS enter soil or wastewater streams, biosolids, composts, or manures will not be free from PFAS contamination. Advanced technologies with high-end results, such as chemical oxidation and electron beams, could be applied to degrade PFAS in biowastes into harmless products, which would ensure their safe application to soil and, subsequently, they would have minimal effect on environmental and human health.

One approach to minimise the risk from PFAS contamination in biowaste-treated soils could be to modify the biowaste in such a way that the PFAS are either decomposed or eliminated before soil application. This type of source control of PFAS still poses several challenges, because the PFAS need to be completely changed into harmless chemical species and removed. Pre- and post-treatment of commercially sourced biosolids, using technologies such as heat treatment, composting, blending, or thermal hydrolysis, barely had any effect on reducing the level of PFAA. A detailed analysis confirmed that the high-temperature heat treatment increased the PFAA load. Thermal hydrolysis did not affect the PFAA load, while blending of the biosolids with maple sawdust and aged bark tended to dilute the concentration of PFAAs.

PFAA, which led to a reduced content in the biosolids (Fig. 5). The source reduction could serve as a preventive strategy to control the PFAS contamination at early stages which implies that there is relatively lesser probability of the commination. Since the source reduction is a significant aspect of lowering the PFAS contamination, it could be classified under the remediation measures.
Heating biowastes containing PFAS at high temperatures to alter the chemistry of the C-F bond could be a viable approach for addressing PFAS contamination. However, the evolution of potentially toxic volatiles at elevated temperatures could pose a more serious environmental concern than the PFAS themselves. One study highlighted that the addition of a liming agent, such as Ca(OH)2, to the PFOS-spiked sludge sample caused the C-F bond to break, which resulted in the formation of either CaF2 or Ca5(PO43F, depending upon the conditions employed) during the heating process. The formation of CaF2 is favoured at a low temperature of 400◦C, while Ca5(PO4)3 dominates at a high temperature of 900◦C, and the transformation ratio of fluorine to these two compounds is dependent on the Ca/F molar ratio used (Fig. 6). The various pathways for the mineralisation of fluorine into calcium salts during high-temperature treatment are shown in Figure SI 1.
Another point that needs to be considered is the cost. Because biowastes are cheap and readily available for use in huge quantities, their treatment before addition to the soil would incur a high cost, which will vary depending on the type of treatment used. Another concern is the addition of the PFAS-contaminated biowaste to soil. It presents an additional challenge, because it can be leached into groundwater and pose a more serious concern. More environmentally friendly approaches, such as the use of the renewable and biodegradable products for household and industrial purposes and advanced treatment technologies for PFAS remediation, are required to address this problem.

## Soil flushing and washing
The in situ removal of PFAS is much cheaper and easier to implement as compared to ex-situ adsorptive removal using carbon-based materials or other types. Soil flushing is an in situ method of remediating pollutants, wherein an influx of fluid containing desired additives is forced through the soil to dissolve and separate the contaminants. The type of soil and the nature of the extracting fluid are critical for maximising the removal of the contaminants, and soils with coarse texture and loosely bonded contaminants present good conditions for effective soil flushing. As it is a cyclic process, the extracted fluid containing the contaminants needs to be purified and fed back into the system for continuous removal. Because the need for excavation and transport costs are eliminated, soil flushing is an attractive proposition. PFAS are a complicated class of organic contaminants, and soils contaminated with them usually encompass a large area or a large field, such as airports and defence sites. Hence, soil flushing is expected to be a good option, wherein the extracting fluid in the form of organic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, or propanol, could be inserted into the ground at a specified place for the remediation of soil. However, the complexity of the PFAS and their existence in several chemical forms pose challenges, because the same extracting fluid might not be suitable for all the range of PFAS. Moreover, the flushed/extracted PFASs need to be dealt with by using appropriate measures such as degradation or complete destruction to achieve their remediation and prevent any further contamination.
Soil washing is another cost-effective technique that could be utilized to remediate soils containing PFAS. However, in comparison with soil flushing, the bulk soil needs to be brought onto a specific site and treated with an extracting fluid in an ex-situ type of process. The removal efficiency of various PFAS depends upon their solubility in the extracting fluid, and the most common PFAS, such as PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS, show good solubility in water. Hence, these can be easily removed from soil using water washing. Once removed with water, the PFAS are treated with an aqueous phase for further treatment with adsorbents such as activated carbon. This latter operation is expected to have a significant impact on increasing the overall cost for the removal of PFAS using a soil washing process. It needs to be mentioned here that one of the crucial parameters that will determine the efficacy of soil flushing and washing is the removal rate of the PFAS, which is dependent upon the characteristics such as the amount and flow conditions of the fluid employed for extraction. Overall, soil flushing and soil washing are promising technologies for PFAS removal, with each having its pros and cons in terms of process complexity, type of soils treated, and the cost involved.

The transformation ratio (TR) values for the sludge + PFOS + Ca(OH)2 samples (Ca/F molar ratio of 2:1) were obtained by heating samples at 400 ◦C, 600 ◦C, and 900 ◦C with different retention times. ## 5.3. Phytoremediation

Uptake, accumulation, and metabolism of PFAS in plant species present a potential risk of exposure to humans causing harmful effects. Nevertheless, plant uptake of PFAS offers the benefit of using this mechanism as a tool to remediate PFAS-contaminated soils. Plants can readily accumulate short-chain PFAS in their leaves, whereas the roots adsorb more of the long-chain compounds. Most of the literature focussing on plant uptake and accumulation of PFAS from bio-waste-amended soils deals with food crops, which are not suitable to use in phytoremediation of PFAS. Plant species that have been used for remediating other persistent organic pollutants (e.g., petroleum hydrocarbons, PCBs, pesticides) and other emerging contaminants (e.g., pharmaceuticals) could be tried for phytoremediation of PFAS.

However, plant species that can remediate other organic compounds cannot perform in a similar manner with PFAS, because these compounds have very different behaviours in the soil–water-plant ecosystem. PFAS are recalcitrant compounds, having unique chemical structures, and they are expected to be less degradable or non-degradable. Hence, extrapolation of previous results with other compounds is not appropriate in the study of phytoremediation of PFAS. Therefore, in-depth investigations are required concerning remediation of PFAS by plant species. Field studies with non-food crops are more relevant, to investigate the ability of plants to remediate PFAS present in bio-waste treated soils. Careful strategies need to be considered when disposing plant parts following phytoremediation of PFAS. Simple landfilling or unplanned disposal of the plant parts might pose a risk of returning the PFAS back into the environment. A recycling pathway of the PFAS-containing plant parts could be to convert them into biochar via high temperature pyrolysis, which is likely to eliminate PFAS through thermal degradation, and, at the same time, give a value-added product. Studies should also focus on the transformation or degradation of PFAS inside plants, about which no information is currently available. Most previous studies have investigated PFAS in plants grown near a specific point source, such as industrial manufacturing sites, fire training fields, landfills, or WWTPs. Field studies related to soil–plant relationships of PFAS in agricultural soils with biosolids are scarce, and the topic warrants future research.

## 5.4. Immobilization

Immobilization techniques help to reduce leaching of PFAS from soils into groundwater. A wide range of sorbent materials, such as activated carbon (powder or granular form), resins, minerals, bio-materials including biochar, polymers, amine functionalised materials, and modified clays, has been developed and tested for PFAS removal. Immobilization has been tested under many conditions, including laboratory-scale and field-scale trials, and the technique has been tried under both ex-situ and in situ conditions. The method has the potential of being a significant solution for PFAS contamination. Still, it is not a cost-effective remediation technique, because a large quantity of absorbents may be required. For example, adsorbents added at a rate of 10% (w/w) to immobilize PFOS can cause a significant increase in the cost of remediation. In addition to the high cost, the immobilization technique affects soil characteristics such as texture, thus limiting the final land use. In soils with added clay-based sorbents, the permeability and shear strength were changed. A study carried out at an airport firefighting training ground in Norway showed a reduction of PFOS of 94–99% using montmorillonite as an amendment. Observations indicated a change in the compressive strength of soil when it was mixed with powdered activated carbon (PAC) and RemBind® for immobilization of contaminants. Immobilization often cannot be the best option because contaminants will not be degraded or destroyed completely, but rather bind or immobilize them. The sorbed contaminants will be left in place; however, they can be desorbed over time which makes the treated soil a potential source of toxicity. This desorption could cause leaching of the contaminants to subsurface soils and groundwater. Results from the study demonstrate the application of biochar as a sustainable and environmentally-friendly sorbent for PFAS and metals in contaminated soils. In their study, PFAS-contaminated soils with varying total organic matter contents (1.6 and 34.2%) were amended with six doses of biochar, and the biochar reduced the concentration of PFOS over 90%. Aside from this study, the immobilization technique has been used only at a few military sites or airports or industrial sites. Laboratory-scale experiments have been conducted with contaminated soils collected from airports or military sites or industrial sites. The potential for the immobilization technique to remove PFAS contamination originating from biosolids application is currently not well understood, especially for the level of PFAS contamination found in biosolids and how much it contributes to current background levels. Hence, investigations are required using soils amended with PFAS-containing biosolids to evaluate the efficacy of the immobilization technique for PFAS removal.

## 5.5. Destruction

Destruction is the most desirable remediation option for contaminant removal. Destruction techniques are thermal treatment, chemical oxidation, biological remediation, electron-beam treatment, and ball milling. However, destruction is not easy in the case of PFAS remediation due to a strong C–F bond and the high melting point of PFAS. So far, destruction techniques have been applied only at the laboratory scale. Field-scale application of these techniques has not yet been successful.

Studies conducted so far have reported that the high melting point of PFAS makes thermal-treatment methods difficult. There are few reports about this treatment process, which suggests that thermal treatment is not feasible and sustainable due to high energy consumption and harmful effects of heat on soil. Chemical oxidation is one of the options to degrade PFAS, and it can be either ex-situ or in situ. The commonly used oxidants for in situ chemical oxidation are ozone, hydrogen peroxide, potassium/sodium permanganate, and sodium persulfate. Details about the chemical-oxidation technique for PFAS removal reported that heat-activated persulfate efficiently degraded PFCA compounds. Persulfate treatment removed PFOA when injected repeatedly with a low dosage, but the efficiency of PFOS removal was less. The chemical oxidation method needs to have a thorough investigation of the balance of free radicals, reaction kinetics, and radical scavengers.

Bioremediation using microbes and plants is theoretically a promising destructive technique for remediation of PFAS. In practice, however, it is not feasible for PFAS removal due to the non-degradable nature of PFAS. Microbial degradation of PFAS has not been studied extensively, and the limited literature on the topic provides conflicting outcomes. Conversely, abiotic methods such as electron-beam treatment and ball milling are able to degrade PFAS. For example, mechanochemical ball milling experiments on soils from a Canadian firefighting training area indicated that PFOS concentrations can be lowered by up to 96% in the contaminated soils. Electron beam (eBeam) technology utilizes electron accelerators to generate extremely large numbers of highly energetic electrons from electricity. Recently, eBeam technology to treat PFAS contaminated soils noticed that 2000 kGy dose reduced PFOS and PFOA concentration in Wurtsmith Air Force Base soils by > 99.9% and 53.7%, respectively. These novel techniques can be used to achieve a complete defluorination of PFAS in biowastes and biowaste-treated soils. The literature survey concerning different remediation techniques for PFAS removal showed that there are no well-developed remediation methods for PFAS removal, especially for biowaste-treated soils. In addition, most of the literature documenting destruction techniques targets only PFAS contamination in aqueous systems, and less attention has been paid to the removal of PFAS in soil ecosystems. Hence more studies are needed concerning the enhanced degradation of PFAS in contaminated soil. PFAS removal from biosolids-amended soil requires special attention, because application of biosolids is inadvertently increasing the load of PFAS in soil.

### Summary and conclusions

Solid biowastes, including biosolids, animal and poultry manures, and composts, are major sources of PFAS input into the environment. Plant uptake of PFAS through the application of these biowastes is an important pathway of animal and human exposure to PFAS. Various approaches have been used to remediate PFAS in biowastes and soil treated with these biowastes. Source control to prevent PFAS reaching the environment through biowaste application can be achieved by removing PFAS during the wastewater treatment process and avoiding PFAS containing organic wastes during the composting process. Removal of PFAS in biowastes might be achieved by thermal and chemical oxidation techniques, but they are difficult to carry out. Mobilizing amendments including surfactants and desorbing agents, can be applied to increase the bioavailability and mobility of PFAS in biowastes and in soil treated with these biowastes. The mobilized PFAS can subsequently be removed through phytoremediation or soil washing. Immobilizing amendments, such as sorbent materials, can be used to decrease the bioavailability and mobility of PFAS, thereby minimising their uptake by plants and leaching to groundwater. One of the limitations of the mobilizing technique is susceptibility to leaching of the mobilized PFAS in the absence of active plant uptake of PFAS. Similarly, in the case of the immobilization technique, the long-term stability of the immobilized PFAS needs to be monitored.

### Future research priorities

Given the present understanding on the distribution of PFAS in solid biowastes and contamination of soil resulting from the application of these biowastes, we propose the following future research priorities:
- Identification of PFAS sources reaching biowastes used for soil application, and development of guidelines to reduce these sources reaching the biowastes (i.e., source control).
- Greater understanding on the distribution of various PFAS in different components of solid biowastes used for soil application.
- Examination of transformation of PFAS during treatment and conversion of solid biowastes to other products, such as conversion of biosolids to biochar.
- More in situ field studies to demonstrate the effect of a wide range of mobilizing agents in removing PFAS and of immobilizing agents in reducing the mobility and bioavailability of PFAS from biowastes and soil treated with these biowastes.
- Development of methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of mobilization techniques on the subsequent uptake of PFAS by plants and biota from soil receiving biowastes.
- Development of analytical techniques to examine the in situ long-term stability and effectiveness of immobilization of PFAS in biowastes and soil receiving these biowastes.
- In situ field studies to monitor phytotoxicity and eco-receptor endpoints to demonstrate the environmental risk reduction derived from N. Bolan et al.
