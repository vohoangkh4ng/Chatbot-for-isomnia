# Title: Succession of marine bacteria in response to Ulva prolifera-derived dissolved organic matter

## Summary: This article investigates the dynamics of marine bacterial communities in response to dissolved organic matter (DOM) released from the macroalga Ulva prolifera, which has caused significant green tides in the Yellow Sea of China. Through a 168-hour microcosm incubation experiment, the study found that DOM inputs led to increased bacterial abundances, decreased diversity, and distinct community successions. Notably, Vibrio species rapidly proliferated in the early stages, while other bacterial genera emerged later. The research highlights the potential environmental impacts of bacterial responses to algal blooms, including both ecological restoration and health risks associated with pathogenic bacteria.
