## Background

Phthalates have been largely used for years in varieties of products worldwide. However, research on the joint toxic effect of various phthalates exposure on the liver is lacking.

## Objectives

We aimed to assess exposure to phthalates on liver function tests (LFTs).

## Methods

This analysis included data on 6046 adults (≥20 years old) who participated in a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2007–2016. We employed linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), to explore the associations of urinary phthalate metabolites with 8 indicators of LFTs.

## Results

Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (ΣDEHP) was found to be positively associated with serum alanine amino-transferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (all P FDR < 0.05). We found significant positive associations of ΣDEHP, mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) and mono-(carboxyisononyl) phthalate (MCNP) with total bilirubin (TBIL) (all P FDR < 0.05). ΣDEHP, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) were negatively associated with serum ALB (all P FDR < 0.05). The BKMR analyses showed a significantly positive overall effect on ALT, AST, ALP and TBIL levels with high concentrations of phthalate metabolites and a significantly negative overall effect on ALB and TP, when all the chemicals at low concentrations.

## Conclusions

Our results add novel evidence that exposures to phthalates might be adversely associated with the indicators of LTFs, indicating the potential toxic effect of phthalate exposures on the human liver.

## 1. Introduction

Over the past decades, liver diseases have risen to become one of the leading causes of death and illness around the world. There are concerted efforts to deal with the rising tide of liver disease, and an improved understanding of risk factors for liver function is needed to inform future disease control and prevention efforts. The liver function tests (LFTs) have been the mainstay of liver disease identification since they were developed in the 1950s. Accumulating evidence suggested that many chemicals and environmental pollutants could lead to liver dysfunction and increase liver disease risk.

Phthalates, a class of multifunctional chemicals with endocrine-disrupting properties, are ubiquitous in the environment. Low-molecular-weight phthalates, such as diethyl phthalate (DEP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), are widely used in solvents and personal care products (e.g., cosmetics and shampoos). High-molecular-weight phthalates, such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and diisononyl phthalate (DNP), are used primarily as plasticizers in vinyl plastic applications found in building materials.

and food packaging. Human beings are widely exposed to phthalates via dermal exposure, inhalation of polluted air and ingestion of contaminated food and water, and the daily intake of phthalates could reach 70 μg/kg/day. Exposure to phthalates has been reported to inhibit liver detoxifying enzymes and result in liver dysfunction, given the liver plays a pivotal role in detoxification of pollutants including phthalates. It has been demonstrated that phthalates are hepatotoxic to mice, zebrafish and quail. However, whether human exposures to phthalates could induce clinically relevant liver function disorder is still inconclusive, due to the exposure level and the pharmacokinetics in humans are different from that in animals. Considering humans are exposed to mixtures of pollutants rather than a single pollutant in real life, assessment for associations between phthalates exposures (as both an individual and a mixture) and liver function in an epidemiological study is warranted. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 6046 adults in the United States, who participated in the 2007–2016 survey cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We fitted survey-weighted linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to evaluate the relationships between urinary phthalate metabolites (internal biomarkers of phthalate exposures) and 8 indicators of LFTs, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB), total protein (TP) and AST/ALT.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Study population

The NHANES is conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) using a complex sampling frame to attain a sample representative of the United States population since 1960. The study protocol was approved by the NCHS Research Ethics Review Board, and participants provided consents. The present analysis included measurements from ten years (2007–2016) of the NHANES data, which were publicly shared and downloaded from the CDC official website, and merged according to the NHANES tutorials. There were 10,346 subjects from these years who had data on phthalate metabolites, urine creatinine (Cr), and LFTs, and among whom 8474 were aged 20 years or above. We excluded 2255 individuals with missing data on essential covariates, including the ratio of family income to poverty, education, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, serum cotinine, or alcohol consumption. After further excluding subjects with pregnancy (n = 78) or positive serology for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus (n = 95), 6046 participants were included in our final analysis. The participant selection procedure is shown in Figure S1. There were no significant differences between excluded and included participants in basic characteristics, such as physical activity and drinking status.

### 2.2. Urinary phthalate metabolites

Urine specimens were processed using enzymatic deconjugation of the glucuronidated phthalate monoesters followed by on-line solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled with reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA, USA) for the quantitative detection of phthalate metabolites, as described elsewhere. Phthalate metabolites including mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-(carboxyisoctyl) phthalate (MCOP), mono-(carboxyisononyl) phthalate (MCNP), mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-cyclohexyl phthalate (MCHP), mono-isononyl phthalate (MiNP), mono-n-octyl phthalate (MnOP), mono-n-methyl phthalate (MnMP) in urine were detected. Of the 15 phthalate metabolites, MCHP, MiNP, MnOP and MnMP with >40% of measurements below the limits of detection (LOD) were excluded in our analysis. The LODs of the remaining 11 urinary phthalate metabolites used in our study was in a range of 0.2–1.2 ng/mL. Concentrations below LODs were replaced with a value of the LOD divided by the square root of two. We combined DEHP metabolites (MEHP, MECPP, MEHHP and MEOHP) into the molar sum, and which was multiplied by the molar weight of MEHP (MW = 278) to compare with other phthalate metabolites, and expressed as ΣDEHP. We used urine creatinine (Cr) to calibrate the level of phthalate metabolites in urine and finally presented as μg/mmol Cr.

### 2.3. The indicators of LFTs

Both transaminases (ALT and AST) are enzymes released after hepatocytes necrosis or liver cell membrane damage, they are elevated in serum during acute liver damage. ALP is a marker of cholestasis, and GGT is used in clinical practice to ascertain the liver source of an increased ALP. The concentration of TBIL in serum is determined by the balance between bilirubin production and clearance by hepatocytes. Thus, elevated serum bilirubin levels may be due to the decreased ability in clearing injured hepatocytes or increased release of bile ducts. Decreased ALB and TP mainly imply limited liver synthesis. AST/ALT is the ratio between the concentrations of the AST and ALT. A greater increase in ALT than AST is probably related to hepatocyte injury. LFTs in serum were measured by using different methods with Beckman Coulter DxC800 Synchron clinical system. ALT, AST, GGT and ALP activity were measured by using a kinetic rate method, TBIL was measured by using a timed-endpoint diazo method, ALB was quantitatively determined using a bichromatic digital endpoint method, and TP was measured by using a timed rate biuret method.

### 2.4. Covariates

All covariates included in the models were selected a priori according to prior empirical evidence associated with phthalate exposure and liver function. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level, the ratio of family income to poverty, physical activity, alcohol consumption and taking medications that may affect liver function were collected from participants by household surveys. The ratio of family income to poverty ≥1 means at or above the poverty level. Self-reported vigorous or moderate recreational physical activity was categorized as “inactive” (<10 min per week) and “activity” (≥10 min per week). The definition of drinker was drinking more than 28 g/d for women and 42 g/d for men in the previous 12 months. A wide variety of drugs may be associated with liver function and diseases, and we selected the most commonly implicated including carbamazepine, methyldopa, minocycline, macrolide antibiotics, nitrofurantoin, statins, sulfonamides, terbinafine, chlorpromazine, methotrexate, hormone drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, medications use was defined as have taken the above medicines in the past month. BMI was measured by trained health technicians, and calculated as body weight (kilograms) divided by squared height (meters). Serum cotinine (as a biomarker of smoking) was measured by an isotope dilution-high performance liquid chromatography / atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry, as described elsewhere. In this study, subjects with serum cotinine ≤ 10 ng/mL ### 2.5. Statistical analysis
Because levels of all phthalates metabolites and some indicators of LFTs, including ALT, AST, GGT and ALP were in right-skewed distributions, these variables were transformed by the natural logarithm (ln) to improve data normality when they were treated as continuous variables in statistical models. Pairwise correlations of phthalate metabolite concentrations were evaluated by Spearman correlation coefficients.

#### 2.5.1. Linear regression
We conducted survey-weighted linear regression to assess the associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and indicators of LFTs with each chemical modeled as a continuous exposure variable and each indicator of LFTs modeled as a continuous outcome variable. We also explored the potential dose–response relationships between individual metabolites and indicators of LFTs across quartiles of urinary phthalate metabolites with the first quartile as a referent. Additionally, stratification analyses by smoking, alcohol consumption and BMI were conducted and effects modification was estimated via adding an interaction term in the regression model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding participants who had a liver condition in the questionnaire survey (n = 97). P values were adjusted by the method of Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction to adjust for multiple testing.

#### 2.5.2. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR)
To evaluate the joint effect of multiple chemicals on indicators of LFTs, and the potential synergistic effect among mixture components, we implemented BKMR, a powerful statistical approach for analyzing multipollutant mixtures. The cumulative effects of the mixtures were assessed by estimating the expected change in indicators of LFTs associated with concurrent changes in all of the components of the mixture from their median levels. We fitted separate BKMR models for all indicators of LFTs outcomes based on the model below:

Yi = h(ΣDEHP, MEP, MiBP, MBP, MCOP, MCNP, MCPP, MBzP) + βzi + ei

where Yi is the continuous LFT outcome; h() is the exposure–response function, which can incorporate non-linear relationships and interactions among the mixture components; β represents coefficient; zi is a vector of covariates. BKMR can also be used as a variable selection tool, identifying the relative importance of individual exposure variables to the overall mixture effect by estimating posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs), with values ranging from 0 to 1. A PIP threshold of 0.5 was used in this study. In addition, we conducted multivariate generalized additive models (GAMs), and used a tensor product smoother (ti) function to further evaluate the results of BKMR interaction. The GAM model included a term to measure the joint effect of urinary phthalate metabolites [i.e., ti(∑DEHP i, MCPPi)]. Only the results of GAM interaction P < 0.05 based on the BKMR results were described.

All models were adjusted for age (20–40/40–60/≥60 years), sex (male/female), race/ethnicity (Mexican American/Other Hispanic/Non-Hispanic White/Non-Hispanic Black/Other Race), education level (low/high), the ratio of family income to poverty (<1/≥1), BMI (<25/25–30/≥30), serum cotinine (smoker/non-smoker), alcohol consumption (drinker/non-drinker), physical activity (active/inactive) and medicine usage (yes/no). All significance levels were set to P < 0.05 (two-tailed) in this study. The survey-weighted linear regression analyses, BKMR and GAM were implemented in R 3.5.3 via the package “survey” (version 4.0), “bkmr” (version 0.2.0) and “mgcv” (version 1.8–28) respectively.

### 3. Results

#### 3.1. Descriptive statistics
The mean age of the 6046 participants was 48.2 ± 17.6 years, and there was slightly fewer male than female (48.3% vs. 51.7%). Most of the participants are non-Hispanic whites (44.0%), at or above the poverty level (78.8%), well educated (55.1%), non-drinker (53.8%), non-smoker (75.4%) and physically inactive (57.4%). The mean BMI was 29.2 ± 6.9 kg/m. A small proportion of participants took medicines that might affect liver function during a one-month period prior to the survey date (2.3%).

The detectable rates of most urinary phthalate metabolites were >92%, except MEHP with a detectable rate of 76.74%. The median urinary phthalate metabolites concentrations were 3.10, 5.76, 0.82, 1.31, 1.10, 0.24, 0.22 and 0.53 μg/mmol Cr for ΣDEHP, MEP, MiBP, MBP, MCOP, MCNP, MCPP and MBzP, respectively. Spearman correlation analysis showed that eight urinary phthalate metabolites were significantly correlated among themselves (P < 0.01), which suggested that data analysis with conventional regression method can be subject to multicollinearity, thus the BKMR model should be used for analysis.

#### 3.2. Associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and ALT or AST
The result of survey-weighted linear regression suggested that each 1 unit increase in ln-transformed concentration of urinary ∑DEHP was associated with 0.02 unit increase in ln-transformed concentration of ALT (P FDR = 0.003).

The BKMR analyses showed a significantly positive overall effect of phthalates on ALP levels when phthalate metabolites concentrations were all above the 55th percentile, as compared to their 50th percentile. Given no statistically significant overall effect was found in the GGT model. In the associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and GGT, we found that MCPP and ∑DEHP, as well as MCPP and MBP, may have interactions. For ALP, we found that there may be interactions between MiBP and MBzP, MBP and MBzP.

We observed positive dose–response relationships between urinary phthalate metabolites and ALT or AST. ALT and AST increased significantly when all phthalate metabolite concentrations were equal to or above 55th and 60th percentile, respectively, as compared with their first quartile of urinary ∑DEHP, MEP, MBP and MCNP.

Significant positive associations of ∑DEHP, MEP and MCNP with TBIL were found after adjusting for potential confounders. TBIL was higher in the higher quartiles (Q2–4) than in the first quartile (Q1) of urinary ∑DEHP, MEP, MBP and MCNP. L. Yu et al.

Associations between individual phthalate metabolites with TBIL, ALB and TP levels based on survey-weighted regression, and joint effects of the phthalate mixture on the liver function test levels estimated by Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) (N = 6046). All models adjusted for age (20–40/40–60/≥60 years), sex (male/female), race/ethnicity, education level (low/high), the ratio of family income to poverty (<1/≥1), BMI (<25/25–30/≥30), serum cotinine (smoker/non-smoker), alcohol consumption (drinker/non-drinker), physical activity (active/inactive) and medicine usage (yes/no).

(P for modification = 0.010, Table S3), and such the relationship was stronger in smokers (Table S3). In a single phthalate model, the results showed a significant association between ∑DEHP and AST/ALT (β = -0.004; P FDR = 0.035)

In BKMR analysis, the overall effect of mixtures was associated with increased TBIL when all phthalate metabolites were above their 55th percentile, as compared to their median (Fig. 2E). Among the phthalate metabolites, MiBP (PIP = 1.0), MBP (PIP = 0.97) and MCNP (PIP = 0.90) had the greatest effects on the above association (Table S6). There may be interactions between MCOP and MCNP, as well as MCOP and MCPP, in the associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and TBIL by using the methods of BKMR and GAM (Table S7, Figure S8). The results of the sensitivity analysis that excluded those who had the liver disease were consistent with the main analysis (Table S5).

3.5. Associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and ALB or TP
After adjusting for potential confounders, we found significant negative associations of ∑DEHP (β = -0.2; P FDR = 0.002), MBP (β = -0.3; P FDR = 0.002), MCPP (β = -0.2; P FDR = 0.002) and MBzP (β = -0.2; P FDR = 0.015) with ALB (Fig. 2, Table S2). Negative dose–response relationships of ∑DEHP, MBP, MCPP and MBzP with ALB were found (all P trend < 0.05) (Figure S3). The association between phthalate metabolites and TP showed no statistical significance after P value was adjusted by FDR. A negative association between MEP and TP (P trend < 0.05) was found (Figure S3). These significant associations were not modified by drinking status or smoking status in stratification analyses (P for modification > 0.05, Table S3). The relationships of MCNP and MBzP with ALB were modified by BMI (P for modification = 0.037, 0.002, respectively) (Table S4).

In BKMR analysis, a significantly negative overall effect of phthalate metabolite concentrations on ALB was observed when phthalate metabolites concentrations were all above the 55th percentile, as compared to their median (Fig. 2F). The overall effect of the mixture was significant on TP when levels of phthalate metabolite concentrations were at or below their 45th percentile, as compared to their 50th percentile, which suggests that TP could be declined with the increase of phthalates (Fig. 2G). The PIP of ∑DEHP (1.0) was extremely high in ALB, and MCNP (PIP = 1.0) was the highest in TP (Table S6).

ALT and AST are enzymes mainly present in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes; both are rarely released into the blood under normal circumstances. Increased ALT and AST activities are clinically used as markers of liver dysfunction. ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is mostly distributed in liver tissue. In the present study, the results indicated significant positive association between ∑DEHP and ALT, as well as MBP and AST. Partly consistent with our results, significant positive associations between DEHP and ALT or AST levels were found among 456 workers in polyvinyl chloride manufacturing facilities. Similar relationships of DEHP with ALT were also found in a small sample-sized (n = 100) general population-based survey in Serbia. Significantly increased AST activities in the MBP-treated group compared with the control group was observed in zebrafish, the study indicated that the antioxidant Nrf2-Keap1 pathway was insufficient to resist MBP-induced hepatotoxicity, and led to an imbalance of membrane ion homeostasis and liver damage. GGT is an enzyme located in the cell membrane of hepatocytes, not only abundant in the liver, but also in the kidneys, intestines, and pancreas. GGT is one of the best predictors for liver mortality and is clinically used to determine the liver source of increased ALP. Consistent with findings from previous studies conducted on animals and among 456 workers in polyvinyl chloride production plant, our findings showed that ∑DEHP levels were positively associated with GGT. ALP elevation is a marker to indicate abnormal liver function. The associations of urinary phthalate metabolites with ALP were found to be positive in our present study, which is inconsistent with the previous cross-sectional study conducted by Ferguson et al in the NHANES 1999–2016 with participants aged ≥6 years. Such inconsistency might be attributed to the differences in age of the study population. Additionally, findings from Ferguson et al might be biased because many important confounders such as drinking and medication usage were not adjusted in their study. On the other hand, several animal studies have shown that phthalate exposure can induce ALP elevation in serum and tissues, which supports our study findings.

TBIL comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions, elevations of either fraction will increase the measured bilirubin concentration. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually due to hemolysis or impaired conjugation, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system. The associations between phthalates and TBIL are largely unclear. Several phthalates were found to be negatively associated with TBIL in previous studies, where phthalates were believed to have the ability to cause oxidative stress while TBIL was supposed to have the effective antioxidant property. In our study, both the linear regression model and the BKMR model showed that urinary phthalate metabolites were positively associated with TBIL. Our findings were considered reasonable given the evidence that phthalate exposure was related to cholestasis. Unfortunately, our results cannot determine which fraction of TBIL has an effect on elevated serum bilirubin levels. More researches are needed to explore the associations between phthalate exposures and TBIL.

As ALB is only produced by the liver, the serum ALB concentration is usually considered as a marker of the synthetic function of the liver. Serum TP and ALB can reflect chronic liver damage and the reserve function of liver parenchymal cells. To our knowledge, no previous epidemiological study has ever reported the relationships between phthalate exposures and serum ALB and TP. Previous animal experiments have shown that phthalate exposure may lead to liver tissue pathological changes and reduced serum ALB levels; which support our findings that urinary phthalate metabolites were negatively correlated with ALB and TP.

The ratio of AST/ALT is often used in clinic to reflect the damage of liver cells, and differentiate between causes of liver damage and hepatotoxicity. In our study, ∑DEHP levels were negatively associated with AST/ALT. Given that the research on the relationship between urinary phthalate metabolites and AST/ALT is limited, more epidemiological and toxicological evidences are needed.

In the process of exploring the interaction of urinary phthalate metabolites, some differences between the results of BKMR and GAM were found. Such disparities are related to the properties of each method, including model specifications (non-parametric method vs. parametric method), model fitting algorithms (Bayesian and non-Bayesian), and the processing of variable selection, etc.

The biological actions of phthalates are very similar to the chemicals that are collectively called peroxisome proliferators (PPs), which activate different subtypes of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The liver is a primary target organ of the pleiotropic action of PPs. A number of studies focusing on rats and mice have shown that phthalates are hepatotoxic in rodents through the activation of PPARs. In addition, both primary and secondary metabolites of DEHP can activate PPARα and other isoforms of this nuclear receptor family in humans. Additionally, phthalates could also cause PPARα-independent changes including intracellular kinases activation, enzyme inhibition or interactions with other molecular targets. Generally, there are a number of molecular signals and multiple pathways that can cause liver damage in susceptible species. Various phthalate metabolites may cause liver damage through more than one pathway.

To our knowledge, our report is the first study to analyze the joint effect of several urinary phthalate metabolites on LFTs. The present study has several notable strengths. First, we employed the BKMR model, a novel and flexible statistical model that is able to quantify and visualize the joint effect of the mixture. Second, we assessed the relationship between phthalate exposure and liver function in a nationally representative population, and the sample size was relatively large. Third, our use of sensitive and specific biomarkers to assess individual phthalate exposure (a measurement of phthalates metabolites rather than parent phthalate diesters) is more relevant. However, our study also has several limitations. Firstly, the cross-sectional study design does not permit any causal inference, and, the results of our research sample may not be generalized to the worldwide. Secondly, although many potential confounders were taken into account, we cannot adjust all possible covariates (e.g., other environmental chemicals) in our analyses and potential residual confounding might lead bias to the reported estimates. Thirdly, urinary phthalates metabolites were determined using spot urine (rather than 24-hour urine), which might introduce potential measurement error due to the individual variation in the excretion of metabolites throughout the day. However, the collection of a 24-h urine sample is burdensome for subjects, which can limit participation and affect the representativeness of participants in population surveys, while spot urine is widely accepted and used. Although LFTs are acute indicators that can be significantly affected by short-term exposure to pollutants including phthalates, more complex associations between phthalates exposures and LFTs may exist but cannot be uncovered at this stage due to the short half-lives of urinary phthalates metabolites.

## Conclusion

Using the NHANES 2007–2006 data of the US adult population, we found that several urinary phthalate metabolites and their mixtures were significantly associated with 8 indicators of LFTs. Our findings suggest that exposure to phthalates may be associated with liver dysfunction, and it may be prudent to monitor the liver outcomes for people with phthalates exposures. More researches are warranted to validate our findings and assess the hepatotoxicity of phthalates. References
