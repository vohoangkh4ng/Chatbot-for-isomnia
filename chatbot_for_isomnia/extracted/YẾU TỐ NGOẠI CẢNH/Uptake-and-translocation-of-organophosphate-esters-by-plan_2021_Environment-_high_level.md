# Title: Uptake and translocation of organophosphate esters by plants: Impacts of chemical structure, plant cultivar and copper

## Summary: This article investigates the uptake and translocation of organophosphate esters (OPEs) by various plant cultivars, focusing on the influence of OPEs' chemical structure and the presence of copper (Cu). The study finds that OPEs accumulate differently in plants, with carrots showing the highest levels and maize the lowest. It highlights that OPEs with electron-ring substituents are more readily absorbed by plant roots compared to those with open-chain substituents. The presence of Cu affects the uptake dynamics, indicating that hydrophobicity plays a significant role in the translocation of OPEs within plants. The findings contribute to understanding the ecological risks associated with OPEs in the food chain.
