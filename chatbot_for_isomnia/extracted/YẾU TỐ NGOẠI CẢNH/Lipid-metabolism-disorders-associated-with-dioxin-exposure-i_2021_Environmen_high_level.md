# Title: Lipid metabolism disorders associated with dioxin exposure in a cohort of Chinese male workers revealed by a comprehensive lipidomics study

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of dioxin exposure on lipid metabolism in a cohort of Chinese male workers. By analyzing serum lipid profiles through a comprehensive lipidomics approach, the research identifies significant alterations in lipid levels between high and low dioxin exposure groups. Key findings include the accumulation of triglycerides, ceramides, and sphingoid lipids, as well as imbalances in free fatty acid metabolism. The results suggest potential health risks linked to dioxin exposure, including inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and liver diseases, marking the first exploration of these associations at the lipid metabolism level.
