# Title: Effects of single and combined gestational phthalate exposure on blood pressure, blood glucose and gestational weight gain: A longitudinal analysis

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of gestational exposure to phthalates on metabolic risks, specifically focusing on blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and gestational weight gain among 3,273 women in the Maâ€™anshan Birth Cohort. The research highlights that exposure to phthalate metabolites during the first trimester is associated with increased risks of hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and excessive weight gain. The findings suggest that both single and cumulative phthalate exposures can adversely affect maternal metabolic health, although some results showed conflicting relationships between phthalate metabolites and their diesters.
