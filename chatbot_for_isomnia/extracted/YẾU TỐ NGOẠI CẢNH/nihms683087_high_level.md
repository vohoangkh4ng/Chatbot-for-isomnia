# Title: Sleep in the modern family: protective family routines for child and adolescent sleep

## Summary: This article presents findings from the 2014 National Sleep Foundation Sleep in America Poll, which aimed to assess sleep patterns in families with school-aged children. The study utilized a cross-sectional design with a nationally representative sample of US households. Key measurements included parental perceptions of sleep importance, sleep quality, duration, and habits of both parents and children, as well as the influence of technology in bedrooms. Despite most parents recognizing the significance of sleep, the results indicated that 90% of children are not getting the recommended amount of sleep. The article discusses the implications of these findings for family routines and child sleep health.
