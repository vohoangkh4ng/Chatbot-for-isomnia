# Effect of thermal environment on sleep quality in actual bedroom in summer by sleep stages analysis

## Abstract
This field survey was conducted during summer in actual bedrooms and used polysomnography to evaluate the effect of thermal environment on sleep quality by analyzing electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, and electromyogram signals, which were continuously measured during sleep. It was found that the effect of the thermal environment (ie, air temperature, air velocity, and air turbulence) on sleep quality varied according to the sleep cycle and stages. The effect of air turbulence depended mainly on the air temperature. At low or neutral temperatures, air turbulence had negative effects on sleep quality, whereas under warm temperatures, air turbulence had negligible effects on sleep quality.

## 1. Introduction
Recently, the nights have become sultry due to the rise in outdoor air temperatures caused by the heat-island phenomenon. Consequently, the number of people facing trouble sleeping is increasing. The economic loss caused by sleeping disorder per day in summer in Osaka is estimated to amount to hundreds of millions of JPY. In addition, it is very important to have a good sleep because sleep quality affects both health and work efficiency.

The thermal environment is considered as one of the factors influencing sleep and several investigations have been carried out to determine the influence of the thermal environment on sleep. Miyazawa et al pointed out that there is a close relationship between sleep and the thermoregulatory functions of our bodies. It was found that the thermoregulatory function reduces during sleep, and therefore the amount of heat dissipation is adjusted by increasing the exposed surface area of the body through body movements. Candas et al investigated the influence of the thermal stimulus on sleep stages via changes in air temperature from 25°C to 41°C or 17°C. The hot and cold stimuli disturbed sleep, and the influence depended on the sleep stage. Because thermoregulatory function becomes inactive during REM sleep, which is one of the sleep stages with rapid eye movement while closed eye and dreams occur, it was suggested that the amount of REM sleep decreased due to the necessity of thermoregulation. Similarly, Muzet et al conducted experiments under different temperature conditions (13°C, 16°C, 19°C, 22°C, and 25°C) and indicated that the higher the environmental temperatures, the shorten the cycle of REM sleep. These results show that the thermal environment affects the thermoregulatory function of our body and disturbs sleep.

Therefore, maintaining an appropriate thermal environment decreases body movement during sleep and leads to improved quality of sleep. In summer, 90% of the residents living in Kanto and Kansai areas adapt to the thermal environment in the bedrooms using air conditioners or electric fans. conducted experiments under different temperature conditions (17°C, 20°C, and 23°C) in winter and indicated that the sleep latency becomes shorter and the deep sleep time becomes longer at 23°C. Lan et al conducted experiments under different temperature conditions (23°C, 26°C, and 30°C) in summer. In each condition, the air velocity was less than 0.1 m/s, and the radiant temperature was almost the same as the air temperature, but the relative humidity varied between 50% and 70%. The sleep latency became shortened and the deep sleep time increased at 26°C. Haskell et al

environment in bedrooms. In this study, for the purpose of clarifying the influence of the thermal environment in the actual bedroom on the sleep quality, field surveys were conducted in the bedrooms of each subject during summer. We investigated the state of sleep elaborately by using electroencephalography in actual bedrooms. The effects of the thermal environment on sleep quality were analyzed using the measurements of the thermal environment during sleep, the physiological measurements including brain waves, and the self-evaluation. This paper is a revised version of the content presented at the annual meeting of the Architectural Institute of Japan in 2016.

So many studies have been studying for a long time focused on the relationship between sleep quality and air temperature. On the other hand, studies focusing on the relationship between sleep quality and air movement have been conducted as well. Morito et al compared the sleep quality at different air velocities. The investigated conditions were: air velocity of 0.3 or 1.1 m/s at the same air temperature of 26°C in the bedroom. It was found that the higher air velocity inhibited sleep and its influence became larger in the later periods of sleep. Tsuzuki et al reported on the influence of airflow on sleep at high temperatures and humidity. Experiments were conducted under three conditions: “26°C/50%RH,” “32°C/80% RH,” and “32°C/80% RH/ air velocity 1.4 m/s.” The results showed that in a hot and humid environment, the air movement improved sleep quality. In addition, Miyake et al conducted field surveys in bedrooms during summer and transition seasons. The subjects had lower sleep quality as the air turbulence in a bedroom was conducted. No special conditions were set to evaluate sleep as usual. Most subjects wore short-sleeved t-shirts and short-pants. The average thermal insulation of the clothing and bedding system at bedtime was 0.35 ± 0.11 K-m²/W (2.25 ± 0.71 clo) as determined from the study of Lin et al.

The thermal environment and physiological measurements were monitored continuously during the sleep sessions in each subject’s bedroom. The measured parameters are shown in Table 1. It is known that the head is the most sensitive to the changes in environment; therefore, the measuring equipment was attached to a stand and placed at the same level next to the pillow. The measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, and globe temperature were instantaneous, whereas a mean value for 10 seconds was considered for measuring air velocity. We evaluated the objective sleep quality every 30 seconds by analyzing continuously measured EEG, EOG, and EMG signals.

The psychological parameters are listed in Table 2. The subjects made declarations on their perceived psychological state and thermal adaptation methods at both bedtime and wake-up time. The installation position, air volume, timer setting, and other setting of the air

### Results of the Field Survey about Thermal Adaptation

#### Outdoor temperature
The relationship between average daily outdoor temperature and average outdoor temperature during sleep is shown in Figure 3. A positive correlation was observed between the average daily outdoor temperature and the average outdoor temperature during sleep. The method to adjust the thermal environment during sleep was selected before bedtime, and Figure 4 shows the ratios of different environmental control methods for various average daily outdoor temperature ranges. When the average daily outdoor temperature was 25°C or less, “Nothing Used” or “Open Window” was selected. As the average daily outdoor temperature increased, the ratio of selecting “Air Conditioner” also increased. The thermal adaptation method seemed to change depending on the thermal environment of the bedroom.

Figure 5. Example of temporal change of thermal environment in the bedroom and sleep stage in an air-conditioning situation

It seemed that a comfortable thermal environment was temperature before sleep. The average air temperature was achieved without relying on artificial environmental adjustment methods such as air conditioners and electric fans. The air movement in “Air Conditioner” and “Electric Fan” meant for improving the hot environment partially inhibited sleep, as also found by Morito et al. The air temperature during sleep was predominantly about 27°C. It was presumed that the air temperature in the bedroom was adjusted before sleep onset. As shown in Figure 7, at 25–28°C, there was no case where the sleep latency exceeded 30 minutes and the ratio of sleep latency less than 10 minutes was the highest compared to other temperature ranges. The ratio of sleep latency more than 30 minutes became most significant when the temperature was more than 28°C. This observation of sleep latency of shortening in the thermally neutral temperature range is consistent with Lan et al.

Figure 8 shows the relationship of sleep latency with air temperature before sleep. The air temperature at bedtime was binned in increments of 1°C, and the average sleep latency in each bin was calculated. To investigate the mean significant difference of each sleep latency, one-way ANOVA with logarithmic transformation of sleep latency and multiple comparisons by the Tukey-Kramer method were performed. The mean sleep latency in the thermally neutral temperature range of 25–28°C tended to be short all within 10 minutes. Moreover, the sleep latency at 25°C became significantly shorter than that under 24°C. Therefore, it can be considered that air temperature is related to the easiness of sleep onset. The number of measurements on both the cold side and the hot side was

small, so verification by increasing the number of measurements is necessary.

4.2 Sleep efficiency
Figures 9 and 10 shows the relationship of sleep efficiency with air temperature and air velocity, respectively. The average overnight air temperature and air velocity was binned in increments of 1°C and 0.05 m/s, respectively. The average sleep efficiency within each bin was calculated. The size of the bubble indicates the amount of data per plot. The sleep efficiency was high within the air temperature range of 24–28°C and tended to decrease beyond the neutral temperature range. In addition, sleep efficiency tended to decrease with increasing airflow rate. Compared to the air velocities in previous studies, the air velocities in this study were not extremely high as they were measured in actual bedrooms. Although no extreme air velocities were observed in the actual environment, the sleep quality was affected even at relatively low air velocities. Thus, thermal factors of air temperature and air velocity affected sleep efficiency, which is the quality of sleep overnight.

4.3 Sleep stage
The average percentages of sleep stages are shown in Figure 11. The percentage of sleep stage 2 is generally expected to be high demonstrated by the results of the current study.

4.4 Sleep cycle
The boxplot of time of sleep cycle is presented in Figure 12. To investigate the significant difference of the average time of sleep cycle, the following data was collected:

each sleep cycle, one-way analysis of variance, and multiple comparisons by Tukey-Kramer method were performed. The period from the start of non-REM sleep to the end of REM sleep was defined as one sleep cycle. The length of the sleep cycle varied across the subjects, and this study confirmed up to the fifth cycle. The average duration of a sleep cycle was about 80–100 minutes with cycle 2 being the longest and cycle 5 being the shortest. This is possibly because cycle 5 occurs immediately before awakening and the period has decreased due to waking up in the middle of the cycle. In this study, we found cycle 1 to be relatively short and cycle 2 was the longest. After the second cycle, the duration of each following sleep cycle tended to decrease. A similar result (in terms of shorter cycles over time) was obtained in the study by Muzet et al.

Figure 13 charts the percentages of sleep stages during each sleep cycle and demonstrates the influence of the sleep cycle on the sleep stage ratios. The ratio of deep sleep was higher in the earlier sleep cycles, and to compensate for the decrease in deep sleep, shallow sleep, and REM sleep increased in the later sleep cycles along with a slight increase in wake. Figure 11 also represents much of this result.

4.5  Occurrence rate of WASO

The thermal environment was averaged overnight to correctly evaluate its relationship with sleep efficiency. Because the thermal environment constantly changed overnight, it was necessary to evaluate the short measurement intervals. Therefore, air temperature and air velocity were measured every 30 seconds to evaluate the influence of their changes on sleep quality. The ratio of the occurrence of WASO to TST was defined as the occurrence rate of WASO. As a correlation was observed between occurrence rate of WASO and sleep efficiency, the occurrence rate of WASO has been used as an evaluation index of sleep quality in this study.

In addition, Figure 15 shows the average occurrence rate of WASO at each sleep stage. The occurrence rate of WASO from shallow sleep was higher than the rate from deep sleep, and this rate was high for all sleep stages in later sleep. Since the ratio of shallow sleep in later sleep was high, it can be considered that the frequency of WASO at later sleep period increased due to this reason.

Furthermore, Figure 16 shows the occurrence rate of WASO during each sleep cycle. The occurrence rate of WASO varies depending on the sleep cycle, and in comparison, the rate was the lowest in cycle 1 and gradually increased in the following cycles. As the duration of deep sleep was long in early sleep,

|                   | 1,521    |

correlation between the air temperature and the occurrence rate of WASO. The regression curves of cycle 2 and cycle 3 almost overlapped, and the air temperature at which the rate became lowest was about 26°C. Therefore, we considered the large influence of air temperature on sleep quality in the middle of sleep. In cycle 1, which is immediately after sleep onset, the rate of deep sleep is high and the occurrence rate of WASO is low, so it is considered that the thermal environment has an inferior effect in this cycle. Meanwhile, as cycles 4 and cycle 5 occur in the later sleep periods, where the ratio of shallow sleep is high, it is presumed that WASO based on other factors than air temperature was likely to occur. Therefore, it is important to keep the air temperature at the appropriate mark, especially during the middle of sleep, when it is easily affected by the air temperature. The influence of air temperature on sleep latency at sleep onset shown in Figure 8 highlights the importance of adjusting and maintaining the appropriate thermal environment in the bedroom before and during sleep.

5. Statistical Evaluation of Relationship between Sleep Quality and Thermal Environment

In chapter 4, the influence of the thermal environment on sleep quality has been demonstrated and evaluated from various aspects. In this chapter, probit regression analysis was conducted to statistically analyze the influence of the thermal factors, such as air temperature, air velocity, and air turbulence, on the occurrence rate of WASO at each sleep stage. A probit regression analysis is an inverse function of the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution, which is widely used in predicting the probabilities of human physiological and psychological reactions. As it is used for analysis with binary data, the objective variable in this study was analyzed as either 0) without WASO, or 1) WASO.
Table 4 shows the results of probit regression for every thermal factor in each sleep stage with the explanatory variables of air temperature, air velocity, and air turbulence. Because the influence of the air velocity on the sleep quality differed depending on the air temperature, the range of temperature was divided into three divisions: less than 25°C, 25–28°C (thermal neutral), and higher than 28°C. Table 4 presents the probit analysis results—coefficients of determination and P-values, with up to 10% significance level to show the significance trend. Comparing the factors, the air temperature was often found to affect the occurrence rate of WASO. Moreover, air velocity and air turbulence may affect sleep quality depending on the sleep stage and temperature range. We discuss the relation between the occurrence rate of WASO and each factor.

5.1 Air temperature
Figure 18 shows the relationship between air temperature and occurrence rate of WASO. For each sleep stage, the explanatory variable was air temperature binned in 1°C increments. In environments having air temperatures less than 25°C, the occurrence rate of WASO increased as the air temperature decreased. The increase in the occurrence rate of WASO in stage 1 + 2 was the highest. As in the case of 25–28°C, the rate at each sleep stage was low and remained almost uninfluenced by the air temperature. Since neutral temperature is considered to be comfortable, it was expected that there will be no correlation between sleep quality and air temperature. However, when the temperature got closer to 28°C (somewhat hot), the occurrence rate of WASO slightly increased with the increase in temperature. At temperatures higher than 28°C, the occurrence rate of WASO increased with increasing of air temperature in all sleep stages. As the analysis was carried out in each temperature section, the regression curve did not directly connect at the boundary but slightly shifted. Across all temperature ranges, the occurrence rate of WASO was lowest in deep sleep. The reason may be of sensitivity to thermal stimulus, as thermoregulatory function decreases in REM sleep and there exists more susceptibility to WASO during shallow sleep. From Table 4, it can be said that compared to air movement, the air temperature had a stronger influence on the occurrence rate of WASO and sleep quality.

5.2 Air velocity
Figure 19 shows the relationship between air velocity and occurrence rate of WASO. The explanatory variable was air velocity binned in 0.1 m/s increments, which was categorized under three temperature ranges. The analysis was conducted for all sleep stages. Figure 19 shows that the relationship between air velocity and the occurrence rate of WASO is statistically significant only when the air temperature is not categorized. Only in stage 3 + 4, there was an increasing tendency in the occurrence rate of WASO with increasing air velocity. There were no statistically significant relationships when the air temperature was not categorized. In the previous studies, it was found that the influence of airflow on sleep depends on the thermal environment. However, in the current analysis, no significance was confirmed upon analyzing the influence of air velocity on sleep. The possible reason can be considered as air velocity greatly fluctuates compared to air temperature and the measured value records a discontinuous value, so the analysis method could not properly evaluate the case where the reaction of WASO to environmental change was delayed. In addition, it was also considered that the air velocity levels in this survey were not so unpleasant to cause WASO.

5.3 Air turbulence
In addition to quantitative thermal factors such as air temperature and air velocity, air turbulence also affects sleep quality. Therefore, the relationship between air turbulence and the occurrence rate of WASO was also analyzed and has been presented in Figure 20. The method for calculating air turbulence is shown in Equation (1). Occurrence Rate of WASO [%]

The air turbulence was calculated from Equation (1) with the data of air velocity recorded in every 10 minutes interval. The explanatory variable was air turbulence binned into 5% increments, and the analysis was conducted for each sleep stage in the three separate temperature ranges. In temperatures higher than 28°C, no significant correlations were obtained. In the remaining two cases: temperatures less than 25°C and 25–28°C, the occurrence rate of WASO increased with the increase in air turbulence in stage 1 + 2 and stage 3 + 4. The slope of the regression curve obtained in 25–28°C was gentle for both stage 1 + 2 and stage 3 + 4 as compared to that in less than 25°C. The result shows that the influence of air turbulence on sleep quality depends on air temperature. There was no relationship between air turbulence and the occurrence rate of WASO during REM sleep. No significant correlations were observed between air turbulence and occurrence rate of WASO in cases higher than 28°C. It can be considered that although the air movement may inhibit sleep, it also improves the thermal environment in hot conditions. In a previous study, Miyake reported that air turbulence inhibits sleep. In this study, it was demonstrated that the influence of air turbulence on sleep quality depends on both air temperature and air velocity.

Figure 20. The relationship between air turbulence and occurrence rate of WASO

In this study, a field survey in an actual sleep environment (the subjects’ bedrooms) was conducted. We analyzed the sleep quality in detail by recording electroencephalography measurements across all sleep stages. The results obtained in the current field survey were similar to those from previous studies. The relationship between sleep quality and thermal environment (air temperature, air velocity, and air turbulence) was analyzed, and the following findings were obtained.

1. Before bedtime, the air temperature was often adjusted to around 27°C. By adjusting the thermal environment at sleep onset to a thermally neutral temperature, the sleep latency was shortened, and the sleep onset was accelerated.
2. The percentage of deep sleep was higher in early sleep cycles, whereas the percentage of shallow sleep was higher in the later ones. It was demonstrated that the occurrence rate of WASO was different in each sleep stage, and it is susceptible to thermal environment in shallow sleep. As compared to early periods of sleep, the occurrence rate of WASO increased across all sleep stages in the later periods of sleep. At thermally neutral temperatures, the sleep quality was better, the sleep efficiency was higher and the occurrence rate of WASO was lower than those at temperatures beyond this range. With similar results reported in a previous study, it was confirmed that results obtained in actual sleep environments were similar to those obtained in laboratory experiments.
3. The length of the sleep cycle was the longest in cycle 2 and tended to get shorter in the following cycles. Except for cycle 5, which is the cycle immediately before getting up, the length of each sleep cycle was approximately 80–100 minutes. The rate of deep sleep in cycle 1 was the highest. The rate of deep sleep decreased in later sleep periods, and the rate of REM and shallow sleep increased to complement it.
4. Upon analyzing the relationships between air temperature and the occurrence rate of WASO in every sleep cycle, a strong relationship was observed in cycle 2 and cycle 3 where both regression curves were nearly identical. The occurrence rate of WASO was lowest at about 26°C, which is considered to be a thermally neutral temperature. In the period immediately after sleep onset, the rate of deep sleep was high, so it is considered that there are few influences of air temperature. On the other hand, in the later sleep periods, the rate of REM and shallow sleep is considerably high. It is believed that WASO occurs due to other factors than the only air temperature. The influence of air temperature on sleep quality could vary depending upon the sleep cycle.
5. In this study, the air velocity was generally low, and no significant relationship between the air velocity and occurrence rate of WASO was found when analyzed for each temperature range. However, an increase in air velocity decreased sleep efficiency. Consequently, it was observed that an environment with higher air velocity throughout the night may result in lower sleep efficiency.
6. The influence of air turbulence varied depending on the air temperature range. In the cases of temperatures less than 25°C or within 25–28°C (thermally neutral temperature), it was observed that the occurrence rate of WASO increased with the increase in air turbulence in stage 1 + 2 and stage 3 + 4. The influence of air turbulence on the above rate was larger in lower temperatures. Moreover, no significance was confirmed in high-temperature environments. The influence of air turbulence on sleep quality may, not only disturb sleep, depend on air temperature. In previous studies, the results that air turbulence disturbs sleep was reported. In this study, it was elucidated that the influences of air turbulence on sleep varies with air temperature and each sleep stage. | Reference Number | Authors | Title | Journal/Source | Year | Volume | Pages |
