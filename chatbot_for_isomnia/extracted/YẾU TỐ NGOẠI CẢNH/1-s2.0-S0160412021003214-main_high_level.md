# Title: The impact of Traffic-Related air pollution on child and adolescent academic Performance: A systematic review

## Summary: This systematic review investigates the relationship between traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and academic performance in children and adolescents. Despite the known negative health impacts of TRAP, its effects on academic outcomes have been less studied. The review included 10 relevant articles, revealing that increased exposure to TRAP is generally associated with poorer academic performance. However, the evidence quality is low due to methodological heterogeneity and significant risk of bias in the studies. The authors suggest that future research should focus on using reliable exposure measures and longitudinal designs to better understand this relationship.
