# Title: Persistent organic pollutants and the size of ovarian reserve in reproductive-aged women

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and ovarian reserve in reproductive-aged women. It highlights how industrial chemicals, including organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls, may affect female fertility by influencing the quantity and quality of ovarian follicles. The study analyzes data from pregnant women undergoing elective caesarean sections, measuring both histological follicle density and serum anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) levels. The findings suggest that certain POPs are associated with decreased densities of non-growing follicles, although no significant correlations were found with AMH levels or healthy follicle densities.
