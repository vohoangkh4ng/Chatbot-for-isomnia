# Urban environment and obesity and weight-related behaviours in primary school children

## A R T I C L E I N F O

**Background:** Urban environments are characterised by many factors that may influence children’s lifestyle and increase the risk of childhood obesity, but multiple urban exposures have scarcely been studied.

**Keywords:**
- Urban environment
- Body mass index
- Childhood obesity
- Weight-related behaviours
- Cluster analyses

**Objective:** We evaluated the association between multiple urban exposures and childhood obesity outcomes and weight-related behaviours.

**Methods:** We conducted a cross-sectional study including 2213 children aged 9–12 years in Sabadell, Spain. We estimated ambient air pollution, green spaces, built and food environment, road traffic and road traffic noise at residential addresses through a total of 28 exposure variables in various buffers. Childhood obesity outcomes included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and body fat. Weight-related behaviours included diet (fast food and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption), physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep duration and well-being. Associations between exposures (urban environment) and outcomes (obesity and behaviours) were estimated in single and multiple-exposure regression models and in a hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC) analysis.

**Results:** Forty percent of children were overweight or obese. In single exposure models, very few associations were observed between the urban exposures and obesity outcomes or weight-related behaviours after correction for multiple testing. In multiple exposure models, PMcoarse, denser unhealthy food environment and land use mix were statistically significant associated with childhood obesity outcomes (e.g 17.7 facilities/km2 increase of unhealthy food environment (OR overweight/obesity status) = 1.20 [95% CI: 1.01; 1.44]). Cluster analysis identified 5 clusters of urban exposures. Compared to the most neutral cluster, the cluster with high air pollution, road traffic, and road noise levels was associated with a higher BMI and higher odds of overweight and obesity (β (zBMI) = 0.17, [95% CI: 0.01, 0.17]; OR (overweight/obesity) = 1.36, [95% CI: 0.99, 1.85]); the clusters were not associated with the weight-related behaviours.

**Conclusions:** This systematic study of many exposures in the urban environment suggests that an exposure pattern characterised by higher levels of ambient air pollution, road traffic and road traffic noise is associated with increased childhood obesity risk and that PMcoarse, land use mix and food environment are separately associated with obesity risk. These findings require follow-up in longitudinal studies and different settings. # Introduction

Increasing trends of childhood obesity seem to have plateaued or even slightly decreased in high-income countries in the last decade, but levels are still alarmingly high, especially in Spain which has the second highest prevalence levels of childhood obesity in Europe. Childhood obesity has been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea, dyslipidemia and mental health problems. Excessive weight status is a consequence of a chronic imbalance between excessive energy intake and/or reduced energy expenditure. The interaction of genetics, lifestyle behaviours and environmental exposures are likely to contribute to this imbalance. Additionally, the rapid growth of urban areas worldwide has greatly increased the levels of environmental stressors such as higher levels of air pollution, noise and lack of green spaces. This increasing degree of global urbanisation can influence personal behaviours of urban residents, such as physical activity levels and sedentary behaviour, and ultimately contribute to the energy imbalance.

A number of studies have recently reported associations between increased levels of air pollution, road traffic, and traffic noise, and increased childhood growth and obesity. Increased levels of green spaces, access to facilities, more diversity of land use, and more walkable areas have been reported to be protective against obesity in children. Most of these studies have reported single-exposure associations and have not systematically assessed associations for many urban exposures. To the best of our knowledge there have been only two studies that assessed the associations between multiple urban exposures and childhood obesity. The identification of combinations of exposures in urban environment that are more likely to be associated with childhood obesity may help policymakers and urban planners to identify which exposure clusters need to be addressed in order to make cities healthier and more liveable.

The mechanisms underlying the effects of the multiple urban exposures and childhood obesity are still poorly understood. Air pollution may disrupt molecular mechanisms known to underlie obesity pathogenesis. Noise has been associated with stress hormones and sleep deprivation, which are associated with physical development in childhood, increasing the risk of overweight in children. Green spaces, built environment factors and road traffic may partly determine the levels of air pollution and noise and in turn affect the levels of obesity. Further, the urban environment may influence several weight-related behaviours including well established obesity risk factors such as diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep duration and well-being. Poorer well-being may not be considered a direct weight-related behaviour, but poor mental health is associated with obesity and changes in diet and physical activity may be responsible for this. Better understanding of the associations between urban exposures with weight-related behaviours is important for the development of future community-level health promotion programs to improve healthy behaviours in the city, but there are only few studies on this in children. For instance, in adolescents and in adults, increasing levels of air pollution have been associated with increased fast food consumption and with decreased levels of physical activity, whereas higher green space exposure has been associated with increased levels of physical activity and improved quantity of sleep.

The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the association of multiple urban exposures (air pollution, green spaces, built and food environment, road traffic, and road traffic noise) and their patterns, with childhood obesity outcomes and weight-related behaviours.

# Methods

## Study design and study population

We conducted a cross-sectional school-based study between October 2017 and January 2019 in the city of Sabadell, Spain (approximately 200,000 inhabitants) within the ECHOCAT (Urban built environment and childhood obesity in Catalonia) project. We aimed to recruit all children in the 4th, 5th and 6th year of primary school (between 9 and 12 years old) in Sabadell. Of the 37 Sabadell primary schools that were contacted, 30 schools agreed to join the study. Out of all children and their families contacted at these schools (n = 3542), 1970 (56%) agreed to participate. Participating schools were similar to the remaining schools in Sabadell in terms of urban exposure levels (i.e NO2 levels [38.1 versus 39.8 μg/m3, Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.54)], except for noise levels (60.1 versus 63.0 dB(A), p = 0.02). Additionally, we included children participating in the longitudinal INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente, Environment and Childhood) Sabadell birth-cohort study. In INMA, 778 pregnant women were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy between 2004 and 2006, and were followed from then onwards. In this study, we included the INMA children who participated in the follow-up visit at age 10–12 and attended Sabadell primary schools in the 4th, 5th and 6th years (n = 481) during the same period of the ECHOCAT study. Similar protocols for data collection, outcome assessment and exposure assessment were used in ECHOCAT and INMA. In both studies, all parents or tutors/guardians signed a consent form and the studies were approved by the Clinical Research Ethical Committee of the IMIM-Parc de Salut MAR, Barcelona, Spain.

## Childhood obesity outcomes

Child anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist circumference and body fat percentage) were measured following the same standardized protocol in ECHOCAT and INMA at schools. All measurements were taken without shoes and in light clothing by specially trained personnel. Child height (nearest 0.1 cm) and weight (nearest 0.1 kg) were used to calculate age-and-sex specific BMI z-scores (zBMI, in standard deviation units) following the World Health Organization Growth Reference. Children with a zBMI higher than +1 were defined as overweight including obesity, and children below this cut off were considered normal weight, including underweight. We focused on children with overweight rather than only children with obesity because the large number of children that have excess weight and are known to be at an increased risk of multiple adverse health outcomes. Additionally, waist circumference (nearest 0.1 cm) was measured at the high point of the iliac crest and with minimal respiration using an inelastic tape (model 201; SECA, Hamburg, Germany). Percentage body fat was measured using bioelectrical impedance analyses (TANITA DC-360 and Bodystat 1500 instruments were used in ECHOCAT and INMA, respectively). For INMA we calculated body fat percentage using validated bioimpedance formulas as these are validated for the Bodystat instrument. For ECHOCAT we used the body fat percentage values directly obtained from the TANITA instrument, because the Clasey equation is not validated for this instrument. The values from the TANITA were highly correlated with the values from the Clasey equation (Pearson correlation rs = 0.94). Finally, we obtained waist circumference and body fat percentage z-scores by calculating standardized residuals from a regression model of waist circumference and body fat percentage as dependent variable, with age, sex and study.

Overall, the outcomes were highly correlated with each other, zBMI and waist circumference z-scores had a Pearson correlation of 0.86, and zBMI and body fat percentage z-scores of 0.79. Therefore, we decided to keep zBMI and overweight/obesity status (normal weight vs overweight/obesity) as our main outcome, and waist circumference and body fat percentage z-scores as sensitivity analyses. zBMI, waist circumference and bio-impedance measures are considered as markers of adiposity, intra-abdominal obesity and body composition, respectively.

## Weight-related behaviours

Weight-related behaviours including diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleeping duration were collected from parents through questionnaires. Psychological well-being was collected directly from the children. Data about dietary intake and dietary behaviours were obtained through a specific questionnaire and a modified version of a validated food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The food frequency questionnaire referred to the child intake in the previous year, and it was completed by the parents, and the responses were transformed to times/week of intake. We selected two items as indicators of unhealthy diet: fast food consumption in restaurants and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. The fast food consumption in fast food restaurants was obtained from this question “How often does your child eat fast food (eg. burger, french fries, hot dogs, pizza) in fast food restaurants?”. From the FFQ we obtained the sugar-sweetened beverage consumption. Both variables were categorised (<1 time/week, ≥1 times/week) as studies suggests that more frequent users (more than once weekly) are at higher risk. Minutes of physical activity per week were obtained through an adapted version of the Children’s Leisure Activities Study Survey (CLASS). We summed the total amount of time (in hours) of all physical activities performed in an average week. Additionally, we summed the total amount of time spent in vigorous physical activity hours/week. Since almost all activities had a metabolic equivalent of task (MET) score higher than 3, this can be considered as the total time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity. Vigorous physical activity was defined as activities with a score higher than 6 obtained from of the Butte and Ridley compendium. The physical activity variables were only obtained for the children participating in the ECHOCAT study. Sedentary behaviour was obtained from self-reported information on screen time. Total screen time (hours/week) was calculated by summing the total duration of television and computer time in hours per week. Both television and computer duration was calculated as: total television/computer time = 5 × weekday television/computer time duration + 2 × weekend television/computer time duration. Sleep duration (in hours/night) was calculated by subtracting the time the child woke up with the time the child went to bed and actually turned off the light during weekdays. Psychological well-being was obtained through the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire that evaluates the health-related quality of life. KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire consists of 27 items related to physical well-being (5-item), psychological well-being (7-item), autonomy and parent relations (7-item), social support and peers (4-item), and school environment (4-item). We calculated the total score following the KIDSCREEN protocol, by summing up all item responses (certain items were reversed according to the protocol). Lower values indicated poorer health-related quality of life.

## Exposure assessment: the urban environment

A wide range of urban environment exposures were estimated using geographic information system (GIS) platforms, using protocols developed for the HELIX project. We estimated the urban environment in the following exposure groups: ambient air pollution, green spaces, built environment, food environment, road traffic, and road traffic noise. Data sources and time points are specified in Table 1. The exposures were estimated at the geocoded residential address of the children and were averaged over the year before the clinical examination. The assessment of ambient air pollution included nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm (PM10) and of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), PM between 2.5 μm and 10 μm (PMcoarse), and absorbance of PM2.5 (PMabs) filters. We based the air pollution exposure assessments on the land-use regression (LUR) modelling approach developed in the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) framework. Following the ESCAPE guidelines, we applied temporal adjustment for the exposure level to each pollutant by combining the LUR spatial estimates at the geocoded address of the child and data obtained from the background routine monitoring stations in Sabadell. Specifically, we used the ratio of the concentration of the background monitor of each day of the study period and the annual average during 2009 (year of sampling campaign). We used the Catalunya model that (R2) 62–76% of the annual variation levels of the air pollutants in 2009. For green spaces, we included green space availability and accessibility indicators. We followed the Positive health Effects of the Natural Outdoor Environment in Typical Populations in Different Regions in Europe (PHENOTYPE) study to estimate the surrounding greenness (trees, shrubs, and parks) with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We obtained satellite data derived from the Landsat 4–5 Thematic Mapper (TM) with 30 m × 30 m resolution. We selected images of 2017 according to the following criteria: i) cloud cover less than 10%, ii) Standard Terrain Correction (Level 1 T) and iii) greenest period of the year (May-August). We estimated surrounding greenness within 100-m, 300-m, and 500-m buffers around each address. Additionally, we calculated the distance to the nearest major green spaces and the area of this space, considered as open areas more than 5000 m2. Finally, we created a dichotomous variable to evaluate whether a major green space was available or not within a buffer of 300 m (approximately within 15 min’ walk for children). We calculated multiple built environmental factors from topological maps obtained from the municipality of Sabadell or from Europe-wide sources including NAVTEQ and Urban Atlas. Population density was calculated as the number of inhabitants per square kilometres surrounding the children’s home address (from 100 m × 100 m raster). Connectivity density was calculated as the number of street intersections inside 100-m and 300-m buffers, divided by the area (km2) of each buffer. Two facility indexes were calculated: a) facility density was calculated as the number of facilities present divided by the area of the 300-m buffer: and b) Facility richness index was calculated as the number of different facilities types present divided by the maximum potential number of facility types specified, in a buffer of 300-m, giving a score of 0 to 1. Facilities included businesses, community services, educational institutions, entertainment, financial institutions, hospitals, parks and recreation, restaurants, shopping, and transport. Land use mix was obtained through the Shannon’s Evenness Index (SEI). SEI was calculated by multiplying each proportion of land use type by its logarithm and dividing the sum of all land use type products by the logarithm of the total possible land use types within 300-m buffer. We developed an indicator of walkability, adapted from previous walkability indices, calculated as the mean of the deciles of population density, connectivity density, facility richness index, and land use SEI within 300-m buffers, giving a walkability score ranging from 0 to 1. The accessibility of public transportation was measured by public bus transport lines and the amount of bus stops inside 100-m, 300-m, and 500-m buffers, divided by the buffer area. Table 1

* The following exposures were categorized below and above the median because they did not achieve normality for imputation: straight line distance to a green space, area of the nearest green space, population density, bus stops (100 m, 300 m and 500 m buffer). Road traffic load in the nearest major road was categorized in three categories (0-values equal to 0, 1-below the median, 2-above the median).

We created an unhealthy food environment index based on the NAVTEQ database. This indicator equals the number of unhealthy facilities present divided by the area of the 300-m buffer (number of facilities/km2). Among the 100 different subcategories of facilities in the NAVTEQ database we selected the subcategories related to unhealthy food (petrol/gasoline Station, bar or pub, coffee shop, restaurant, convenience store, shopping malls). Higher values indicate more availability of different unhealthy facilities.
Road traffic indicators were calculated from traffic road network maps following the ESCAPE protocol. We estimated the following indicators: traffic load on all roads, traffic load on the major road within 100 m, traffic density on nearest road, and inverse distance to nearest major road.
Road traffic noise levels were derived from noise maps produced in each local municipality (including Sabadell) under the European Noise Directive. We obtained two road traffic noise variables: a) Lden was calculated as the annual average sound pressure level of a 24-h periods (day, evening, night); and b) Ln was calculated as the annual average sound pressure level of the night period.

2.5. Covariates

Information on parental sociodemographic factors were collected by children’s parents through questionnaires. Covariate information included parental education (primary education or lower, secondary education, university education or higher), occupation (employed, others), country of birth (both parents native, none or one native parents), maternal household economy (living comfortably, doing alright, just about getting by, finding it quite/very difficult), maternal smoking status (non-smoker, ex-smoker, smoker), maternal BMI (kg/m2), and the number of siblings (no siblings, 1 sibling, ≥2 siblings). Additionally, we estimated a deprivation index to account for area-level SES. The deprivation index was estimated at census track and was based on 5 socioeconomic indicators: % of unemployed population, % of unemployed youth population, % of eventual employment, % of unqualified employed persons and % of population without studies. The deprivation index was stratified in quintiles based on the Spanish population, where the lowest quintiles are the children living in the less deprived areas. Data was obtained from the Spanish Statistical office of 2001.

2.6. Statistical analyses

2.6.1. Multiple imputations
Before imputation of missing values, we transformed all skewed exposures, weight-related behaviours and covariate variables to achieve normality; variables were categorized if normality was not achieved. We applied chained equations to impute all exposures, weight-related behaviours and covariate missing values. Physical activity was imputed for the whole INMA study sample. We imputed 20 datasets and we restricted the number of predictors in the imputation models to fewer than 25 variables while ensuring that all outcomes were considered as predictors. After imputation, we standardized all continuous exposure variables by the interquartile range (IQR). The following exposures were categorized below and above the median because they did not achieve normality for imputation: straight line distance to a green space, area of the nearest green space, population density, bus stops (100 m, 300 m and 500 m buffer). Traffic load in the nearest major road was categorized in three categories (values equal to 0, below and above the median). We further categorized the well-being outcome for imputation; we created a dichotomous variable with children below and above the median KIDSCREEN score (poorer vs. better well-being). In the analyses described below, results from each imputed dataset were combined using Rubin’s rules.

2.6.2. Statistical models
For descriptive purposes, we first explored the associations between weight-related behaviours (fast food consumption in restaurants, sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, total and vigorous physical activity duration, screen time, sleep duration and psychological well-being) with the dichotomous outcome overweight/obesity status (normal weight vs. 2.6.3. Single exposure analysis
We applied an ExWAS analyses to screen all possible individual exposure-outcome associations. This model relies on independent regression models to estimate the association between each exposure variable with each outcome, adjusting for potential confounders. We corrected the p-values thresholds to account for multiple hypothesis testing using a family-wise error rate correction (5% divided by the effective number of tests). The multiple testing corrected p-value threshold was 0.003.

2.6.4. Multiple exposure models
We applied multiple exposure models to evaluate the stability of the exposure-health associations by assessing possible confounding between the urban exposures. We selected one indicator within each exposure group which are the most common indicators in the literature: NO2 (air pollution), NDVI + 300 m (green spaces), land use mix (built environment), unhealthy food environment, traffic density, and Lden (road traffic noise). Further, we added any other exposure that was significant at the p-value 0.05 level in the single exposure analysis. We selected the confounders for each urban exposure individually in the directed acyclic graphs (DAG). In this DAG, green spaces, built environment factors, food environment, and road traffic are part of the urban design and may determine the levels of air pollution and road traffic noise in the city, and may thus be on the causal pathway between the urban design indicators and childhood obesity outcomes. Hence, the urban design indicators can be considered mutual confounders between each other, and are considered confounders between air pollution, road traffic noise and the childhood obesity outcomes and weight-related behaviours. Air pollution and road traffic noise are also considered as mutual confounders. In addition to our DAG-based multiple exposure models, we also constructed one model with all exposures together, recognising that the DAGs may be based on unverifiable assumptions.

2.6.5. Hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC)
We applied a HCPC analyses to classify children into clusters with similar urban exposures patterns. We performed the HCPC analyses on a reduced exposure dataset including only the continuous exposure variables (N = 20). Previously, a study in Sabadell found that children from higher area-level SES were associated with higher levels of air pollution, noise, traffic, and lower levels of green spaces. Thus, SES may play an important role in the association between the urban exposure patterns and childhood obesity outcomes and weight-related behaviours. We therefore standardized all exposure variables by the mean within each quintile of the deprivation index before running the HCPC; Thus, the standardized exposures explore gradients in the particular exposure among individuals with a similar deprivation index.
We applied first a principal component analyses (PCA) to reduce the dimension of the data and selected the number of components that explained at least 80% of the variance in the data. We then applied an ascending hierarchical classification (AHC) to identify clusters of exposure based on the components obtained from the PCA. We applied AHC after the PCA, rather than directly to the original dataset, because the PCA removes noise in the data and results in more stable clustering analysis. We selected the numbers of clusters by applying the Ward’s criterion based on the decomposition of the total inertia (i.e., total variance) in between- and within-group variance. The Ward’s method consists in aggregating two clusters such that the growth of the within-inertia, characterizing the homogeneity of a cluster, is minimum. The identified clusters were used in the regression models as an independent variable.

2.6.6. Confounder selection
All above models were adjusted for a common set of confounders. We selected the potential confounders based on the DAG to minimize overadjustment bias. The following variables were identified: study design, parental education, paternal occupation, and parental country of birth, maternal household economy, maternal smoking status, maternal BMI, the number of siblings, and area-level SES.

2.6.7. Sensitivity analyses
We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our results based on our single exposure models: (a) in order to evaluate the role of SES in the associations between urban exposures and zBMI, we evaluated how the removal of individual- and area-level SES variables affected the main effect estimates; (b) to evaluate the effect of standardizing the urban exposures by SES, we evaluated the associations between the standardized continuous exposures and zBMI; and, (c) the models with zBMI as an outcome were additionally adjusted for physical activity and diet consumption, whereas the models with weight-related behaviours as outcome were adjusted for zBMI. We did not include these in the main models as they may act as mediators of some exposures rather than as confounders. (d) As children spend a large amount of time at schools, we evaluated the associations between the urban exposures estimated at the schools and zBMI. The exposures at schools were only available for the ECHOCAT children. (e) Gender differences may exist in the use of the urban environment and in weight-related behaviours; we evaluated the effect modification of sex by introducing an interaction term into the model and evaluating the p-value for interaction with the likelihood ratio test. For this sensitivity analysis, we applied single exposure associations selecting one urban indicator within each exposure group. (f) to evaluate the quality of the imputation, we compared the distribution of the covariates in the imputed and non-imputed dataset, and we repeated the single exposure analyses using zBMI as an outcome only in the complete case dataset.

3. Results

3.1. Study population
The study population included 2213 children, 1732 (78.3%) from ECHOCAT and 481 (21.7%) from INMA. Children from both studies had similar overweight and obesity levels, and showed similar weight-related behaviours. The INMA study included more boys, children that were slightly older, and parents with slightly lower SES levels, than the ECHOCAT study. The children from both studies were on average 10.8 years old at baseline and 52.1% were girls. The prevalence of overweight including obesity was 39.9%. Boys were more likely to have overweight/obesity than girls (42.2% vs. Table 2 (continued )

Values are mean (Standard deviation (SD)) for continuous normal distributed variables, median (interquartile range) for continuous non-normal distributed variables, and percentage for categorical variables. Logistic regression was assessed individually for each variable adjusting by study design, sex, age, maternal education and area-level SES.

36.9%. Further, we observed that higher consumption to fast food restaurants and increased levels of screen time were associated with a higher odds of overweight or obesity (odds ratio (OR) [high vs. low fast food in restaurants consumption] = 1.43, [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.89]; OR [for each 1 h/week increase in screen time] = 1.02, [95 %CI: 1.01, 1.03]). Increased sleep duration during weekdays and better well-being were associated with a lower odds of overweight or obesity (OR [for each 1 h/day increase in sleep duration during weekdays] = 0.81, [95 %CI: 0.70, 0.93]; OR (better vs. poorer well-being) = 0.72, [95 %CI: 0.60, 0.85]). Higher maternal BMI, and lower parental individual and area level SES were associated with higher levels of overweight/obesity.

3.2. Exposure levels and distributions

Distributions of the urban exposures are shown in Table S2. We observed a clear gradient in the distribution of the urban exposures across the area-level SES quintiles (Table S2). In comparison with children living in the least deprived area, children living in the most deprived area were exposed to lower levels of air pollution, facility density, traffic load and road traffic noise, and to higher levels of green spaces, connectivity within 100-m, and land use mix. Pearson correlations (r) of all continuous environmental factors are shown in Figure S6. Air pollution exposures were negatively correlated with green spaces exposures (rs ranging from 0.4 to 0.7) and positively with most built environmental factors (rs = 0.0 to +0.4), unhealthy food environment (rs = +0.2 to +0.3), road traffic indicators (rs = +0.0 to 0.5), and road traffic noise (rs = +0.3 to +0.5). Green spaces exposures were negatively correlated with built environmental factors (rs = 0.0 to 0.6), food environment (rs = 0.3 to 0.4), road traffic indicators (rs = 0.0 to 0.2) and road traffic noise (rs = 0.1 to 0.2). Overall, built environmental factors showed weak or moderate positive correlations with each other, and positively correlations with unhealthy food environment (rs = +0.2 to +0.4). Road traffic indicators was positively correlated with road traffic noise levels (rs = +0.0 to +0.4).

3.3. Single and multiple exposure associations with childhood obesity outcomes

In single exposure models, only PMcoarse was associated with an increase in child zBMI score at a p < 0.05 level (beta (β) = 0.05 per 1.8 μg/m3 increase in PMcoarse; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.10), but this association did not pass the multiple testing corrected p-value threshold of 0.003. There were some tendencies for proximity and size of green spaces and higher density of bus stops in 500 m to be associated with lower zBMI (β (proximity green spaces) = 0.04, [95% CI: 0.14, 0.06]; β (size green spaces) = 0.07, [95% CI: 0.17, 0.03]; β (bus stops + 500 m) = 0.07, [95% CI: 0.17, 0.03];) and the different air pollutants, unhealthy food environment and road traffic noise with higher zBMI [(β (PM10) = 0.03, [95% CI: 0.02, 0.09]; (β (food environment) = 0.04, [95% CI: 0.04, 0.11]; β (Lden) = 0.06, [95% CI: 0.00, 0.12])], but none passed the 0.05 p-value. We did not observe a clear trend for NDVI, built environment factors and road traffic. Similar findings were obtained using the dichotomous overweight/obesity status variable, and for waist circumference and body fat percentage z-score.

In the multiple exposure models, we observed that the effect estimates for zBMI and overweight/obesity status remained mostly similar after adjusting by other urban exposures. PMcoarse remained associated with zBMI after adjusting for multiple exposures (beta (β) = 0.06 per 1.8 μg/m3 increase in PMcoarse; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.12). Notable, the associations between land use mix and unhealthy food environment and overweight/obesity status became stronger and statistically significant at a p-value level of 0.05 (0.2 units increase of land use mix (OR) = 1.30 [95% CI: 1.01; 1.69]; and 17.7 facilities/km2 increase of unhealthy food environment (OR) = 1.20 [95% CI: 1.01; 1.44]). Unhealthy food environment also showed associations with waist circumference z-scores (β = 0.09 [95% CI: 0.01; 0.17]) and zBMI (borderline statistical significance; β = 0.09 [95% CI: 0.01; 0.18]) in the multiple exposure models. Estimates from models evaluating all exposures together were essentially the same as those from the multiple exposure models.

3.4. Single and multiple exposure associations with weight-related behaviours

None of the associations between urban exposures and weight-related behaviours were statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. However, some associations were observed at p < 0.05 level related with sugar-sweetened beverage consumption: greater density of bus stops and traffic on major roads were associated with a higher odds of drinking sugar-sweetened beverages, and NDVI with a lower odds. In the multiple exposure models, the effect estimates of the weight-related behaviours remained mostly similar to those in the single exposure analyses. However, some associations became statistically significant at a p-value level of 0.05: land use mix was associated with an increase in screen time use (β = 1.25 h/wk; 95% CI: 0.22, 2.27), and NO2 exposure was associated with poorer well-being (OR = 0.82, [95% CI: 0.70, 0.96]). Full multiple exposure models including all exposures together were essentially the same as those from the multiple exposure models.

3.5. Cluster analyses

After standardizing the urban exposures by area-level SES, we obtained 5 different patterns of the urban environment in the cluster analyses. Cluster 1 represented very high levels of green spaces and lower levels of air pollution, built environment characteristics, road traffic and road traffic noise levels. Cluster 2 was similar to cluster 1, but the exposure levels were closer to the overall mean. Cluster 3 represented approximately the overall mean of all the exposures and was considered as our reference category. In figure S11, we specified the deviation of each urban exposure concentration level compared with cluster 3. Cluster 4 represented higher levels of built environmental factors such as facility density and unhealthy food density. Finally, cluster 5 represented very high levels of air pollution, road traffic and # Environment International 155 (2021) 106700

Fig. 1. Association between the urban environment and childhood obesity outcomes in single-exposure ExWAS model (N = 2213). Beta estimates and ORs for all exposures are shown in Table S3. Note: beta coefficient for change in zBMI and OR for overweight/obesity status is compared with reference category (normal weight) for the categorical variables. For continuous variables, beta estimates and OR are calculated per interquartile range increase in exposure. Models were adjusted by study design, maternal and paternal education, paternal occupation, occupation, and parental country of birth, maternal household economy, maternal smoking status, maternal BMI, the number of siblings, and area-level SES.

road traffic noise. Both cluster 4 and 5 had slightly lower levels of green spaces than cluster 1 and 2 but similar to cluster 3. We observed that cluster 5 was associated with higher zBMI and higher odds of overweight or obesity (β = 0.17, [95% CI: 0.01, 0.34]; OR (borderline statistical significance overweight/obesity vs. normal weight) = 1.36, [95% CI: 0.99, 1.85]), in comparison with cluster 3 (Table 3). We did not observe any significant associations between the different clusters and the weight-related behaviours (Table 3)

## Sensitivity analyses
The effects estimates changed substantially after adjusting for SES variables, especially when we added area-level SES in the models (Table S5). We further observed that standardizing or adjusting by area-level SES did not change the results of the single exposure analyses (Table S6). Finally, we observed no changes in the effect estimates for zBMI after adjusting by diet (fast food and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption) or physical activity (Table S7), nor did we observe changes in the effect estimates of the weight-related behaviours after adjusting by zBMI (results not shown). Most of the effect estimates between the urban exposures estimated around schools and zBMI in the ECHOCAT children remained similar in direction as in the main analyses, with the exception of a higher level of connectivity around schools associated with a lower zBMI (Table S8). Child sex did not modify the associations between the multiple urban exposures and childhood obesity outcomes and weight-related behaviours (Table S9). We observed similar distribution of the covariates in the non-imputed and imputed dataset (Table S10), and in the complete case-analyses the associations did not change notably (Table S11).

## Discussion
In this study we evaluated systematically the associations between multiple urban exposures and childhood obesity outcomes and weight-related behaviours. We found weight-related behaviours, such as consumption of fast food in restaurants, screen-time, and sleep duration, to be associated with childhood overweight/obesity. In single and multiple exposure models there were few associations between urban environment exposures and the obesity outcomes or the weight-related behaviours.

Fig. 2. Associations between urban environment and childhood obesity outcomes in multiple exposure models (N = 2213). Beta estimates for change in zBMI, waist circumference and body fat (%) z-scores, and OR for overweight/obesity status are compared with reference category (normal weight) for the categorical variables. The beta estimates and OR are calculated per interquartile range increase in exposure. Abbreviations: Lden, annual average of day, evening and night noise levels; NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; NO2, nitrogen dioxide; age-and-sex body mass index z-score, zBMI. Multiple exposure models for NO2, PMcoarse and Lden were adjusted for NO, NDVI, land use mix, unhealthy food environment, road traffic density, Lden, design, maternal and paternal education, paternal occupation, occupation, and parental country of birth, maternal household economy, maternal smoking status, maternal BMI, the number of siblings, and area-level SES. Multiple exposure models for NDVI + 300 m, land use mix, unhealthy food environment and traffic density were adjusted for NDVI, land use mix, unhealthy food environment, road traffic density, design, maternal and paternal education, paternal occupation, occupation, and parental country of birth, maternal household economy, maternal smoking status, maternal BMI, the number of siblings, and area-level SES. Full multiple exposure model (including all exposures simultaneously): NO2 or PMcoarse, NDVI, land use mix, unhealthy food environment, road traffic density, Lden, design, maternal and paternal education, paternal occupation, occupation, and parental country of birth, maternal household economy, maternal smoking status, maternal BMI, the number of siblings, and area-level SES.

higher zBMI in the single exposure model (which did not pass the cluster analysis and to previous studies. We found little evidence of associations between green space exposure variables and zBMI, whereas the literature shows largely inconclusive results. In single and multiple exposure models we may not have had enough power to detect single associations. Further, when we address each exposure in isolation we may actually capture other aspects of the urban environment; for example, it is not clear how much of the association of air pollution might be due to the actual air pollution concentration, or due to the effect of other highly correlated exposures. This may be overcome to some extent by the multiple exposure models (various exposures in one model), but in these models only a limited number of not too highly correlated exposures can be included due to co-linearity problems. In our multiple exposure models the associations between land use mix and unhealthy food environment and overweight/obesity status became stronger and statistically significant. This indicates that these associations were influenced by confounding effects of the other urban exposures. In fact, not adjusting for other urban exposures may have obscured true effects in previous studies. By applying the cluster analysis, we are more likely to capture the urban environment as a whole, which may be another powerful way to examine multiple urban Cluster        Cluster 2      Cluster 3

Mean exposures with health. The fact that we only observe associations in cluster 5 and not in cluster 1 and 4 could be because the combination of exposures may neutralize the positive or negative effect of the individual exposures in the single and multiple exposure models. In addition, cluster 5, which has consistently higher levels of air pollution, road traffic and road traffic noise, and not many neutralizing exposures (average concentrations of green spaces and built environment factors), we actually observe an association with zBMI. A limitation of the cluster analysis is that it does not identify which of the exposures in each cluster are more likely to impact on childhood obesity. Overall, the results of the different models are important from a policy maker point of view, because long-term solutions to the childhood obesity epidemic may be achieved by modifying some specific aspects of the urban environment, and our results indicate that these should be focused on reducing levels of air pollution, road traffic and road traffic noise.

The mechanisms underlying the effects of the multiple urban exposures and childhood obesity are still poorly understood. Experimental studies in mice have found that air pollution may interfere with obesity pathogenesis at a molecular level inducing inflammation/oxidative stress, hormone disruption, and visceral adiposity. Noise could influence sleep deprivation and increase stress hormones, which are associated with physical development in childhood, increasing the risk of overweight in children. Increased access to unhealthy food environment may increase the consumption of fast-food consumption and increase caloric intake which is a known risk factor of childhood obesity. Finally, contrary to what we expected, we observed that increased levels of land use mix were associated with increased levels of childhood obesity in the multiple exposure models. Our exposure assessment may not have captured well the different land uses in more densely populated areas, as these were categorized only as residential areas. It is only in the outskirts of the city that we found more diverse land uses, but these areas are more deprived and with less access to facilities, which may explain why we observed increased risk of childhood obesity.

4.2.   Weight-related behaviours

It is well-known that weight-related behaviours have an important impact on the development of childhood obesity. We observed that higher consumption to fast food restaurants and more screen time were associated with higher odds of overweight and obesity, whereas longer sleep duration during weekdays and better well-being were associated with lower odds of overweight and obesity. Childhood obesity is a direct consequence of a chronic imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure. Thus, increased consumption of fast food may contribute to increased caloric intake. Increased screen time may influence on a reduction of the energy expenditure creating a positive energy balance and increase weight gain. Short sleep duration has been associated with obesity in children. This association may be explained through multiple pathways including decrease of energy expenditure, increase appetite, and hormonal and neuroendocrine changes that would cause weight gain. Most of the pathways between poor mental health and obesity may go through increased appetite, and less time spent for physical activity.

We did not observe consistent associations between the urban exposures and weight-related behaviours. There are several possible explanations for this. The weight-related behaviours were self-reported by the parents, which could have introduced misclassification and recall bias. However, we did observe associations in the expected direction between the weight-related behaviours and overweight/obesity status, which makes it less likely that recall bias explains the lack of association. A more likely explanation is that the assessment of the behaviours in our study may not be context-specific in the urban environment where the behaviour occurs. The sole presence of green spaces and unhealthy food facilities does not necessarily imply increased physical activity or high fat caloric diet consumption, respectively. For example, green spaces and built environmental factors may increase physical activity and reduce levels of obesity through active commuting and recreational walking, and not through the leisure sport activities that were reported.

The beta estimates and OR for childhood obesity outcomes and weight related behaviours are compared with the reference category cluster 3 (N = 610 [27.6%]). Models were adjusted by study design, maternal and paternal education, paternal occupation, occupation, and parental country of birth, maternal household economy, maternal smoking status, maternal BMI, the number of siblings and area-level SES.

in our questionnaire. Future studies, incorporating more detailed questions on context-specific behaviours and real-time monitoring (e.g. of physical activity through accelerometers), would be needed to disentangle this. Furthermore, our main analysis focused on exposures at the residential address whereas other urban settings such as the school environment or the daily travel patterns are likely to have an impact on weight-related behaviours in children. However, our sensitivity analyses showed very similar associations with zBMI when using school instead of home exposures. Finally, for some combinations of exposures and weight-related behaviours there may not be much previous evidence of a direct associations. However, rather than omitting some of these combinations from our analyses, we chose to show all results as an exploratory, or “screening” analysis in the single exposure models, also because all these exposures were used to build the clusters.

Socioeconomic status plays an important role in the associations between the urban environment and childhood obesity outcomes. In this study, children living in more deprived areas had higher rates of overweight and obesity, and were exposed to lower levels of air pollution, road traffic, road traffic noise and higher levels of green spaces. In Spain, lower SES areas have been consistently associated with increased levels of childhood obesity, but the role of SES in urban environment studies is not clear and likely to vary by location. In the US, people living in deprived areas have been reported to be exposed to higher levels of air pollution, whereas in European settings this is less consistent, showing that environmental inequality may not always be negative in direction. A recent study, including 9 urban areas from 6 existing birth-cohort studies across Europe, including INMA Sabadell, reported that the association between SES and urban exposures varied between locations, with some showing more harmful exposures in lower and other in higher SES classes (both at individual and area level). In our study setting it seems that families with high SES prioritize living closer to the city centre of the urban area with higher levels of air pollution and less green spaces, rather than choosing to live in more environmentally “healthier” areas. Thus, the confounding effect by SES in the associations between the urban environment and weight-related outcomes was a special concern in our study. Therefore, we included many individual-level and area-level SES variables to minimize the potential impact of confounding by SES. Our sensitivity analysis showed that especially area SES had a large impact on effect estimates, and thus it is indeed important to adjust at both levels in these types of studies. However, we cannot fully rule out residual socioeconomic confounding, as SES is a complex construct and there may be components that are not captured in our variables. In the hierarchical clustering on principal components analysis we used SES standardised exposures. This avoided both the influence of the units of measurements and the variance by SES, and minimized residual confounding by SES.

Strengths and limitations
This study has a number of strengths. First, we included multiple exposures in the urban environment, examined different childhood obesity outcomes (BMI, waist circumference and body fat percentage) and multiple behaviours (diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep and well-being), allowing a comprehensive assessment of many weight-related outcomes. Second, we applied a statistical approach with three complementary steps that has several advantages in comparison with previous studies: (i) in the single exposure analyses we corrected the p-value for multiple testing which reduce false-positive results; (ii) in the multiple and all exposure models we accounted for confounding between urban exposures which are highly correlated; (iii) in the cluster analyses we evaluated urban exposure patterns that may have an impact on childhood obesity risk and weight-related behaviours.
As a limitation, our cross-sectional design may have limited causal inference between the urban exposures and childhood obesity and weight-related behaviours. This is especially a concern for the interpretation of the associations between weight-related behaviours and the odds of overweight and obesity, whereby the obesity status may have influenced in the change of the child behaviour (e.g. children with obesity may sleep less or have poorer mental health than normal weight children). We expect that reverse causality is less of a concern for the associations between urban exposures and obesity, as obesity status is unlikely to have influenced these exposures. However, as mentioned before, residential self-selection may have influenced our results as children with higher obesity levels (from lower SES areas) are more likely to live in less polluted and greener areas, which may have underestimated the association between urban exposures and childhood obesity. Studies with longitudinal follow-up are required to shed light on this. In addition, we were able to include many exposures related to the urban environment, but we could not include all and did not cover factors such as light at night, type and quality of green spaces, and blue spaces. Lastly, our study population was somewhat selective: schools that participated were more likely to be from less deprived areas than schools that did not. and 2nd quintiles of deprivation, for the excluded schools this is 50%),
and within participating school’s children of lower socio-economic
status may have been less likely to participate. This may have limited
the generalisability of our results. However, as we observed similar
childhood obesity levels in ECHOCAT, INMA and previous published
studies in Catalonia, we consider that the sample
is representative of the levels of childhood obesity in Catalonia, and
further complex survey designs and sample weights were not applied.

## Conclusion

This systematic study of many exposures in the urban environment
suggests that an exposure pattern characterised by higher levels of
ambient air pollution, road traffic and road traffic noise is associated
with increased childhood obesity risk, and that PMcoarse, land use mix
and food environment are separately associated with obesity risk. These
findings require follow-up in longitudinal studies and different settings.
