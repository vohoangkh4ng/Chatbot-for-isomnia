# Title: Neighborhood disadvantage is associated with actigraphy-assessed sleep continuity and short sleep duration

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and sleep quality among predominantly African American adults living in low-income areas. It utilizes objective measures of sleep through actigraphy, examining how perceived neighborhood safety and actual crime levels impact sleep duration, efficiency, and wakefulness after sleep onset. The findings indicate that greater perceived safety correlates with better sleep outcomes, while higher crime rates are linked to poorer sleep efficiency and longer wakefulness after sleep onset. The research highlights the potential role of neighborhood conditions in contributing to sleep health disparities.
