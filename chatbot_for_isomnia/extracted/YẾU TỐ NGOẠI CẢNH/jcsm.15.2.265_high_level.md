# Title: The Moderating Role of Parents’ Dysfunctional Sleep-Related Beliefs Among Associations Between Adolescents’ Pre-Bedtime Conflict, Sleep Quality, and Their Mental Health

## Summary: This study investigates the indirect effects of parent-child conflicts over bedtime on adolescents' mental health, specifically anxiety and depression, through the mediating role of sleep quality. It highlights how parents' dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs can moderate this relationship, suggesting that in families where parents exhibit higher levels of dysfunctional beliefs, the negative impact of bedtime conflicts on adolescents' sleep and mental health is more pronounced. The findings underscore the importance of addressing parental beliefs about sleep to mitigate risks associated with adolescent sleep problems and mental health issues.
