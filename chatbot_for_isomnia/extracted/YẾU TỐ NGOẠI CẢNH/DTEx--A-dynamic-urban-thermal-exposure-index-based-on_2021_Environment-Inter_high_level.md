# Title: DTEx: A dynamic urban thermal exposure index based on human mobility patterns

## Summary: This article introduces the Dynamic Urban Thermal Exposure index (DTEx), a novel tool designed to assess heat exposure in urban environments by incorporating human mobility patterns. The DTEx utilizes large-scale, anonymized smartphone location data alongside machine learning models that analyze air temperature data from vehicle-mounted sensors. The index reveals varying levels of thermal exposure, identifying high-temperature areas linked to foot traffic, particularly around shopping plazas and event venues. The findings emphasize the importance of dynamic heat monitoring for urban planning and risk communication, aiming to enhance heat mitigation strategies in vulnerable urban locations.
