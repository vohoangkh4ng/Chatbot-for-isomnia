# Title: Association between long-term exposure to air pollution and sleep disorder in Chinese children: the Seven Northeastern Cities study

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and sleep disorders in Chinese children. Conducted with a sample of 59,754 children aged 2â€“17 from seven northeastern cities, the research found that exposure to various air pollutants, particularly PM1 and PM2.5, is associated with increased odds of sleep disorders. The findings highlight a stronger association in female children and emphasize the need for public health initiatives aimed at reducing air pollution exposure to mitigate sleep-related issues in children.
