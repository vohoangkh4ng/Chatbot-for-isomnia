# Title: Early childhood exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with increased risk of paediatric asthma: An administrative cohort study from Stockholm, Sweden

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between early childhood exposure to various air pollutants and the risk of developing asthma. Using data from singleton births in the greater Stockholm area, the research focuses on exposure during critical early life periods and examines the influence of socio-economic status (SES) on asthma risk. The findings indicate that exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5), primary organic carbon (pOC), and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) during the first three years of life is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma, particularly in lower SES areas. The study highlights the importance of environmental factors in asthma aetiology and suggests that children from disadvantaged backgrounds may be more vulnerable to air pollution-related asthma.
