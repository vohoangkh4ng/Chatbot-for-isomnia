**Backgrounds:** While the pernicious effects of outdoor air pollution on cognitive ability have been previously examined, evidence regarding household air pollution is scarce.
**Methods:** Using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, we explored the relationship between cooking with biomass fuel and cognitive impairment and cognitive decline using a Cox proportional hazards model. We further assessed the correlation of biomass fuels and cognitive score using a generalized estimating equation. Cognitive ability was measured based on the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and cognitive impairment was defined as MMSE < 24 points and cognitive decline was defined as a reduction of MMSE ≥ 3 points. On follow-up, we investigated the effect of switch-cooking combustibles on cognitive ability.
**Results:** The mean (SD) age of 4161 participants was 81.7 (10.0) years old. The reported cooking with biomass fuels was correlated with an elevated risk of cognitive impairment (hazard ratio (HR): 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.37) and cognitive decline (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.33). Besides, cooking with biomass fuels was related to a decrease in cognitive score (β: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.14). In comparison to persistent biomass fuel users, participants who reported changing their primary cooking fuels from biomass to clean fuels exhibited a reduced risk of cognitive impairment (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.82) and cognitive decline (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.76) and a higher cognitive score (β: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.17, 1.26). Cooking without ventilated cookstoves was associated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.58) and cognitive decline (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.38), regardless of types of cooking fuels. Interaction and stratified analyses showed relatively poor cognitive ability in participants who engaged in irregular exercise or were not living with family members.
**Conclusions:** Cooking with biomass fuels was correlated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment and cognitive decline. Among the oldest-old population, this risk may, however, be lower for those changing their primary cooking fuels from biomass to clean fuels.

## 1. Introduction

Currently, China contributes to about one fifth of the world’s total population, however, due to a drastic decline in mortality and birth rates, China is rapidly transforming into an aging country. Indeed, it is predicted that from 2010 to 2050, the elderly Chinese population, aged 65 and over, will rise from 111 million to 400 million. Among them, it is predicted that individuals eighty years of age and above will experience explosive growth from 19.3 million to 150 million. This rapid increase entails that China will have one of the highest proportions of elderly persons in the world
Notably, an aging population with longer life expectancy will undoubtedly result in a series of health challenges. Consequently, more considerable attention should be paid to age-related diseases. Research indicates that cognitive functioning decreases with age, and older adults are disproportionately affected by cognitive impairment. The proportion of elderly people exhibiting normal cognitive functioning sharply declines with age. In China, the reported regional prevalence of mild cognitive impairment previously ranged from 5.4% to 25.0%. There is no doubt that as demographics evolve to include a greater proportion of older adults, particularly the oldest-old population, the prevalence of cognitive impairment will continue to rise.
Many psychosocial, economic, and biological factors (e.g., lifestyle, personality traits, physical health status) are correlated with cognitive impairment. In recent years, epidemiologic evidence indicates that environmental risk factors such as air pollution may impair the cognitive ability amongst older adults. Nevertheless, most current researches concerned the impact of outdoor air pollution on cognitive ability; only a handful of studies, however, to date have evaluated the association between biomass fuel use and cognitive ability. The association of biomass fuels and cognitive impairment and cognitive decline is less well-understood in high-risk populations, such as older adults.
Though efforts have been made to decrease household air pollution, it remains a crucial public health concern, which cannot be ignored in low and middle-income countries, including China. Notably, household air pollution is yearly linked to about 2.6 million untimely deaths and the third leading risk factor for death worldwide. The WHO estimates that nearly three billion people worldwide rely on biomass fuels to meet daily cooking needs as they lack access to clean cooking facilities. When used for cooking indoors, biomass fuels (e.g., wood, charcoal, dung) produce large amounts of air pollutants and increase fine particulate matter (PM) exposure. In China, given the number of older population persistent increase and the widespread use of biomass fuels, identifying a possible link of household air pollution from using biomass fuels and cognitive ability is an essential issue for decreasing the public health burden correlated with cognitive impairment and cognitive decline.
The Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) is a prospective long-term national cohort study that provides data on the quality of life and the health status of older adults ≥ 65 years of age. In over-sampling the oldest-old, the CLHLS includes a much broader population of adults ≥ 80 years of age, a stage of aging that is particularly prone to a cognitive decline. Therefore, the CLHLS study provides the opportunity to examine factors associated with cognitive ability in the oldest-old more comprehensively. Thus, in the present study, we assess the association between cooking with biomass fuel and the risk of cognitive impairment and cognitive decline using data from the CLHLS. Besides, we also examined if an improvement or worsening of one’s household environment due to a change in cooking fuels are related to changes in their cognitive ability.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Study design and participants

The CLHLS study was established in 1998 and is conducted in twenty-two of thirty-one provinces in China. The face-to-face follow-up surveys were conducted in 2000 (second wave), 2002 (third wave), 2005 (fourth wave), 2008/2009 (fifth wave), 2011/2012 (sixth wave), 2014 (seventh wave) and 2017/2018 (eighth wave), respectively. Due to the lack of information on the use of cooking fuels during the initial data collection phase (first to the fifth wave), this study only included collected CLHLS data for the year 2011/2012 (sixth wave) at baseline. During the 2011/2012 wave, the following question was asked: “Which fuels are normally used for cooking in your home?”. This wave was expanded to twenty-three provinces after including Chengmai City in Hainan Province, and a follow-up survey was carried out in the year 2014 and 2017/2018.
The sixth wave (data collected in 2011/2012) included 9765 Chinese elderly adults. For the present study, exclusion criteria were (i) age (<65 years old) (n = 86), missing data on cognitive function (n = 80), missing information on cooking fuels (n = 215), never cooked (n = 150), or use of other cooking fuels including kerosene, fuel oil, coal or coke (n = 560). Thus, we included 8674 participants who cooked with biomass fuels or clean fuels for our baseline measure. For the analysis of the association between cooking fuels and elderly cognitive impairment and cognitive decline, we excluded the following participants: those who lost to follow-up (n = 1902), impaired cognitive function (n = 2597) or dementia at baseline (n = 14), a total of 4161 participants without cognitive impairment at baseline were included in our analyses. In comparison with the included 4161 participants, the excluded subjects (n = 5604) were older (88.8 ± 11.4 vs. 81.7 ± 10.0 years). In an additional analysis of the relationship between cooking fuels and elderly cognitive function score, of the 8674 participants who had cognitive functioning assessments in the 2011/2012 survey, 5341 participants had cognitive function scores in the 2011/2012 and 2014 surveys and 2537 participants had cognitive function scores in the 2011/2012, 2014 and 2017/2018 surveys. The measurement (repeated) rate reached 97.6% and 89.2% after omitting a total of 3202 and 2844 participants who passed away and lost to follow-up before the 2014 and 2018 survey, respectively.

### 2.2. Pollution exposure

Household cooking fuels was determined via a series of questionnaires that were documented at baseline and during the follow-up surveys. Cooking with straw, firewood or charcoal was considered to primarily use biomass fuels and cooking with gas, solar energy or electricity was considered to primarily use clean fuels. By using wave-specific data of cooking fuels, we also examined the self-reports of participants who switched between biomass and clean fuels (i.e., participants who primary cooking with biomass or clean fuels at baseline but changed to another fuel type at follow-up).
The latest follow-up survey (2017/2018) supplied questions about ventilation and traffic pollution exposure. Cookstove ventilation was defined as equipping with ventilation facilities (lampblack exhauster, ventilating fan) in the kitchen at home. Traffic pollution exposure was estimated through a question “How many meters is your home horizontal distance from the main traffic artery”. We classified the distance to the main traffic artery into three categories (<100 m, 100–300 m, >300 m).

### 2.3. Outcome

Cognitive ability was measured using the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at each wave. This measure has been widely used to assess cognitive status and turned out to be reliability and validity. It contains a total of thirty items that assess attention, language, visual construction skills, memory, registration, and orientation, with a score range of zero to thirty. Participants were required to answer all items by themselves. Higher scores indicated a better cognitive ability. According to previous literature, we 2.4. Covariates

In our analyses, we controlled for confounding potential variables related to biomass fuel use and cognitive function. Precisely, we controlled for sociodemographic characteristic (age (continuous), sex (male or female), education (no school, once a year or more), residence (rural or urban), marital status (married or other), living with family members (yes or no) and annual household income (<10000/10001–30000/>30000 yuan)), lifestyle (smoke (smoker or non-smoker), drinke (drinker or non-drinker), regular exercise (yes or no)) and health status (baseline MMSE score (continuous), limited in activities (yes or no), body mass index (BMI, obese, overweight, normal, underweight), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (yes or no), diabetes (yes or no), and hypertension (yes or no)). In this study, education was classified as no schooling (0 years) and >1 year. Current marital status was categorized into married and others (divorced, widowed, never married). Smokers and drinkers were defined as current smoking and current drinking. Regular exercise was defined as currently purposeful fitness activities such as walking, playing, and running. Limited in activities defined as elderly who were limitation in daily activities due to health problem in the last 6 months. We categorized BMI as obese (≥28), overweight (24–27.9), normal (18.5–23.9), and underweight (<18.5). CVD, diabetes and hypertension were self-reported using questionnaires. For participants with no formal schooling, we defined an MMSE score of < 18 as cognitive impairment; for those had 1–6 years of education, we defined an MMSE score of < 21 as cognitive impairment; for those had > 6 years of education, we defined an MMSE score of < 24 as cognitive impairment. Sixth, we expanded our survey coverage of populations with cognitive decline from participants with normal cognitive function at baseline, to including participants with cognitive impairment at the time of the 2011/2012 survey. Therefore, we only excluded participants who lost to follow-up and those with cognitive score < 3 (impossible to develop cognitive decline) at baseline. All analyses were performed using R and EmpowerStats.

3. Results

3.1. Basic characteristics of participants

Among 4161 participants without cognitive impairment at baseline, the mean (SD) age was 81.7 (10.0) years and men accounted for 54.6% of the study population (Table 1). Biomass fuel users (48.0%) tended to be illiterate, live in rural areas, more likely to smoke and drink, had lower annual household income than participants cooking with clean fuels. Participants’ basic characteristics by cognitive status are shown in Table S2 in the supplementary material.

2.5. Statistical analysis

The data are presented as percentages and mean ± SD for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the relationship between cooking fuels and cognitive impairment and cognitive decline. The relationship between cooking fuels and cognitive function score was determined by linear models with a generalized estimating equation method for repeated wave-specific measures. The crude incidence rate (IR) per 100 person-years of cognitive impairment and cognitive decline was estimated. We set-up the unadjusted model, age and sex adjusted model and the multivariable-adjusted model for each outcome. We carried out stratified and interaction analyses according to cooking fuels. We also evaluated the risk of participants who reported switching cooking fuels suffering from cognitive impairment and cognitive decline compared with participants without switching cooking fuels. To account for missing data, we employed a multiple imputation (MI) approach, based upon the chained equation method and five replications approach. The results are described in pooled hazard ratios (HRs) or β with 95% CI obtained after conducting the MI procedure. We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our main findings. First, we constructed a competing risk model to evaluate the relationship between biomass fuel use and cognitive impairment and cognitive decline, in which death without cognitive impairment or cognitive decline was treated as a competitive event. Second, we only analyzed complete cases to evaluate potential effects of the MI method. Third, we additional controlled for cookstove ventilation and distance to the main traffic artery. Fourth, the model was further controlling for potential variables, including research region (eastern/southern/central/northern/northwestern/southwestern/northeastern), province-level per-capita GDP, independent cooking (yes or no), sleep quality (good/so so and bad), central obesity (yes or no) (i.e., if a participants’ waist circumference was ≥ 85 cm in men or ≥ 80 cm in women). Fifth, we used an alternate definition of cognitive impairment based on education level, as previous research indicates that illiteracy is particularly prevalent among older adults.

During the 20995.1 person-years of follow-up, 1257 cognitive impairment cases and 1657 cognitive decline cases were observed. This included 644 cases of cognitive impairment and 837 cases of cognitive decline using biomass fuels. The incidence rate for cognitive impairment (IR per 100 person-years: 7.1 vs. 6.1) and cognitive decline (IR per 100 person-years: 12.7 vs. 11.3) was higher among participants cooking with biomass fuels than those cooking with clean fuels (Table 2). The unadjusted analysis showed that reported cooking with biomass fuels was positively related to an elevated risk of cognitive impairment and cognitive decline. Upon controlling for age and sex, the positive correlation remained unchanged. In our multivariable-adjusted models, we additionally adjusted for education, residence, marital status, living with family members, annual household income, smoking, drinking, regular exercise, baseline MMSE score, limited in activities, body mass index, CVD, diabetes, hypertension and the relationship between biomass fuels and cognitive impairment and cognitive decline exhibited a similar trend (Table 2). For biomass fuel use, the multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CI) for cognitive impairment and cognitive decline were 1.19 (1.04, 1.37) and 1.18 (1.04, 1.33), respectively. The results were supported by sensitivity analyses. Results of competing risk model in which we considered death without cognitive impairment or cognitive decline as the competing risk were consistent with our primary analysis. The model included only complete cases, was additional adjustment for cookstove ventilation and distance to the main traffic artery, was additionally adjustment for possible confounders, used the alternate cognitive impairment definition and included participants with cognitive impairment at baseline were consistent with our initial adjusted, imputed model (Tables S3 and S4 in the supplementary material).

Among a total of 1996 participants using biomass fuels at baseline, during follow-up, 928 participants (46.5%) switched to clean fuels. In comparison to persistent using biomass fuels, reported changing primary cooking fuels from biomass to clean fuels exhibited a reduced risk of cognitive impairment (IR per 100 person-years: 7.0 vs. 7.2, HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.82) and cognitive decline (IR per 100 person-years: 11.1 vs. 15.0, HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.76) (Table 3). Among a total of 2165 participants using clean fuels at baseline, during follow-up, 296 (13.7%) participants switched to biomass fuels. In comparison to persistent using biomass fuels, reported changing primary cooking fuels from clean to biomass fuels exhibited an increasing risk of cognitive impairment (IR per 100 person-years: 8.0 vs. 5.8, HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.69) and

3.3. Relationship between biomass fuel use and cognitive score

Of 8674 participants who measured cognitive function at the 2011/2012 wave, 5341 participants repeated their assessments in the 2014 wave and 2537 participants again repeated cognitive function measurements in the 2018 wave. The unadjusted analysis showed that reported cooking with biomass fuels was related to a decrease in MMSE score (β: 0.90, 95% CI: 1.21, 0.59). After adjusting for age and sex, reported biomass fuel use was related to a relatively constant decrease in MMSE score (β: 0.79, 95% CI: 1.05, 0.54). Although the estimate was reduced, the fully adjusted model maintained the association, as cooking with biomass fuels was negatively related to MMSE score (β: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.14) (Table 4). In comparison to persistent using biomass fuels, reported changing primary cooking fuels from biomass to clean fuels showed a noteworthy MMSE score elevation (β: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.17, 1.26) (Table 4).

3.4. Relationship between ventilation and cognitive impairment and cognitive decline

The incidence rate for cognitive impairment (IR per 100 person-years: 17.8 vs. 18.7) and cognitive decline (IR per 100 person-years: 19.2 vs. 20.9) was lower among ventilated cooking fuel users than non-ventilated cooking fuel users (Fig. 1). Participants cooking without ventilated cookstoves was related to an increasing cognitive impairment (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.58) and cognitive decline (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.38) risk compared with those cooking with ventilated cookstoves, irrespective of residential types of cooking fuel (Fig. 1). aHRs were controlled by age, sex, education, residence, marital status, living with family members, annual household income, smoke, drink, regular exercise, baseline MMSE score, limited in activities, BMI, CVD, diabetes and hypertension.

3.5. Effect modification

We stratified our analysis by participant characteristics and found regular exercise modified the association of biomass fuels and cognitive decline (p-value for interaction = 0.04). Similar interactions were identified between biomass fuel use and living with family members on cognitive impairment (p-value for interaction < 0.001), as compared to participants who were not living with family members (Table 5).

4. Discussion

This national cohort study evaluated the relationship between cooking with biomass fuels and cognitive impairment and cognitive decline. Results indicated that older adults who reported using cooking with biomass fuels had a remarkable elevated cognitive impairment and cognitive decline risk, and a lower score on cognitive function. Participants who reported changing their primary cooking fuels from biomass to clean fuels related with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment and cognitive decline. In addition, cooking without ventilated cookstoves was related with an elevated cognitive impairment and cognitive decline risk, regardless of cooking fuels types. It is possible that living without family members and those with irregular exercise may be more vulnerable to the cognitive effects of biomass fuels. Our findings extend existing literature involving outdoor air pollution and provide evidence of a negative relationship between biomass fuel use and cognitive function among the oldest-old. Our findings are consistent with previously works demonstrating an inverse relationship between indoor air pollution from fuels for domestic energy and cognitive ability. A study from Mexico showed that exposure to household biomass fuel smoke (wood or coal) was related to Table 3

poorer cognitive function among old Mexican population (mean age: approximately 63 years). In an India study, old Indians (mean age: approximately 53 years) exposed to air pollution from household fuels were two times more likely to exhibit cognitive impairment. A recently Chinese study indicated that solid fuel users (mean age: approximately 60 years) had a 0.81 lower cognitive score. Our study provides new evidence that late-life exposure to household air pollution from biomass fuel use is a common environmental risk factor for cognitive impairment and cognitive decline among the oldest-old adults. The existence of such a relationship suggests that a decreased exposure to biomass fuel can help diminish the public health burden related to cognitive impairment and cognitive decline amongst the oldest-old population.

We observed a stronger relationship between cooking with biomass fuels and cognitive impairment among participants living without family members. This finding indicates that living with family members may contribute to delaying cognitive aging in elderly adults. One feasible explanation is that elderly adults who live with family may be able to reduce their frequency of cooking, thus reducing the chance of being exposed to biomass fuel smoke from cooking. In China, family support is a long-held tradition and elderly people are generally looked after by their family members. For example, their children may share in the housework, as cooking. In addition, family support is of paramount importance for older adults with brain disorders. Our results also indicate that participants who performed irregular exercise exhibited a higher risk for cognitive decline, if they exposure to biomass fuels. One possible explanation for this finding is psychological and cognitive benefits accrue from participating in regular exercise in older adults. Indeed, our research suggests that outdoor exercise helps prevent older adults from being exposed to biomass fuels, thus temporarily avoiding direct damage from household air pollution.

It is noteworthy that older adults changing primary cooking fuels from biomass to clean fuels exhibited a remarkable lower cognitive impairment and cognitive decline risk and a higher cognitive score, as compared to persistent biomass fuel users. Importantly, the opposite effect of changing from clean fuels to biomass fuels on cognitive status was also observed. These findings suggest that improving indoor air quality is beneficial to postponing cognitive aging, and that deteriorating indoor air quality aggravates cognitive conditions among older adults. Prior studies indicate that changing from biomass fuels to cleaner fuels for cooking can improve indoor air quality. For example, doing so can decrease emissions of PM2.5 in homes and has certain benefits to human health. For instance, in China, switching cooking fuels from solid to clean was associated with a lower CVD mortality risk, while using biogas to replace biomass fuels for cooking was related to less cognitive decline in lung function and a lower COPD occurrence risk. Our results further support the existence of a negative association of household air pollution with cognition performance. One possible explanation is that older adults tended to particularly sensitive to their social and physical environment and thus especially vulnerable to adversely affect by environmental degradation. Our findings may provide significant benefits for the general public, considering that cognitive condition of old population is thought to be modifiable. | Cognitive impairment                           | With ventilation                     | Without ventilation                  |

Our findings in this study suggest that equipped with ventilation facilities in kitchen could have some beneficial effects on delaying cognitive deterioration in the oldest-old, even among clean fuel users. Ventilation can effectively reduce the indoor concentration of deleterious substances with emission from biomass fuels combustion. Interestingly, cooking with ventilation facilities appears to be advantageous to clean fuel users. It is important to note that in rural areas, exclusive use of clean fuels is very scarce, most rural families select one fuel type as a primary source of energy while selecting a secondary fuel type as standby. Therefore, in our study, the favorable effect of ventilation among clean fuel users is likely due to household fuel stacking for cooking.

While the potential biological mechanisms by which exposure to biomass fuel smoke affects cognitive aging among older adults remain obscure, these mechanisms may be linked to fine PM, which is an essential component of air pollution. For example, burnt biomass fuel produce large contaminants and release fine PM (e.g., PM2.5, PM10). Importantly, evidence suggests that PM exposure is linked to decreased cognitive function. Sustained exposure to large amounts of fine particles may result in a direct transference to the central nervous system (CNS), thus causing neuropathology. Animal studies indicate that the brain is a target organ for the detrimental effects of PM and ultrafine particles can be directly transferred into the CNS along the axons of the olfactory nerve. Based on autopsy research, PM has been observed in trigeminal ganglia capillaries and human olfactory bulb periglomerular neurons. Importantly, PM-CNS entry may induce neurotoxic consequences through activating innate immune system of the brain, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress pathways. A postmortem study of adolescents and younger adults demonstrated that, in the pollution-exposed group, 40% of urbanites exhibited tau hyperphosphorylation and 51% of urbanites exhibited amyloid-β (Aβ) diffuse plaques, as compared with none of the unexposed urbanites. Of significance, tau and Aβ deposits in the brain are considered as important pathological changes that can lead to cognitive impairment.

Strengths of the present study include its prospective nature and a large number of Chinese older adults 80-years of age and above, which enabled us to carry out an expansive assessment research on relationship between biomass fuel use and cognitive status among older adults. However, several limitations must be considered. First, our findings are only generalizable to the oldest-old adults in China, but it is possible that the health effects of cooking with biomass fuels would be different for young individuals. Second, the assessment of household air pollution was based on self-reported primary fuel usage thus, neglected cooking fuels stacking and recall error of exposure misclassification might have produced biased results. It is possible that switching cooking fuels may be a progressive sustained process and if switching to a low polluted fuel is beneficial to cognitive status compared to consistent high pollution fuel users, fuel stacking during transition would have biased results towards the null. Third, for participants who changed cooking fuels during follow-up, the precise time of changing was not investigated; thus, it is impossible to determine an effect of switching time on cognitive ability. Finally, the use of ventilation and traffic pollution exposure was investigated on follow-up survey rather than at baseline, thus moving could induce misclassification. However, given that our target population is older adults – including a considerable number of the oldest old – whose lifestyle is in a steady state, the misclassification is probably very small.

In conclusion, our national prospective cohort study revealed that cooking with biomass fuels is related to a higher risk of elderly cognitive impairment and cognitive decline, especially amongst individuals not living with family members and those with an irregular exercise pattern. Also, these risks may be lower among those changing cooking fuels from biomass to clean fuels and those with ventilation facilities. Reducing the use of biomass fuels or promoting ventilation equipment may be effective interventions to delay the rapid increase in prevalence of cognitive aging associated with an aging population. Nonetheless, more studies Table 5 (continued)
