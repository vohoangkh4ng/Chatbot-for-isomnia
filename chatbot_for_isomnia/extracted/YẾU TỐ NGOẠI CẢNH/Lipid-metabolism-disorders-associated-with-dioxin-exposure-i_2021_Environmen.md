Dioxins, environmentally stable and ubiquitous, have been found to induce metabolic changes especially in lipids and be related to multiple diseases. However, limited study is available on lipid alternations related to human exposure to dioxins. This study aims to explore the serum lipidomic characterization and to understand the underlying mechanisms of adverse health risks associated with dioxin exposure. A lipidomic study integrating nontargeted lipidomics, and targeted free fatty acid (FFA) and acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) analyses were conducted to investigate the 94 serum samples from two groups of male workers with remarkably different dioxin concentrations. The obtained results exhibited distinct lipidomic signatures between the high and low exposed groups. A total of 37 lipids were identified with the significant changes. The results revealed that dioxin exposure caused accumulations of triglyceride (TG), ceramide (Cer) and sphingoid (So), remodeling of glycerophospholipid (GP), imbalanced FFA metabolism, as well as upregulation of platelet-activating factor (PAF). These findings implied the associations between dioxin exposure and potential adverse health risks including inflammation, apoptosis, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and liver diseases. This study is the first to explain the associations between dioxin exposure and health effects at the level of lipid metabolism.

## 1. Introduction

Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-furans (PCDFs) are named collectively as dioxins. Dioxins can be generated when organics, oxygen and chlorine are available at suitable temperatures catalyzed by metals. The toxic chemicals are mostly by-products from a range of industrial activities including waste incineration, fuel burning, metal smelting and refining as well as chemical manufacturing. Dioxins are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are extremely stable with half-lives of 7–11 years. Because of the high lipophilicity and water insolubility, dioxins tend to accumulate in plankton, plant leaves, and animal fat, especially in food chains. Besides, dioxins can be easily adsorbed to inorganic particles, such as ash and soil. Collectively, dioxins are ubiquitous in environment and thus cause widespread exposure of humans and animals.

Abundant studies have been carried out to explore the dioxin-mediated adverse effects in humans. Chloracne is the best proven acute effect induced by dioxins according to previous studies. As for chronic effects of dioxins, plenty of epidemiologic studies have reported that dioxin exposure associates with various health risks, such as fatty liver, reproductive disorders, metabolic syndrome, endocrine disruption, cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Meanwhile, the toxic mechanisms of dioxins have been extensively explored through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Dioxins have been proved to be the activators of the acyl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which triggers the expressions of target genes and proteins. The AhR-induced signaling pathway is responsible for dioxin- associated physiological effects. Majority of the mechanism research focused on the expression of genes and proteins at the upstream of the signaling pathways. It is worth mentioning that metabolomics has been gradually applied to investigate the mechanism of dioxin toxicity at the level of the downstream metabolites using rodent and cell models. Accumulating evidences suggest that metabolomics is useful to replenish our understanding of the biochemical effects mediated by external stressors. Taken together, it is meaningful for epidemiologic studies to determine the potential relationships between human dioxin exposure and metabolic characteristics, which may play an important role in the early detection of potential diseases. Until now, metabolomics method has limited applications on examining the metabolic changes caused by human dioxin exposure. For instance, a serum metabolomics study of a worker cohort showed no significant metabolic perturbations at the temporal TCDD exposure levels. Another serum metabolomics study reported that human exposure to POPs induced perturbations in sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids levels. In addition, Jeanneret et al. evaluated and identified steroid-related biomarkers in urine samples of two cohorts including Czech chemical workers and humans exposed to the incineration fumes of a municipal waste incinerator, with 24 steroids and bile acids identified to change significantly. Previously, we also investigated the serum biomarkers of dioxin exposure in a Chinese male cohort. The results showed that dioxin exposure resulted in dysregulated metabolisms of free fatty acid (FFA), glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid, etc. and 16 identified biomarkers were lipids. However, only one single analytical approach was used in this study, which may limit the number of detected metabolites. Lipidomics is an emerging and potent method to study the complete lipidome in biological system and facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism. In order to get a deep insight of lipid changes and signaling network of lipid metabolism associated with human dioxin exposure, a lipidomics study is necessary. In this study, a comprehensive lipidomics study including non-targeted lipidomics analysis, and targeted FFA and acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) analyses, was carried out to profile the lipidomes in human serum samples and to figure out the dioxin-related lipid disturbances.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Study population

The recruited population was consistent with that in the previous study. A total of 215 male workers from three factories (Shenzhen, China) including Baoan waste incineration power plant, Kuisheng electronics factory, and AVARY electronics factory were involved. The procedures of serum collection were introduced in the previous study and are available in supplementary material. The research was approved by the ethics committees of Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention. All participants have submitted informed consent and completed the self-reported questionnaires. Vegetarians and samples of individuals with genetic diseases, clinical diseases and under long-term medication were excluded.

### 2.2. Dioxin quantification and sample used in lipidomics study

A total of seventeen 2,3,7,8-substituted dioxin congeners designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) were quantified as previous reported, which are listed in supplementary material. The total level of serum dioxins was expressed by Toxic Equivalent Quantity (TEQ). To calculate the total TEQ of a serum sample, the amount of each dioxin congener is multiplied with their Toxic Equivalency Factor (TEF) proposed by WHO and then added together. To unveil the dioxin-related changes in lipid metabolism, serum samples used for lipidomics study were selected according to the quartile distribution of the TEQ values of the 215 male workers (Table S1, supplementary material). Samples of the fourth quartile were defined as the high dioxin exposed group and samples of the first quartile were adopted as the low dioxin exposed group for the lipidomics study. One of the serum samples belonging to the high dioxin exposed group was excluded for the insufficient volume.

### 2.3. Nontargeted lipidomic profiling

#### 2.3.1. Global lipid extraction

For global serum lipid extraction, 400 μL methanol (MeOH) was added to 100 μL serum for protein precipitation. After a 1-minute vortex, 1.2 mL of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was added to the mixture, which was vortexed for another 10 mins. Subsequently, 200 μL of water was added to promote phase separation. After a 10-min equilibration, the mixture was centrifuged at 15 000g for 10 min at 4◦C. The obtained organic phase was collected and dried under air vacuum. The samples were reconstituted with 120 μL of acetonitrile (ACN)/isopropanol (IPA)/H2O (65:30:5, v/v/v) containing 5 μg/mL of mixed IS solution containing ceramide [Cer (d18:1/17:0)], sphingomyelin [SM (d18:1/12:0)], triglyceride [TG (15:0/15:0/15:0)], lysophosphatidylcholine [LPC (19:0)] and phosphatidylcholine [PC (19:0/19:0)] as internal standard (IS) before the instrumental analysis. The final samples were the supernatants collected after a centrifugation (15 000g, 10 min, 4◦C). Quality control (QC) sample was prepared by pooling 10 μL of every sample.

#### 2.3.2. LC-MS analysis

An ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-orbitrap fusion tribrid mass spectrometer (MS) system (Thermo Scientific, USA) was applied for nontargeted lipidomics analysis. Detailed chromatographic conditions and MS parameters for full and MS2 scan modes are listed in supplementary material.

### 2.4. Targeted FFA analysis

#### 2.4.1. FFA extraction and derivatization

FFA extraction and derivatization were done by applying a method reported previously. Briefly speaking, serum FFAs were extracted by adding 400 μL of MeOH to 100 μL of serum to achieve protein precipitation. Meanwhile, a blank sample was also prepared following the same procedures. The supernatant was collected after centrifugating at 15 000 g for 10 min at 4◦C and was dried under air vacuum. Before the instrumental analysis, the dried samples were reconstituted using 120 μL of MeOH/water (4:1, v/v) containing 1 μg/mL of 4-chloro-phenylalanine (4-Cl-Phe) as IS. Subsequently, 3-nitrophenylhydrazine hydrochloride and 1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride were added into the obtained samples successively in the proportion 1:1:1 (v/v/v) for FFA derivatization. The mixtures were vortexed for 30 s and were allowed to react at room temperature for 30 min. After a final centrifugation (15 000g, 10 min, 25◦C), the supernatant was collected for following analysis.

#### 2.4.2. LC-MS quantitative analysis

FFA analysis was conducted by using a UHPLC system coupled to a TSQ Quantiva™ Triple Quadrupole MS (Thermo Scientific, USA). Separation was performed on a luna omega polar C18 column (1.6 μm particles, 2.1 mm × 150 mm, Phenomenex, USA) using 0.01% formic acid in H2O and MeOH as mobile phase A and B. Four short-chain FFAs (aliphatic tails of 5 or fewer), 6 medium-chain FFAs (aliphatic tails from 6 to 12) and 14 long-chain FFAs (aliphatic tails from 13 to 21 carbons) were detected using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The SRM parameters are listed in supplementary material. All the FFAs were measured under negative ionization mode and identified with m/z. values, MS/MS fragments and retention times. Chromatographic conditions were set as follows. A flow rate of 0.25 mL/min and a column temperature at 40◦C were used. The temperature of autosampler was maintained at 25 ◦C and the injection volume was 10 μL. The chromatographic gradient changed as follows: 0.0–0.5 min kept at 30% B, 0.5–11 min increased from 30% B to 100% B and kept for 4.0 min, 15.1 min back to 30% B and equilibrated for 3 min. As for MS parameters, spray voltage was set at 2.5 kV. Sheath gas and auxiliary gas were set at 40 and 10 arbitrary, respectively. Ion transfer tube and vaporizer temperatures were set at 325 ◦C and 350 ◦C.

## 2.5. Targeted acyl-CoA analysis

### 2.5.1. Acyl-CoA extraction
Briefly speaking, serum acyl-CoAs was extracted by adding 400 μL of MeOH to 100 μL of serum to achieve protein precipitation. The supernatant was collected after centrifugating at 15 000 g for 10 min at 4 ◦C and was dried under air vacuum. Before the instrumental analysis, the dried samples were reconstituted using 120 μL of MeOH/water (4:1, v/v) containing 1 μg/mL of 4-Cl-Phe as IS.

### 2.5.2. LC-MS quantitative analysis
For the analysis of acyl-CoAs, the method was developed based on a previous report with slight modification. It was performed using UHPLC coupled with high resolution Orbitrap MS (Q Exactive MS, Thermo Scientific). A total of 19 acyl-CoAs were detected in parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode (Table S4, supplementary material). A reverse phase column Luna C18 (2.1 mm × 100 mm × 1.6 μm, Phenomenex) was used for measuring acyl-CoAs⋅H2O containing 10 mM ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) and pure ACN were mobile phase A and B. Detailed MS parameters are showed in Table S5 (supplementary material).

implemented. And p-values < 0.05 were deemed close correlation. In the targeted FFA and acyl-CoA analyses, the differential FFAs and acyl-CoAs were determined based on the latter two criteria: p-values in Mann-Whitney U test and the p-values in adjusted partial correlation analysis. Based on the identified lipid biomarkers, MetaboAnalyst with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database was used for pathway analysis.

## 2.8. Statistical analysis
Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test and Fisher’s exact test were applied to test the significant differences of demographic characteristics between the two groups as appropriate. Specifically, Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables while chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables. If there are >20% of cells with an expected value of <5 in a contingency table, Fisher’s exact test is applied otherwise chi-squared test. Partial correlation analysis with adjustment by age, BMI, smoking status, drinking frequency and education level was applied to investigate the correlation between the candidate lipid biomarkers and the serum dioxin concentrations. Both TEQ values and peak intensities in the adjusted partial correlation analysis were log-transformed. The differences of lipid biomarkers between the two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U test followed by a false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. All statistics analyses were performed using Software IBM SPSS Statistics Version 24.0 with the statistical significance set at two-side test of p-value < 0.05.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Characteristics of the subjects
The TEQ values of the 215 serum samples are showed in Table S1 (supplementary material). The samples used for lipidomics study were chosen based on quartile distribution. Serum samples in the lowest quartile with TEQ values ranging from 3.29 to 9.94 pg TEQ/g lipid were chosen as low exposed group. Samples in the highest quartile with TEQ values ranging from 29.49 to 765.35 pg TEQ/g lipid were chosen as high exposed group. The detailed characteristics of the subjects involved in the lipidomics study are shown in Table 1. The dioxin levels of the two groups showed significantly different with p-values < 0.001. It must be noticed that the cigarette smoking frequencies and educational levels between the two groups were statistically different. Therefore, adjusted partial correlation analysis was demanded to eliminate these interferences that can also cause metabolic changes.

### 3.2. Identification of lipid biomarkers
LC-MS based nontargeted lipidomics study were conducted for lipidomic profiling of human serum to investigate the possible lipid changes associated with dioxin exposure. The developed PLS-DA models showed that the sample points of high exposed group and low exposed group differentiated clearly in both positive and negative ionization modes, indicating that dioxin exposure was associated with noticeable alterations of lipid metabolic phenotypes in humans. The goodness-of-fit (R2Y) and predictive capability (Q2) are two indicators for the initial validation of the PLS-DA models. The R2Y and Q2 values of the established models were > 0.5, indicating high goodness of fit and predictive ability of the PLS-DA models. The 500-time response permutation tests of the developed PLS-DA models are showed in Fig. 1C and D. The R2 and Q2 values for the original model are indicated on the far right (X-axis = 1) and for the permutation test model are on the left (X-axis = 0). The intercepts of Q2 and Y-axis were all below zero suggesting that the models were not overfitting. The p-values obtained from the CV-ANOVA tests of the developed PLS-DA models were 3.18E-031.

As the vital species in energy storage and metabolism, remarkable changes in GLs were observed in high dioxin exposure group. As the heatmap shows, the MG and DG categories were down-regulation and the TG species were elevated. MG (16:0), DG (16:0/16:0), DG (18:0/20:4) and DG (32:1p) reduced significantly in high exposed group when compared with low exposed group. Oppositely, the levels of TG (16:0/18:1/18:3) and TG (20:0/10:0/10:1) were elevated obviously. These data revealed the underlying increase in TG biosynthesis resulting in TG accumulation, which were related to high dioxin exposure.

Sphingolipids, serve as an important component of the cell membranes, also play a role in many cellular functions. Remarkable changes of sphingolipid categories were found to be correlated to high dioxin exposure. SMs that can be found in cell membranes were down-regulated, while Cer and So that play important roles in signaling increased obviously. In our study, the levels of Cer (d32:0), So (d12:0 + pO) and So (d14:0 + pO) upregulated apparently with high fold changes as 21.39, 14.11 and 17.33. Contrarily, remarkable reductions of SM (d42:1 + pO) and SM (d32:4) were found in high exposed group with low fold changes as 0.63 and 0.49. The findings indicated the existences of SM hydrolysis, accumulations of Cer and So accompanied with high dioxin exposure in. Table 2

The other differential GPs are shown in Fig. S3 (supplementary material). Detailedly speaking, the levels of LPA (18:2), LPA (20:4), PE (18:0/18:1), LPE (18:0), PI (16:0/20:4), and PI (18:0/20:4) decreased. All results suggested that high dioxin exposure extensively altered the GP homeostasis in humans.

### Dioxin exposure associated with alternations of other lipids
Based on the results of the nontargeted lipidomics study, OAHFA (36:1) and PAF (16:1) were identified to be significant biomarkers, both of which increased dramatically. Because we previously found that fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) changed significantly related to dioxin exposure, FFAs and acyl-CoAs that are involved in the pathway were targeted. Taking into account of the difficulty in detecting FFAs directly by MS due to their poor ionization efficiency, derivatization of FFAs has become a well-accepted and effective step to increase their volatility and improve ionization efficiency. Consequently, the levels of 24 FFAs were also analyzed by a targeted LC-MS/MS method with derivatization separately. All the detailed results of the targeted FFAs including partial correlation analyses, Mann-Whitney U tests and fold changes, are summarized in Table S7 (supplementary material). Three LCSFAs [palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0) and arachidic acid (C20:0)] were determined to be differential and showed downward trends in high dioxin exposure group. The accumulations of AcCa (10:4) and AcCa (16:1) were also observed. However, none of the targeted acyl-CoAs were identified as biomarkers because their levels did not differ significantly between the two groups according to the Mann-Whitney U tests. With all these results together, high dioxin exposure triggered the disorders of FFA metabolism.

Our results also found the decline in the total abundance of all the SM biomarkers and the increases in the levels of Cer and So biomarkers closely related to high dioxin exposure. SM category is widely found in cell membranes while Cer and So categories are involved in a diverse range of cellular functions especially Cer category. As depicted in Fig. 6, the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis starts with the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA, followed by a series of reactions, leading to the formation of Cer and subsequent formation of SM. Cer are the hydrolysis products of SM while So are the breakdown products of Cer. Consequently, the observed significant alternations of sphingolipids indicated that high dioxin exposure triggered the hydrolysis of SM and the overproductions of Cer.

and So. Cer have been reported to be implicated in multiple signaling cascades in immune cells, including activation of B cells, and release of cytokines. Cer are also especially important in the induction of apoptosis and inflammation. In addition to Cer, So are able to alter cellular signaling reactions, which bind to the 14–3-3 protein isoforms, regulate their phosphorylation at the dimer interface, and inhibit the antiapoptotic functions of 14–3-3. The increased level of So category is corresponding to our previous finding of dioxin-associated sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) upregulation because S1P is the phosphorylation product of So. S1P is reported to induce cell inflammatory immune responses. Collectively, the disturbances of sphingolipid metabolism in humans imply the inflammatory and apoptotic responses to dioxin exposure. It has been reported that vascular inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis. Therefore, our finding provided another evidence that dioxin exposure possibly induces vascular inflammation, which may further trigger atherosclerosis.

We also observed the metabolic dysregulations of GPs in response to dioxin exposure. As shown in Fig. 6, the overall abundance of GP biomarkers presented a downward trend. PC, PE, PS and PI commonly represent the back bone of most biological membranes while their hydrolysis products (LPC, LPE, LPS and LPI) function in various signaling pathways. It is generally believed that the variations in GP species composition might affect membrane curvature and thereby influence membrane fusion, fission and vesicle transport. The GP remodeling occurred in humans exposed to dioxins suggested the impacts of dioxins on cell homeostasis in humans. As key building blocks and metabolites of lipid metabolism, FFA structure and concentration are useful indicators of lipid metabolism. Herein, three LCSFAs (C16:0, C18:0 and C20:0) were identified to be downregulated in response to dioxin exposure. Combining the results of increases in TGs, Cers and AcCas that are derived from FFAs, we believed that the decline in FFAs could be attributed to the upregulated FFA utilization and downregulated FFA biosynthesis. Besides, the accumulations of AcCas and the inapparent changes of acyl-CoAs suggested the suppression of FAO. These results may support the previously reported finding that dioxin exposure activated AhR, influenced FFA metabolism as well as induced spontaneous hepatic steatosis or fatty liver. Besides, serum concentrations of AcCas were reported to be associated with liver diseases in humans. Taken together, the imbalanced FFA metabolism might be one of the toxic mechanisms of dioxin exposure being related to liver diseases. PAF is a kind of phospholipid derived from PC with potent, diverse physiological actions, particularly as a mediator of inflammation. The remarkable increase in serum PAF (16:1) again indicated the possible vascular inflammation related to dioxin exposure in humans, which echoed the findings of TG accumulation and sphingolipid metabolism disturbances.

5. Conclusion

One of the most notable strengths of this study is the integration of nontargeted lipidomics study, and targeted FFA and acyl-CoA analyses, which not only provided global lipid changes towards dioxin exposure but determined the variations of FFAs and acyl-CoAs in human serum. The established approach also provided a credible tool for the search of dioxin exposure-related lipids. As far as we know, this is the first lipidomics study of human serum samples with dioxin exposure. However, this study does have drawbacks. To begin with, the bias in the sampling cannot be ignored. The sample size of this study was small and it is necessary to expand the sample size for convincing results. Also, the study only looked at the adult male workers and the two person groups were not fully demographically matched in the aspects of smoking frequency and educational level. The results need further verification with participants that are from general population and more demographically matched. This is a cross-sectional study using single serum samples; therefore, we are no able to ensure whether the differential lipids we identified can serve as effective biomarkers of dioxin exposure. Our findings also need to be verified with different time-point samples. Secondly, biological measurements on enzyme activity and gene expression in the upstream of the altered pathways are needed to deepen the understanding of adverse effects associated with dioxin exposure. Thirdly, the two-stage biomarker screening method may bias the results and we cannot rule out the potential type I error. Lastly, the identified lipid biomarkers in the nontargeted lipidomics were not confirmed with standard chemicals due to the unavailability of standard chemicals. We could not rule out the possibility of inaccurate lipid identification by database match. Nevertheless, the present study integrated nontargeted lipidomic profiling, targeted FFA analysis and targeted acyl-CoA analysis to investigate the alternations of serum lipids related to high dioxin exposure in a male worker cohort. The results revealed that dioxin exposure associated closely with TG accumulation, Cer and So over-production, GP remodeling, imbalanced FFA metabolism, as well as PAF upregulation. The study provides evidences of adverse health risks associated with dioxin exposure, such as inflammation, apoptosis, CVDs, and liver diseases. Despite of the limitations mentioned above, the findings provide novel insights into dioxin toxicity from the perspective of lipid metabolism.
