Prenatal arsenic exposure is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer along with multiple non-carcinogenic outcomes, including respiratory diseases in arsenic-contaminated areas. Limited epidemiologic data exist on whether in utero arsenic exposure influences lung development and subsequent respiratory health. We investigated the association between gestational arsenic exposure and childhood lung function in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Urinary arsenic speciation including inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and arsenobetaine was measured in maternal urine samples collected during pregnancy and spirometry was performed in offspring at a median age of 7.4 years. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second of exhalation (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75) standardized z-scores were assessed in linear models as dependent variables with the log2-transformed summation of urinary arsenic species (ΣAs = iAs + MMA + DMA) corrected for specific gravity as an independent variable and with adjustment for maternal smoking status, children’s age, sex and height. Among the 358 children in the study, a doubling of ΣAs was associated with a 0.08 (ß) decrease in FVC z-scores (95% confidence interval (CI) from 0.14 to 0.01) and 0.10 (ß) (95% CI from 0.18 to 0.02) decrease in FEV1 z-scores. The inverse association appeared stronger among those mothers with lower secondary methylation index (urinary DMA/MMA), especially among girls. No association was observed for FEF25-75 z-scores. Our results suggest that gestation arsenic exposure at levels relevant to the general US population during the vulnerable period of lung formation may adversely affect lung function in childhood.

## 1. Introduction

Arsenic is an element ubiquitously present in our water, food and air from both natural and anthropogenic activities. Human exposure to arsenic comes through inhalation, dermal absorption, and ingestion. Consumption of contaminated drinking water is the predominant exposure pathway. However, ingestion of arsenic from food is also a significant source of exposure of growing concern, particularly for populations non-occupationally exposed and with access to drinking water with relatively low arsenic levels.

Inorganic arsenic (iAs), including arsenite (AsIII) and arsenate (AsV), is a well-established toxic chemical form, and its exposure is of major public health concern. Chronic iAs exposure is associated with an increased risk of different cancers including skin, lung, and bladder among others. Exposure to iAs is also associated with other health effects among populations exposed to highly contaminated drinking water, in particular, respiratory outcomes. In arsenic-contaminated areas, fetal and early childhood exposure has been associated with increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections and prevalence of respiratory symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath, chronic cough, and wheeze) during childhood, as well as reduced lung function and mortality from lung cancer, bronchiectasis, and tuberculosis in A.J.

adulthood. However, the possibility that even relatively low iAs exposure levels early in life may alter both childhood and adulthood respiratory health requires further epidemiologic and mechanistic investigations.

Respiratory abnormalities can be identified from patterns of pulmonary function measured by spirometry such as obstructive or restrictive airflow. A recently published meta-analysis and systematic review of studies mainly among highly exposed adult populations reported an association between arsenic exposure and respiratory health, especially in relation to restrictive lung function. Among school-age children consuming contaminated water in rural Bangladesh, gestational arsenic exposure also related to airflow restrictive patterns with a decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in the first second of exhalation (FEV1). Further, arsenic-induced alterations in inflammatory biomarkers in children in Mexico were related to the development of restrictive lung diseases. In animal models, arsenic in drinking water during pregnancy increased resistance in the peripheral airway and markers of tissue stiffness in the offspring.

Ingested iAs is metabolized in the liver through a multistep process via the one-carbon metabolism cycle that results in the formation of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) followed by dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) that are primarily excreted in urine within a few days. Thus, the sum of iAs and its methylated arsenic species (MMA and DMA) in urine is used as a biomarker of ingested iAs exposure. Methylation of iAs is an important mechanism in the metabolism of iAs, and the ratio between urinary MMA/iAs and DMA/MMA can be used as markers of iAs methylation capacity. Arsenic easily crosses the placenta and enters the fetus such that maternal blood levels positively correlate with infant cord blood levels. Therefore, we investigated arsenic exposure during pregnancy in a general US population, and evaluated maternal arsenic methylation capacity in relation to the pulmonary function among children in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort study (NHBCS) to test the hypothesis that fetal exposure to arsenic affects lung development ultimately impacting lung function in school-aged children.

## Methods

### Study population

Our study comprised infants enrolled in the NHBCS, a longitudinal pregnancy cohort designed to examine the impacts of toxicants in drinking water and diet on maternal–child health. Since 2009, the NHBCS recruited pregnant women 18–45 years of age at approximately 24–28 weeks of gestation from prenatal clinics in the rural state of New Hampshire. Eligibility criteria include English literacy, the use of a private, unregulated water system at home (e.g., private well), not planning to move during pregnancy and a singleton birth as described previously. The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College approved this study, and all participants provided written informed consent.

### Samples collection

Mothers provided a spot urinary samples at approximately 24–28 weeks of gestation during the enrollment period in polyethylene sterile containers. Samples were processed and frozen at -80 ◦C within 24 h until analysis. We also collected household tap water samples at enrollment to analyze their arsenic concentrations.

### Laboratory analysis

Urine-specific gravity was analyzed using a handheld refractometer with automatic temperature compensation (PAL-10S; ATAGO Co Ltd). The urine samples were thoroughly thawed, centrifuged, and the supernatant pipetted into 0.6 ml vials before arsenic speciation analysis. The Trace Element Analysis Core at Dartmouth College carried out arsenic speciation using anion exchange chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). It was an Agilent LC 1260 equipped with a Thermo AS7, 2 × 250 mm column and a Thermo AG7, 2 × 50 mm guard column interfaced with an Agilent 8900 ICP-MS in oxygen reaction cell mode to remove polyatomic interferences. We measured concentrations of urinary AsIII, AsV, MMA, DMA, and arsenobetaine (AsB). A gradient mobile phase was prepared starting with 200 mM ammonium carbonate. Authentic standards from SPEX Certiprep and Sigma-Aldrich were used to calibrate the arsenic concentrations under each chromatographic peak. Several NIST reference materials 2669 level I and level II were also analyzed in each analysis batch, with recoveries close to 100%. The arsenic species limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 0.01 to 0.39 μg/L across batches. We calculated the LODs as the mean of the blank concentrations plus three times their standard deviation multiplied by the dilution factor. We did not observe urinary DMA concentrations below the LOD. However, there were 149 (41.6%), 76 (21.2%), 83 (23.2%), and 83 (23.2%) observations with concentrations of AsIII, AsV, MMA, and AsB below the LOD. We applied the value of LOD/√2 when concentrations were < LOD. Total arsenic in tap water samples was measured with the Agilent 8900 ICP-MS in direct solution acquisition mode with a LOD of 0.04 μg/L.

### Lung function

Children’s lung function was assessed with spirometry along with ascertainment of children’s age, height and weight. The spirometry was performed according to the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society criteria in a single testing session by trained personnel. Trained staff performed pulmonary function testing and pre-testing education. All flow-volume curves were post hoc inspected for quality assurance by a pediatric pulmonologist. The highest measurement obtained of each lung function parameter from a series of three technically acceptable flow-volume curves was used for statistical analysis. The FVC, FEV1 and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75) were each measured. In addition, we calculated the ratio FEV1/FVC and the standardized z-scored for FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75. We computed the z-scores as the absolute values minus predictive values divided by standard deviation of predictive values.

### Covariates

We selected a priori based on previous studies and directed acyclic graphs using the DAGitty software: maternal smoking status during pregnancy (never smoker, former smoker, and current smoker), maternal highest attained level of education (<11th grade or high school graduate or equivalent, junior college graduate or some college or technical school, college graduate, and any post-graduate schooling) were collected from self-administered questionnaires, maternal age at enrollment (years, continuous) and maternal body mass index (BMI) calculated using maternal pre-pregnancy weight combined with height (kg/m2, continuous) were collected from prenatal medical records.

We had similar results when restricting our analyses to mothers never smoker (Table S2). Findings from the stratified analysis by sex were also persistent but suggested somewhat stronger associations among girls (Figure S3); however, in the overall regression models, the interaction term between child’s sex and maternal urinary arsenic concentrations did not reach statistical significance with a range of p-values from 0.281 to 0.933 (Table S2). We did not observe any clear association between maternal urinary arsenic species concentrations and children’s lung function z-scores in any of the other conducted models using FEV1/FVC as the dependent variable (Table S1).

## Discussion

In this study, we found that maternal gestational urinary arsenic concentrations at levels common to the general US population were associated with reduced children’s FVC and FEV1 z-scores. We also found evidence of potential modification of these effects by maternal methylation capacity and sex-specific effects. A study from Mexico with 358 children of 6–12 years of age exposed to arsenic mainly from drinking water (mean 152.1 μg/L) starting in utero and until early childhood and with an average urinary arsenic of 141.2 μg/L, reported a reduced FVC and FEV1. Higher urinary arsenic concentrations were found among children with restrictive spirometry patterns (prevalence of 57%) compared with children with normal patterns. The MINIMat cohort in rural Bangladesh investigated the association between maternal urinary ΣAs during pregnancy with an average (range) of 76 (2, 2063) μg/L and lung function in 540 9-year-old children. They reported an inverse association with FVC and FEV1 in volumetric units (β = 12; 95% CI from 22 to 1.5 ml, and β = 12; 95% CI from 22 to 1.9 ml, respectively). In our study population, we did not observe an association between arsenic exposure and FEV1/FVC but a reduced FVC and FEV1 supporting potentially restrictive effects on pulmonary airflow. While our analysis was based on z-scores so are not directly comparable, our exposure levels being far lower than Bangladesh resulted in smaller effect sizes compared to those found in children from the MINIMat cohort.

Arsenic can disrupt the highly complex signaling between embryonic lung tissue of mesenchymal and endodermal origin and can permanently alter lung structure and function in experimental studies. In mice, arsenic exposure during pregnancy at relatively low levels (10 and 100 μg/L) from drinking water caused impaired postnatal lung function in particular abnormal stiffening of the lung parenchyma in the offspring, along with impeded development of the distal airways and alveolar tissue. In humans, the lung formation starts with the development of the lung bud from the fetal foregut at 6 weeks’ gestation. Airway generation down to the bronchiolar level are formed by the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. During childhood airways continue to grow, then lung size increases with chest wall growth until adolescence, reaches a plateau at 20–25 years of age and then declines. Failure to reach a normal plateau affects airway function. A prior study suggested sex-specific differences in response to arsenic exposure, such as male mice offspring more susceptible to the effects of arsenic on lung growth and performance than females. However, these lung mechanics alterations were not persistent in adulthood. Our study shows that girls may be more susceptible to the toxic effects of arsenic during gestation on lung function, which could relate to an increased over-expression of genes related to estrogen. We need further studies to understand the mechanisms by which effects of arsenic may manifest differently in males and females.

In humans, there is large inter-individual variation in methylation capacity of iAs and is characterized by the formation of DMA (60–70%) and MMA (10–20%) excreted in urine along with unmetabolized iAs (10–30%). Altered profiles of urinary arsenic species in urine appear to reflect differences in the efficacy of iAs metabolism and are genetically driven. There is evidence that this influences individual susceptibility to the adverse effects of iAs including risks of skin, bladder, and lung cancer among highly exposed populations. In this study, gestational arsenic exposure related to a reduced lung function in the offspring of women with decreased iAs methylation capacity. On average, we observed a 2.6-fold decrease in FVC and FEV1 z-scores in children whose mother had a low SMI compared to those with a high SMI. An earlier study from the MINIMat cohort also found a stronger inverse association between maternal urinary arsenic and children’s FVC and FEV1 among those whose mother had higher percentages of MMA and lower percentages of DMA.

There are limitations in our study. Our study population was healthy overall, and the prevalence of airflow obstruction and restrictive patterns was low. Indeed, <2% of children would be classified with clinical airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC < 0.70) or restrictive (FVC < 80% predicted together with FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.70) patterns. We adjusted our primary models for known risk factors selected from a minimally sufficient set of potential confounders; however, residual confounding is still possible. Therefore, we performed sensitive analysis adding in the models maternal age at enrollment and children’s weight. The results were consistent with those from the main analyses. AsB is a putative non-toxic form of arsenic excreted in the urine unchanged related to fish/seafood consumption, which may cause exposure misclassification of iAs when total urinary arsenic serves as exposure biomarker. In our study population, urinary AsB concentrations with a median < 1 μg/L suggest a limited fish/seafood consumption. However, we measured urinary arsenic speciation and calculated the summation of iAs, MMA and DMA excluding AsB (ΣAs), but did not consider urinary DMA from direct ingestion or from the metabolism of other organo-senical compounds (e.g., arsenosugars and arsenolipids) also related to fish/seafood intake. We used single maternal urine samples; however, urinary arsenic concentrations show temporal stability with consistent patterns of exposure. Our findings suggest sex-related differences in the strength of the effects of gestational arsenic exposure. However, in the sex-stratified analyses we had limited statistical precision, and thus the results need to be interpreted carefully. Also, it is important to recognize that our study did not consider postnatal arsenic exposure, which is expected to be dominated by ingestion of household water and food. Thus, additional studies are needed with repeated postnatal measurements of arsenic exposure.

Our study indicates an association between arsenic exposure at relatively low levels during pregnancy and reduced lung function in childhood that may be important later in life. Additional prospective research is needed to confirm our observations, including potential sex-related and metabolic differences. Our findings support efforts to minimize gestational iAs exposure to reduce the risks of adverse effects on lung formation during this vulnerable window to prevent the potential onset of respiratory diseases throughout the lifespan.
