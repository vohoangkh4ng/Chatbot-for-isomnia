# Title: The effect of prenatal temperature and PM2.5 exposure on birthweight: Weekly windows of exposure throughout the pregnancy

## Summary: This article investigates the impact of prenatal temperature and PM2.5 exposure on term birthweight (TBW) by analyzing data from singleton live births in Massachusetts between 2004 and 2015. The study employs a distributed lag nonlinear model to assess how weekly exposures throughout gestation affect TBW. Findings indicate that higher temperatures and increased PM2.5 levels are associated with lower TBW, particularly during the first and final weeks of pregnancy. The results highlight critical windows of susceptibility to these environmental factors, suggesting the need for targeted interventions to reduce exposure during prenatal care.
