# Title: Environmental Noise and Effects on Sleep: An Update to the WHO Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

## Summary: This article presents a systematic review and meta-analysis updating the World Health Organization's (WHO) evidence on the effects of environmental noise on sleep disturbance. It incorporates recent studies to assess the impact of traffic noise on self-reported sleep quality. The findings indicate a significant association between nighttime noise exposure and sleep disturbance, with moderate quality evidence suggesting that higher levels of aircraft, road, and railway noise correlate with increased sleep disturbance. The study concludes that while the WHO's previous recommendations on nighttime noise levels remain valid, populations exposed to high levels of aircraft noise may be at greater risk of sleep disturbance than previously understood.
