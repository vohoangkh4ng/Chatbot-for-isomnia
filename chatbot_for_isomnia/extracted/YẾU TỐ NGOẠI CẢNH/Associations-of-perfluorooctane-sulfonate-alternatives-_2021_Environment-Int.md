Serum lipids

## Background:
Chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs), a group of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) alternatives, can be widely observed in humans and environmental matrices. However, associations between exposure to Cl-PFESAs and serum lipid levels in adults are unknown.

## Objective:
To explore the relationships between Cl-PFESA levels and serum lipid levels in adults.

## Methods:
We analyzed 1238 adults from the Isomers of C8 Health Project, a cross-sectional study conducted in China from July 2015 to October 2016. The average age of the participants was 61.98 ± 14.40 years. We quantified two select legacy per- and perfluoroalkyl substances [perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and PFOS] and their alternatives (6:2 and 8:2 Cl-PFESAs). We also measured four serum lipids: low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG). We used generalized linear models to estimate the associations between PFASs and serum lipids, with PFASs defined as either a categorical variable divided into quartiles or as a continuous variable.

## Results:
We found that 6:2 Cl-PFESA was positively associated with serum TC and LDL-C. For instance, LDL-C levels in the highest quartile of 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure (Q4) were significantly higher than those in the lowest quartile (Q1) [β: 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08, 0.30]. Further analysis showed that one ln-ng/mL increase in 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure corresponded to a 0.10 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.05, 0.16) LDL-C increase, and that exposure to 8:2 Cl-PFESA was negatively correlated with HDL-C (β: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.01). TC had a similar relationship with both 6:2 Cl-PFESA and legacy PFASs. Participants with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 exhibited a stronger association between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and TC.

## Conclusions:
Our findings make the novel suggestion that exposure to Cl-PFESAs are adversely associated with serum lipid levels, and that such associations are also observed in legacy PFASs. Increased investigation into the effects of Cl-PFESAs exposure on human health is warranted. # Introduction

Dyslipidemia increases the risk of developing many diseases, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of dyslipidemia in Chinese adults is as high as 40.40%, and is gradually increasing. Moreover, dyslipidemia causes the exacerbation of chronic kidney disease, several autoimmune diseases, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Origins of dyslipidemia are multicausal, including genetic, nutritional and other factors. In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated that exposure to environmental pollutants is another pathway underlying the pathophysiology of dyslipidemia.

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been commonly included in commercial products and detected in environmental matrices, wildlife and humans. Prior epidemiological studies have reported inconsistent associations between PFASs and serum lipid levels. In adults, a positive association between PFAS exposure and total cholesterol (TC) was observed to be statistically significant. In addition, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were also associated with PFAS.

In recent years, restrictions have been imposed on PFOS and PFOA production; they have been categorized as persistent organic pollutants due to their toxicity and ability to bioaccumulate. In response, numerous PFAS alternatives have been produced and used. For instance, chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs), a group of PFOS alternatives, use the trade name F-53B and include 6:2 Cl-PFESA and 8:2 Cl-PFESA. These PFOS alternatives have been used in the Chinese metal plating industry since the 1970s as a means to limit the amount of mist produced during the metal plating process and are now known to be readily detectable in human serum, the atmosphere, indoor dust and soil-plant systems. Cl-PFESAs are also more biopersistent than PFOS, with a half-life of 15.3 years, compared to a half-life of 6.7 years. Furthermore, Cl-PFESAs bond more tightly to human serum albumin and bioaccumulate in greater amounts than PFOS. Their health effects are also becoming known, with recent studies in vitro indicating that Cl-PFESAs exhibited hepatotoxicity and animal studies suggesting they disrupt lipid metabolism and are hepatotoxic. Despite these findings, there is a dearth of epidemiological research on the association between Cl-PFESAs exposure and serum lipid levels.

It is within this research context that our objective was formed. Namely, to examine putative associations of two serum Cl-PFESAs with serum lipid levels in humans using data from the Isomers of C8 Health Project in China. Our hypothesis was that exposure to Cl-PFESAs may be adversely associated with serum lipid levels.

# Materials and methods

## Study population

The “Isomers of C8 Health Project” is a cross-sectional study aimed at examining the health effects of PFAS exposure among Chinese residents of Shenyang, the largest industrial city in northeast China, from July 2015 to October 2016. Detailed information about registration and data collection has been described in a previous study. After providing written informed consent, 1276 participants completed questionnaires and provided blood samples. Excluding participants without anthropometric data (n = 38), 1238 individuals were included in the sample for the current study. The “Isomers of C8 Health Project” study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sun Yat-sen University Research Ethics committee (Number: 201401).

## Outcome measurement

The basic components of a clinical serum lipid panel are TC, triglycerides (TG), LDL-C and HDL-C levels. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected, and serum was separated by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min from red blood cells for routine parameters and chilled before being shipped to an analytical laboratory. The TC, TG, HDL-C levels were measured by enzymatic colorimetric methods on the Synchron CX9 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and were measured in mmol/L. LDL-C was calculated using Friedwald formula: LDL-C = TC–HDL-C–TG/5. We measured these components because increased TC, LDL-C, TG and decreased HDL-C could indicate the impairment of lipid functions.

## PFAS measurement

We measured serum PFAS concentrations using a modified version of Benskin et al.’s method. Briefly, serum was prepared for extraction by mixing 2 mL 0.1 M formic acid with 0.2 mL serum and was performed by solid phase extraction. After the addition of 0.5 ng mass-labeled internal standards, the mixture was thoroughly vortexed. The legacy PFAS and the alternatives were separated and quantified using Agilent high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with an Agilent 6495 Triple Quadrupole (QQQ) and a tandem mass spectrometer. All chemical standards were obtained from Wellington Laboratories. The detailed analytic method has been published previously and described in the Supplement Material. In this study, we focused on the two most highly-studied legacy PFASs (PFOA and PFOS), and two alternatives (6:2 and 8:2 Cl-PFESAs). The serum detection rates of these targeted PFAS were 99.92%, 99.92%, 99.92%, and 69.14% respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) for each PFAS was the concentration of each peak analyte level needed to reach a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was defined as the concentration of analyte with the signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1. LOD/√2 was used to replace all serum PFAS concentrations lower than the LOD. We showed detailed information of the LOD and LOQ in Table S2.

## Covariates

We took into account previous studies when constructing our covariates. These covariates mainly included factors capable of affecting both PFAS absorption and metabolism, and serum lipid levels. Covariates included in final models were age (years, continuous), sex (biological male or female), body mass index (BMI, continuous), ethnicity [Han (a majority ethnicity in China) or other], education (<High school or ≥High school), annual household income in Chinese Yuan (<30,000 CNY; 30,000–100,000 CNY; >100,000 CNY), career (officer or others), smoking (dichotomous), alcohol drinking (dichotomous), and regular exercise (dichotomous). We classified annual household income as low income <30,000 CNY, middle income 30,000–100,000 CNY, and high income >100,000 CNY. We also classified BMI as <18.5 kg/m2. |Characteristics|Total (n = 1238)|

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological study to report the associations between Cl-PFESAs and serum lipid levels. In support of the study hypothesis, our findings suggest the adverse associations between PFOS alternatives and serum lipids are similar to those between legacy PFASs and serum lipids. The relationship between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and TC was modified by BMI. Our results indicated that the concentrations of 6:2 Cl-PFESA were positively associated with TC and LDL-C levels, while 8:2 Cl-PFESA was negatively associated with HDL-C levels. Although 6:2 Cl-PFESA and 8:2 Cl-PFESA are very similar in structure, several previous studies also showed they are with different characteristic. For example, Chen et al. found that there was more extent based on 8:2 Cl-PFESA transported across placenta than 6:2 Cl-PFESA. Also consistent with our results, there were positive associations between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and diastolic blood pressure, while no statistically significant associations with 8:2 Cl-PFESA. Similarly, Chu et al. found stronger associations between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and gestational age, while null associations with 8:2 Cl-PFESA. The difference between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and 8:2 Cl-PFESA may be due to the higher hydrophobicity and lower plasma protein binding affinity of the latter. In addition, they may have different exposure-effect thresholds, and different levels in serum.

Although we could not compare the results between Cl-PFESAs and serum lipid levels with other studies due to limited data, many studies have reported on the associations of PFOS and PFOA with serum lipids with inconsistent results. Our findings were consistent with results from previous observational studies.

b P for cross-product term between PFAS × BMI entered into adjusted regression model. demographic, socioeconomic and clinical characteristics. Third, other exposure risk factors could also be associated with blood lipid levels, such as residential greenness. Thus, more exploratory information should be collected and taken into account in the future studies. Finally, the serum 8:2 Cl-PFESA concentrations lower than the LOD were replaced with the LOD/√2. This approach may have biased associations. However, the results were robust even after excluding the substituted values or conducting categorical analyses for 8:2 Cl-PFESA (<LOD and ≥LOD).

## Conclusions

In conclusion, we are the first to report that exposure to Cl-PFESAs is adversely associated with serum LDL-C, HDL-C and TC levels in adults and the associations between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and TC were similar to those between legacy PFASs and TC. We also found that the correlation between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and TC was significantly stronger in the BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 group. In the future, longitudinal research is needed to confirm our results and to provide policy makers with greater information about effects of Cl-PFESAs exposure on human health.
