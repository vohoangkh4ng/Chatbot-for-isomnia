# Title: The relationship between screen time before bedtime and behaviors of preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder and the mediating effects of sleep

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of screen time before bedtime on behavior problems in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and examines the mediating role of sleep. The research involved 358 preschoolers and utilized various assessments to analyze the correlations between screen time, sleep habits, and behavioral issues. Findings indicate that increased screen time before bedtime is associated with negative behavioral outcomes and that sleep partially mediates this relationship. The authors emphasize the importance of educating parents on managing screen time to support the well-being of children with ASD.
