# Title: Urban environment and obesity and weight-related behaviours in primary school children

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between various urban environmental factors and childhood obesity outcomes, as well as weight-related behaviors among primary school children aged 9-12 in Sabadell, Spain. The study, which included 2,213 children, assessed multiple urban exposures such as air pollution, green spaces, and food environments. Results indicated that 40% of the children were overweight or obese, with significant associations found between certain urban exposures and obesity outcomes. Specifically, higher levels of air pollution, road traffic, and a denser unhealthy food environment were linked to increased obesity risk. The findings suggest the need for further longitudinal studies to explore these associations in different contexts.
