Research on mercury (Hg), a naturally occurring element in Earth’s lithosphere, has been extremely hot in the past few decades due to the outbreak of a series of disastrous poisoning incidents. However, such studies might provide us a biased view towards Hg if no thorough review about its long-term effects on living organisms from a multi-timescale perspective was performed. Hg might have played a mysterious role in critical intervals (e.g., mass extinction and oceanic anoxia events) in several geologic periods due to the elevated Hg levels induced by volcanism whereas it has long been used for various purposes in human history. Therefore, it is necessary to go through previous studies and historical records of different timescales (100 to 106 yr). In this work, we conducted a thorough review of Hg knowledge at three different timescales, i.e., geologic periods (106 yr), human history (103 yr), and contemporary history (100 yr), summarizing recent advances and indicated potential research gaps. By doing so, we demonstrated that it is possible to achieve safe and sustainable Hg applications despite the current Hg crisis. However, such silver linings depend on a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Besides, considering the possible dire consequences of erupted Hg levels as suggested in geological periods, swift actions to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the Hg cycle will be another key point. Overall, this review presented a unique perspective of Hg combining different timescales, shedding light on the importance of a better understanding of the global ecosystem as a whole and maintaining the sustainability of planet Earth in the future.

## 1. Introduction

Since the outbreak of Minamata disease and subsequent series of massive mercury (Hg) poisoning incidents, a dramatic amount of attention has been paid to the toxicity of Hg and its potential health risks. In the early to mid-20th century, worldwide applications of Hg become a norm, with the negligence of academics and the general public towards its potential toxicity. This eventually led to a series of disastrous Hg poisoning incidents, which first broke out in Minamata, Japan, and subsequently in other countries such as Sweden and Iraq between the 1950s and 1970s. After that, global concerns have been raised, with numerous studies devoted to this area. There were over 100,000 publications from 1900 to 2019, most of which were published after 1950, especially after 1989. The top 1,000 keywords in all published studies are mostly about Hg accumulation and transformation along with its cycling through the environment, the potential impacts on living organisms, and possible ways to mitigate such impacts.

Into the new millennium, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on the atmospheric cycle of Hg. Hg is a naturally occurring element in Earth’s lithosphere, which can be emitted into the environment mostly by volcanism in Earth’s history. It is also the only metallic element (Hg0) with a liquid form and a high density and coefficient of expansion. As a result, Hg is sensitive to slight changes in temperature and can easily evaporate under standard conditions, forming Hg vapor. This leads to the swift transformation between liquid and gaseous Hg0, enabling the extremely fast Hg cycling through the atmosphere. The lifetime of atmospheric Hg has been estimated to be within 6–12 months, which allows for atmospheric transport on the hemispheric to global scale within a relatively short period of time. Therefore, Hg emitted regionally can readily reach other countries and continents, becoming a global pollution problem, so that no country can solve it alone. To curb such a deteriorating situation, the Minamata Convention on Mercury was signed in Japan in October 2013, focusing on the reduction of Hg emissions.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that the devastating impacts of Hg on the environment have been the only focus of Hg research for decades, which might limit our insights into and thus impair our understanding of Hg as a whole. Hg and its compounds have been known and used in human history for thousands of years for various purposes. For example, elemental Hg and inorganic Hg compounds were commonly used as medicines to treat some diseases, e.g., psoriasis and genital warts, both in the west and in the east. From the viewpoint of the geological timescale, the whole story about Hg might be completely different. Recent studies have revealed that Hg might play a role in the mass extinction events millions of years ago when numerous Hg spikes occurred due to volcanism along several geological periods. Dramatically elevated Hg levels in the environment might even have contributed to mass extinction events. Therefore, the Hg-relevant problems we are encountering nowadays may be either in a worse situation or in a relatively good status, depending on the timescale involved when considering Hg and its impacts on the environment and human society. In both scenarios, the urgent and essential needs are to explore Hg in a broader context rather than narrowing our vision within a relatively short period of time, thus providing pivotal insights into further studies.

Mass extinctions are generally referred to as sharp decreases in biodiversity, speciation, and diversification rate among micro- and macro-organisms.

The number of publications in each year from 1900 to 2019. A, publication number in each year is plotted for the past 120 years, with some key turning points (years) marked on the plotted line. B, publication numbers in each decade are grouped and plotted as proportions of the total number of publications during the past 120 years. Publication data were retrieved from Web of Science with “mercury” as the searching keyword and a timespan of 1900–2019, excluding categories of astronomy and astrophysics. The database was selected as the “Web of Science Core Collection”. There were 108,109 publication records in total. ## 2.1. End-Devonian mass extinction

The Devonian is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic, spanning 60 million years from 419.2 Ma to 358.9 Ma (the beginning of the Carboniferous). The Devonian has also been characterized as a period of global biotic crisis marked by two large extinction pulses: a “Big Five” mass extinction event at the Frasnian-Famennian boundary (FFB; 374 Ma) and the less well-documented Hangenberg event some 15 million years later at the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary (DCB; 359 Ma), i.e., the End-Devonian mass extinction. While the term mass extinction may suggest instant global catastrophe, the End-Devonian mass extinction (including FFB and DCB) took millions of years, which consisted of a series of pulses in climate change, leading to periodic and sudden drops in biodiversity. The possible causes of such mass extinction events have been debating for years, such as asteroid impacts, global anoxia, sea-level changes, and climatic changes, etc.

Similarly, volcanic eruptions can emit extremely high levels of Hg into the environment, which might have played a key role in these mass-extinction events. Nowadays, it has been recognized that volcanic and hydrothermal activities are the main natural sources of elevated Hg in sedimentary rocks. Throughout the Phanerozoic, Hg fallout from large volcanic eruptions is recorded in sediments deposited contemporaneously with most volcanic events. If ancient oceans were like modern oceans, the marine sedimentary successions should represent mostly atmospheric Hg deposited at the ocean surface, which was adsorbed and sedimented by organic matter, sulfides, and other minerals.

Rakociński et al. reported that volcanic-related methylmercury poisoning might be the possible driver of the End-Devonian mass extinction. In their study, anomalous Hg spikes in two marine successions were detected, supporting volcanism as the driving mechanism (ultimate cause) of the end-Devonian Mass Extinction. Moreover, a large amount of MeHg, a strong neurotoxin that bioaccumulates along the food chain, was detected in sedimentary rocks for the first time. As a result, volcanic-driven MeHg poisoning in otherwise anoxic seas could be another proximate (direct) mechanism.

kill mechanism of the End-Devonian Hangenberg extinction (Rakoci´nski et al., 2020). terrestrial plants and animals, which may help explain the co-occurrence of marine and terrestrial extinctions (Grasby et al., 2020).

2.2. End-Permian mass extinction
The End-Permian mass extinction (~252 Ma) is also one of the “Big Five” and is generally regarded as the most severe of all recorded mass extinctions. It has been estimated that ca. 54% of marine families, 68% of genera, and up to 90% of marine invertebrate taxa going extinct in a geologically short time interval. Studies have revealed that enhanced volcanic emissions occurred during the Permian-Triassic transition. As a result, a large amount of Hg was emitted into the surface environment, and thus increase the enrichments of Hg in continental and marine sediments during this period. However, it remains largely unknown whether such spikes could have any significant impacts on living organisms at that time.
To address this problem, Grasby et al. examined the nature of enhanced Hg emissions and the potential impacts it may have had on global ecosystems during the End-Permian mass extinction. Their results indicated that pulses of Hg emissions to the atmosphere would have been orders of magnitude greater than normal background conditions. When deposited in world environments, such high levels of Hg would have generated a series of toxic shocks, each lasting >1000 yr. Reduced ocean pH, increased ocean temperature, and extended anoxic environments would increase microbial MeHg production. Based on such results, they further speculated that terrestrial and marine animals exposed to elevated inorganic Hg and MeHg at high trophic levels could have suffered a variety of adverse effects. Eventually, these repeated Hg loading events would have had severe impacts across marine trophic levels, as well as to be species-specific whereas other species might not experience the same.

### Anthropogenic activities

![A schematic illustration of variations of Hg concentration at different timescales](Fig. 3)
A schematic illustration of variations of Hg concentration at different timescales (the inner circle) linked by global Hg cycling through various environments and interfaces (outer circle). Geological activities can emit high volumes of Hg into the environment but can be offset after a long period (i.e., geological timescale). Therefore, from the viewpoint of human history, the Hg concentrations were reduced dramatically (i.e., blue arrow towards the earth icon); however, due to the increases in anthropogenic emissions, current Hg concentrations have been significantly higher than they were in the past (i.e., purple arrow in the inner circle from the Earth icon). Nevertheless, whether such increases will be continued and their associated consequences from a long-term viewpoint remain unknown.

toxic effects upon the amount of Hg exposure. It should be noted that although microbes capable of methylation did exist during many critical earth intervals, there is a lack of strong evidence of direct involvement of such microbes into Hg methylation at that time, which needs further investigation. More importantly, speculations from the current understanding of Hg toxicology might not be necessarily accurate or applicable to species that lived millions of years ago.

### Hg in human history: Potential benefits

Hg can be found almost everywhere in Earth’s lithosphere. Hg spikes induced by the volcanic eruption that might have caused serious problems to living organisms in various geosocial periods were not observed in the past thousands of years. A significant proportion of Hg, therefore, was naturally stored in heavy-metal-rich geologic deposits and coal. Since antiquity, humans have intentionally (mining) and unintentionally (fossil-fuel combustion) liberated Hg from these stable long-lived reservoirs for various purposes, such as medicinal, industrial, and household applications. Despite a long history of applications, Hg concentrations during the past thousands of years kept relatively low and stable before the 16th century. Therefore, from this point of view, Hg has provided potential benefits in the past few thousand years, bringing wealth, health, and prosperity instead of severe threats to human beings and human society.

#### Elemental Hg

Hg0 has long been used in the mining of precious metals, creating wealth and prosperity for human society. This is because Hg0 can “dissolve” metals, most noticeably precious metals such as silver and gold, forming amalgam, which has been practiced in Asia around 200 BCE, though, as elsewhere, its beginnings are shrouded in legends. The Hg0 in the amalgam then can be removed via evaporation by heating, thus achieving isolation of precious metals, such as gold and silver. As a result, Hg0 has been used for thousands of years to extract precious metals from ores as a stable amalgam. Since Hg0 can be easily obtained and inexpensive, Hg amalgamation had become a widespread technique for gold and silver mining, especially during the Spanish colonial period and the “Gold Rush” era in North America where artisan and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) was popular, creating an enormous amount of wealth for colonizers at that time. ASGM died out in the 20th century due to cost concerns but has been gradually back to operation into the new millennium due to the dramatically increased gold price. Moreover, Hg amalgam has also been frequently used as a dental material to fill cavities caused by tooth decay from the early 19th century onwards due to its strong and long-lasting effects and relatively cheap cost compared with other filling materials.

Applications of Hg0 have expanded into different areas and become prevalent during the past two hundred years due to its unique physical properties, providing huge benefits to human society. For example, electrons in Hg atoms can be excited by a flow of electrons through gases and emit ultraviolet radiation, which then can be used to excite light-emitting phosphors, thus converting electrical energy into visible light. Based on such principles of operation, Hg fluorescent lamps have been invented, improved, and used on a large scale. Hg0 has also been frequently used in many scientific instruments, such as barometers, thermometers, sphygmomanometers. Similar applications of Hg0 can also be found in different industries, including Hg electrodes in chemistry. C. Li et al.

The top 1,000 keywords of all published studies in geosciences relevant to Hg in the past 120 years (1900–2019), with extinction-related keywords labeled in reddish colors in the top middle and enlarged in the top left. 3,603 publication records were retrieved from Web of Science with “mercury” as the searching keyword and a timespan of 1900–2019, excluding astronomy, astrophysics, water resources, and energy fuels. Collected data were analyzed using the built-in function of co-occurrence of keywords plus in VOSviewer. The figure was plotted using “Overlay visualization” in VOSviewer.

A link between each pair of keywords indicates their co-occurrence in particular publications while the link strength indicates the number of times that a pair of keywords have co-occurred in publications. The legend with different colors indicates the average year of the occurrence of each keyword.

Hg0 Other noticeable, although not necessarily beneficial, applications of in human history involve its antibacterial effects. For example, Hg0 was used for medicinal purposes in Europe for centuries, e.g., a treatment for syphilis. Moreover, bodily decay slows down in persons who died from overdosing on Hg0 due to its antibacterial effects. Therefore, it was once strongly believed that Hg0 could lead to prolonged life and even immortality. As a result, large amounts of Hg were used in ancient tombs, leading to abnormally high contents of Hg0 in soils near the tombs. Similar findings were also reported in many pyramids built in ancient Egypt and Mexico.

3.2. Inorganic Hg compounds

Inorganic Hg compounds have also had widespread applications in human society, providing significant benefits to human society. Cinnabar (mercuric sulfide, HgS), from which the free Hg vapor can be obtained by heating in air, is a great example. It is the commonest ore of Hg and had been used as a pigment and ink from ~1100 BCE. The pigment vermilion, made from cinnabar and subsequently produced synthetically from Hg and S was used in Chinese art and lacquerware. In the west, vermilion was also widely used in the art and decoration of Ancient Rome, in the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages, and was the principal red pigment used by European painters during the Renaissance until the 20th century.

Inorganic Hg compounds have also been used as medicines around the world. Cinnabar has been an important traditional Chinese medicine as a sedative and soporific agent for more than 2000 years, roughly at the same time as in the Mediterranean area. Similarly, calomel, i.e., mercurous chloride, was used in traditional Chinese medicine as well as in the West. Prescriptions involving such applications for the treatment of psoriasis, genital warts, and ulcer, etc. have been mentioned in the Ben Cao Gang Mu (Compendium of Materia Medica), a Chinese herbology volume written by Li Shizhen in the Ming Dynasty. Some prescriptions had been frequently used in various remedies in which Hg and its inorganic compounds were effective ingredients. Calomel was also used in Western countries to treat syphilis as a substitute of Hg0 in the 18th century, which stayed in favor as a treatment until the discovery of the anti-syphilitic effects of arsenic in the early 20th century.

The past century has witnessed widespread applications of inorganic Hg compounds in different areas. For example, mercuric chloride has been used as catalysts during C. Li et al.

Fig. 5. A schematic illustrating the cycle of spiked Hg in geological periods, including emissions, transportation, and methylation. Volcanism leads to a series of peak Hg loads to surface water that eventually becomes sequestered to sediments for long-term geologic storage, which can be sustained in the water column over a thousand years. During the whole process, Hg methylation during the Hg cycle plays an important role. Regardless of the Hg source, its high level in the water column, subsequent trapping in sediment and biomethylation to the more toxic MeHg form by anaerobic bacteria, would have had an additional devastating impact on aquatic life during geological periods.

the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) via the calcium carbide process while mercuric sulfate was once used as the catalyst for the production of acetaldehyde. Some inorganic Hg compounds, e.g., mercuric iodide and mercurous chloride are used as effective components of skin lightening products. Besides, the Hg oxide-zinc battery system became a popular power source for portable electronic devices after the Second World War, e.g., watches, cameras, and pacemakers. It has been suggested that natural emission and re-emission have been the major source of Hg emissions. However, widespread applications of Hg and other Hg-related anthropogenic activities over the past few centuries have inevitably accelerated Hg emissions into the environment. Although such spikes might not be comparable to those observed in geological periods, mounting evidence has shown that they have posed severe threats to the living organisms as well as the environment.

### 4. Hg in contemporary history: Severe threats

#### 4.1. Hg spikes in emissions

Hg emission pattern changed dramatically during the First Industrial Revolution, after which significant spikes in Hg emissions occurred. The Spanish America, especially Mexico and Peru, also witnessed a fast growth of Hg emissions due to the increase of Hg-related anthropogenic activities in the great chain of mountain ranges with silver mines stretching from Canada to Chile. These included ore mining, rapid deforestation and depletion of fuelwood, and subsequent separation of precious metals via Hg amalgamation, all of which significantly contributed to Hg emissions. | Time Period         | Event Description                                                                                     |

Fig. 6. A timeline of Hg-related landmark events involving three different timescales. Three different timescales mentioned in this study are presented, including geological periods, human history, and contemporary history. Landmark events within each timescale are listed with a brief introduction and cartoon illustration. Hg might have played a crucial role from the perspective of the geological timescale, contributing to mass extinction events. From the viewpoint of human society, Hg has generated both social and economic benefits for thousands of years, e.g., medicinal and mining applications. However, Hg has caused serious troubles and posed severe threats to human health in the past century.

America became prevalent due to the gold/silver rush in the 1850s. It has been estimated that, in the United States alone, 90% of the production and importation of Hg was consumed by gold and silver extraction between 1850 and 1900, leading to a surge in Hg emissions. The application of Hg amalgamation, however, began to be phased out after the 1880s in favor of cyanidation, a new technique developed in 1887 for extracting gold and silver from low-grade ores. The overall Hg emissions were gradually reduced due to the application of cyanidation in silver and gold mining and sharply plunged because of subsequent two world wars in the 20th century.

However, the following few decades saw an increase in the applications of Hg-containing commercial products. The contribution of Hg-containing commercial products to the overall Hg emissions became obvious after the Second World War. Numerous commercial products were used on a large scale during this period, for example, latex paint, Hg lamps, skincare, and Hg batteries. Besides, new industrial applications of Hg also emerged after the Second World War, e.g., Chlor-alkali and PVC production that involves a large amount of Hg. As a result, high concentrations of Hg were detected in soils, waters, and the air due to the release of Hg from these industrial processes and commercial products.

In the past few decades, a noteworthy change in Hg emissions has been observed with a dominant atmospheric Hg release into the environment. This is mostly due to the consumption of fossil fuels and the rise of Hg amalgamation in the mining industry. Despite the uncertainties in the estimation of Hg emissions, it has been reported that coal combustion, e.g., coal-fired power plants, has contributed significantly to the overall Hg emissions. This is because Hg is naturally abundant in geologic deposits and fossil fuels such as coal. More recently, ASGM has become another major contributor to global Hg emission. It was driven by the dramatic rise in the cost of gold over the past few decades, leading to a gold rush by poverty-driven miners mostly in developing countries. To curb such a dramatic increase in anthropogenically induced Hg emissions, the United Nations Minamata Convention on Mercury was signed in 2013. It has been reported to be promising to reduce global Hg emissions. However, such studies were mostly conducted via model simulation and no case studies of empirical data have been published yet. In this regard, further empirical reports of the impacts of the Convention on Hg emissions will be of great importance to evaluate the effectiveness of these internationally joint efforts and how they can help can positively shape our world.

Hg-induced health risks

After emitting into the environment, Hg, especially MeHg, can be bioaccumulated. MeHg is the only species of Hg to become concentrated within each trophic level along the food chain, reaching extremely high levels in predatory species, e.g., fish. For wild fish, food is the dominant pathway of MeHg uptake, accounting for approximately 80% to 90% of the total uptake while the remaining fraction is attributed to waterborne Hg accumulation. Therefore, Hg levels in fish are about a million times higher than in waters. Many wild piscivorous bird species and mammals also experience extremely high levels of MeHg in their bodies due to their trophic positions and foraging behaviors. Humans, as a result, are inevitably exposed to high levels of MeHg, mostly due to the consumption of fish.

Hg bioaccumulation along the food chain will eventually lead to human exposure, posing severe threats to human health. Humans are primarily exposed to MeHg, mostly from the consumption of various foodstuffs, such as rice, fish, and other seafood, depending on regions. It is well recognized that the consumption of seafood, especially fish, is the predominant pathway of MeHg exposure for most humans. In recent years, studies have revealed that rice consumption also plays a key role in human exposure to MeHg, not only in Asia but also in the rest of the world. This is probably because rice-based products have been increasingly popular in recent years as a major foodstuff globally. Moreover, humans can also be potentially exposed to Hg0 and inorganic Hg by inhalation and direct contact due to the widespread use of Hg-containing products in our daily life, such as skincare products and dental amalgam. Another major exposure pathway is occupational contact. For example, people working in certain industries where elemental and inorganic Hg are commonly used, e.g., medical professionals and miner workers, suffer great risks of Hg exposure.

Exposure to Hg, either elemental, inorganic, or organic, may cause serious health problems, such as cardiovascular, reproductive, and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. The toxic effects of Hg vary with the forms of Hg, the dose, and the rate of exposure. For example, although a small amount of Hg0 is virtually nontoxic, inhalation of a significant amount of Hg0 may induce acute pneumonia. However, chronic exposure, even to low concentrations of Hg0, will lead to absorption and distribution of Hg in all major organs, eventually reaching the brain and causing permanent damage. As for inorganic Hg compounds, upon entering the body, they are accumulated mainly in and produce damage to the kidneys and the intestine but cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, organomercury, e.g., MeHg, is lipid-soluble with an extremely high absorption rate in the gastrointestinal tract as well as through skins and is considered the most hazardous form of Hg. Not only can it damage the intestine and kidneys but also can cross the blood-brain barrier much more efficiently than Hg0.

The toxicity of Hg, however, received little attention until the outbreak of a series of massive Hg poisoning incidents between the 1950s and 1970s. In the past few hundred years, Hg-related anthropogenic activities became prevalent, eventually leading to disastrous poisoning incidents in Japan, Iraq, and other countries around the world between the 1950s and 1970s. The first large-scale poisoning incident occurred in 1956 in Minamata, Japan, resulting in over 1700 deaths due to the consumption of MeHg-contaminated fish. Hg compounds in the sewage water were directly discharged into the Minamata Bay area, subsequently biotransformed and bioaccumulated in fish as MeHg. Residents consuming the contaminated fish developed a series of symptoms, such as numbness, muscle weakness, and damage to hearing, vision, and speech, which is referred to as Minamata disease. Unfortunately, Minamata disease broke out again in a different area called Niigata Prefecture, Japan in 1965. Another major incident that broke out in Iraq in 1971 was the most disastrous. Grains with MeHg as seed coating were imported as seeds but mistakenly consumed by residents in rural areas, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands being affected. Similar incidents were also reported in other countries, such as Sweden, Canada, and the United States.

The mechanisms of Hg toxicity in the body, therefore, have been extensively studied in the past few decades. The toxic effects of Hg can be induced by numerous mechanisms, depending on Hg form and exposure pathways. Once in the bloodstream, Hg0 undergoes catalase- and peroxidase-mediated oxidation in red blood cells and tissues and is transformed into inorganic Hg and HgII. HgII and HgII, either ingested or transformed, have low lipophilicity and thus can barely cross cell membranes. However, HgII in the bloodstream can bind to thiol groups on erythrocytes, glutathione, and metallothionines in plasma, leading to the transportation of the toxin to various organs, including the brain. As for organomercury, MeHg is transported to different organs (ca. 10% to the head region) by binding to thiol groups in blood and tissue protein. Moreover, Hg, both inorganic and organic, can be transported through the placenta and deposited in the fetus, significantly impairing the development of the central nervous system, leading to decrements of intelligence quotient (IQ). Studies have shown that MeHg in the head region is demethylated in glial cells, leading to its breakdown and releasing HgII. Then HgII is moved to neurons and contributes to the MeHg neurotoxicity. The strong affinity of resulting HgII, together with MeHg, to thiol (-SH) groups, also plays a crucial role in the toxic mechanism of Hg.

### Hg in the coming future: Outlook and perspectives

Hg and its related consequences are and no doubt will still be frequently discussed hot topics. Considering such a nature, a comprehensive understanding of Hg from a viewpoint combining a wide range of timescales is crucial. Moreover, the global ecosystem is a dynamic system, and changes in the key components of the system might lead us to a completely different future. Therefore, we thoroughly reviewed previously published articles from a multi-timescale perspective and proposed that the following topics will be of great importance to advance our understanding of Hg.

#### Uncertainties in geological periods

It is clearly shown that Hg can pose severe threats to living organisms.

| Brain | MeHg breaks down in the head region, releasing HgII and leading to MeHg neurotoxicity |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cardiovascular diseases |                                                                 |
| Lungs | Inhalation of a significant amount of HgII may induce acute pneumonia. Chronic exposure will lead to HgII distribution in all major organs. |
| Developmental toxicity | Fetus abnormality and IQ decrements. Inorganic Hg mostly accumulates in and causes damage to the kidneys and intestines. |
| Inorganic Hg | Oxidation from HgII. Low lipophilicity. The main excretory pathways for inorganic Hg include the urine and feces while MeHg is less likely to be excreted. |
| Bladder/rectum |                                                                 |
| Liquid Hg0 | Ready direct contact with high lipophilicity. |
| Gaseous Hg0 | Ready adsorption via inhalation exposure with high lipophilicity. |
| Organomercury | High lipophilicity. MeHg rapidly adsorbs via various tissues. |

A schematic of bioavailability and toxic effects of Hg and its compounds. Elemental Hg (Hg0) is highly lipophilic and thus can be adsorbed easily via direct contact or inhalation. Elemental Hg, once adsorbed, is enzymatically transformed in red blood cells and tissues, which can also be fulfilled by oxidation in the air. Hg and HgII, either ingested or transformed, have low lipophilicity; however, HgII in the bloodstream can bind to thiol groups and thus contribute to the transportation of the toxin to various organs, including the brain. Organomercury, especially, MeHg, combines the toxicities of both Hg0 and HgII. It can cross membranes readily, traveling to different human tissues and organs. Moreover, the breakdown of MeHg in the head can occur, releasing HgII and contributing to the strong neurotoxicity of MeHg. Moreover, inorganic and organic Hg can be transported through the placenta and deposited in the fetus, inducing fetus abnormality and intelligence quotient (IQ) decrements. C. Li et al. Environment International 155 (2021) 106670

nowadays; however, whether it was the case in geological periods needs further exploration. A few pioneering studies have suggested that volcanism emitted a larger amount of Hg to the surface earth, and thus elevated Hg concentrations in both the atmosphere and seawater. As a result, elevated concentrations of Hg (acting as toxic heavy metal) in the surface earth were likely to play a significant role (e.g., toxic effect) to the biota both on land and in the ocean during the mass extinction intervals. Such speculations were based on the findings of dramatically elevated Hg concentrations and subsequently MeHg transformation in marine sediments as well as an observed abnormality of spores in continental sediments. These findings and speculations are still controversial, and we may find out that they are just the tip of the iceberg.

Moreover, the driving forces for microbial transformation between various Hg species (e.g., elemental Hg, inorganic Hg, and MeHg) in Earth history remain unclear. Evolution has been the norm during the past millions of years. Therefore, species might have undergone numerous gene mutations, subsequently evolving and adapting to their living environments. It is reasonable to speculate that specific Hg species might be less toxic or even not toxic at all to some species during those geologic periods, which could be the root cause for microbial transformation of Hg. One more bold speculation is that some Hg species might be beneficial to certain organisms at that time. Supports for such an idea come from studies suggesting that cyanobacteria can act as a proxy or regulator for sites of MeHg production in some natural aquatic environments where MeHg production exhibited a strong positive co-variation with cyanobacteria abundance. It is also possible that the transformation of inorganic Hg to MeHg by some microbes, which could be toxic to their competitors, might help them gain competitive advantages in the long run. Blooming of microbes (e.g., cyanobacteria) were reported during many critical earth intervals (e.g., mass extinction) for the extremely environmental perturbations in marine ecosystems, such as high temperature, eutrophication, and anoxia. The capability of Hg transformation in microbes, together with intense marine environmental perturbations, might significantly contribute to the transformation between various Hg species and thus the turnover of organisms (from metazoans to microbes). Overall, further studies are needed to answer these intriguing questions, which could potentially promote our understanding of the role Hg has played in the evolution, speciation, and extinction along Earth’s history. Particularly, exploring the early history of microbial Hg transformation in geological sample, e.g., Hg methylation/demethylation and Hg reduction/oxidation, could help answer these questions.

## Uncertainties in the future

Given that Hg can pose severe threats to natural environments and human health, together with the significant benefits of Hg applications to human society, we suggest that Hg research in the future should focus on the following topics, i.e., a) safety and sustainability of Hg applications, b) the potential health risks of long-term exposure to low-dose Hg, and c) the potential impacts of increasing anthropogenic activities on the Hg cycle and subsequent consequences.

### Safety and sustainability of Hg applications

A total ban on Hg applications might not be an ideal or the sole solution. Hg has long been used in human history for multiple purposes (e.g., pigment, ink, and thermometers), which has brought convenience to our daily life. However, due to its high toxicity, some Hg-containing products (e.g., thermometers and barometers) have been gradually phased out. Mitigating the potential risks of Hg-containing products and balancing their risks and benefits, in our opinion, might be an alternative that should be taken into consideration in future Hg research. An example is the application of Hg-containing ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). The addition of Hg-containing minerals (such as cinnabar) to various prescriptions is a major feature in TCM for calming nerves and convulsions. Recent studies have suggested that the intake of Hg-containing TCM may pose potential threats to human health, e.g., high blood MeHg levels due to regular ingestion of Hg-containing TCM. Some antibiotics and sedatives that are available in modern medicine today have been developed as an alternative to these traditional medicines. By contrast, some studies demonstrated Hg-containing medicines without appreciable adverse effects and may even exert a possibly beneficial effect on neurocognitive function. Consequently, it is still a controversial topic. Similar to the discovery that the highly toxic arsenic trioxide originally used in TCM is a cure for acute promyelocytic leukemia, safe and sustainable applications of Hg-containing TCM might also be possible. Therefore, further exploration of such possibilities will be of great importance to achieve the balance between risks and benefits and thus the safety and sustainability of Hg applications. Moreover, further exploration of the underlying mechanism may promote our current understanding of Hg toxicity in general.

### Potential health risks of long-term exposure to low-dose Hg

Special attention should be given to the risks of long-term Hg exposure at low doses. Generally, high concentrations of Hg, e.g., occupational exposure, result in acute Hg poisoning that could lead to a variety of symptoms and even death. However, occupational exposure cases reported have been significantly reduced due to the binding of the Minamata Convention and raised public awareness. Instead, emerging evidence indicates that adverse impacts on the neurologic and other body systems due to long-term exposure to low-dose Hg could still be pronounced. For instance, low doses of MeHg exposure can cause hippocampal damage at many organizational levels. When maternal bodies with prenatal exposure to a low dose of MeHg, it would result in intelligence quotient (IQ) decrements in fetuses. It has been estimated that 0.14 points of per-fetus IQ decrements and 7,360 deaths from fatal heart attacks in China were related to the exposure of MeHg at low doses in 2010. Moreover, such potentially adverse impacts of long-term Hg exposure at low doses might differ between populations with various foodstuffs, e.g., fish or rice consumption, and thus could be indirectly affected by many social and economic factors, e.g., income, place of residence, and dietary patterns. Despite advances in assessing the risks of low-dose Hg exposure associated with fish consumption, the importance of various foodstuffs in dietary Hg exposure, as well as the influencing factors, is far from clear, especially at regional scales. As a result, further studies on the risks of Hg exposure may need to shift their focuses on the long-term Hg exposure at low-dose levels and identify the main contributing sources. These would facilitate the establishment of population-specific food consumption advisory, thus mitigating dietary MeHg exposure on a global scale.

### Impacts of increasing anthropogenic activities on the Hg cycle

The impacts of anthropogenic activities might be significant on the Hg cycle, resulting in unexpected consequences. Dramatically increased anthropogenic activities have not only led to spikes in global Hg emissions but also resulted in other significant changes at regional scales as well as on a global scale, such as climate change and glacier melting. Given that Hg spikes induced by natural disasters during geological periods might have involved catastrophic mass extinctions, these significant changes nowadays, if without further interventions, will no doubt alter the global Hg cycle and possibly have severe consequences. For instance, global warming could increase microbial metabolic activity, which may promote the process of microbial Hg methylation and subsequent uptake by other organisms. Meanwhile, the melting of glaciers and the thawing of permafrost are happening at an unprecedented rate due to rising temperatures, releasing contaminants archived in ice for thousands of years, including Hg, to downstream aquatic systems. Moreover, farming activities could also alter global soil ecosystems (e.g., element cycle and soil microbes), microbial MeHg production, and thus MeHg risks. Currently, 11% of the global land area (1.5 billion ha) is in use for the cultivation of crops; as a result, intensive and continuous human activities in farmland could impact the quantity and quality of soil organic matter, with proven effects on Hg methylation by microbes. Similarly, eutrophication, which could be largely attributed to increased human activities and thus nutrient input into lake systems, has recently been reported to increase microbial MeHg production in lake sediments (54–514% higher). These recent findings demonstrate how human activities could impact Hg biogeochemistry and thus its ecological and health risks.

However, the biogeochemistry of Hg at different interfaces is still poorly understood, which renders the accurate estimation of the Hg cycle and subsequent health risks as well as the effectiveness of Hg-related policies extremely difficult. Emitted Hg undergoes both homogeneous and heterogeneous redox reactions in the atmosphere as well as at atmospheric interfaces. Then Hg is deposited to oceans and soils through the surface environments and is eventually buried in ocean sediments or stable terrestrial reservoirs. However, deposited Hg into water and land can be re-emitted back to the atmosphere via reduction and evaporation. For example, Hg deposited on terrestrial plants can be reemitted via Hg redox transformation processes. Moreover, these processes could become even more unpredictable when compounded with various environmental factors such as temperature, pressure, oxygen level, and relative humidity. Although international endeavor has been devoted to reducing Hg emissions, another major uncertainty lies in the connection between Hg emissions and Hg levels in biota, i.e., decreases in Hg emissions would not necessarily lead to lower Hg levels in biota. In some extreme cases, there could be increases in Hg levels in biota in the short term despite decreased Hg emissions. This is because the amount of Hg input via deposition is much lower than that of legacy Hg in the environments and the latter would still be the dominant source for Hg methylation and bioaccumulation. Overall, such uncertainties make it extremely hard to assess the effectiveness of Hg control efforts on mitigating the health risks of the global Hg cycle. There is an urgent need to thoroughly explore Hg transportation processes at various interfaces, building a real-time and precise model system to monitor Hg health risks and adjust policy decisions and prevention measures accordingly.

Taken together, a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics, especially Hg transformation and transportation occurring at various interfaces between different environments, is the key to the estimation and mitigation of the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the Hg cycle. Further work on the mechanisms and timescales of Hg responses to both the direct and indirect impacts posed by anthropogenic activities could provide new insights into the Hg cycle and help policymakers monitor and adapt policies promptly that can effectively reduce Hg emissions at different scales.

## Conclusions

Nowadays, Hg and its compounds are notorious substances due to the outbreak of numerous poisoning incidents in the past few decades. However, Hg, as a natural element, has been in the environment for millions of years. The situation we are facing now might not be the worst-case scenario compared to what it was in the geological periods. Moreover, there is no doubt that Hg will still be with us in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our review that covered different timescales can provide a unique and balanced perspective towards Hg.

It should be noted that there are two sides to every coin, and silver linings could be found amidst this well-known Hg crisis. Despite being a notorious element, Hg has long been used in human history for various purposes due to its intrinsic properties, most of which have been abandoned or banned. There is no doubt that hazardous Hg applications should be banned but such a ban should not be biased, or panic-driven. Currently, a few applications are still in use although less frequently compared to what they were in the past (e.g., medicinal applications) since the Minamata Convention has given exemptions to Hg-containing products or practices due to traditional or religious considerations. However, whether to ban such applications completely is still a frequently discussed topic. On contrary to the general belief, in our opinion, it is possible to achieve safe and sustainable Hg applications, such as Hg-containing TCM, similar to the inspiring discovery of the highly toxic arsenic trioxide originally used in TCM being a cure for acute promyelocytic leukemia.

The importance of treating the global ecosystem as a whole should also be highlighted. Recent advances in geological studies using fossil evidence and modeling methodology have suggested that Hg might have played an important role in mass extinctions by disturbing the global Hg cycle via volcanism. Despite being preliminary findings, they indeed deliver an informative message that the impacts of anthropogenic activities might be significant on the Hg cycle since any they could lead to chain reactions to the global ecosystem. If such changes induced by anthropogenic activities keep deteriorating (e.g., climate change and glacier melting), unexpectedly huge amounts of Hg stored in terrestrial and marine reservoirs might be released into and cycle through the environment. This might create a scenario that natural Hg emissions could easily outweigh human contribution to the global Hg emissions, voiding all the efforts we have made so far.

Therefore, we should start acting accordingly now to foster a better understanding of Hg-related ecosystem dynamics (e.g., Hg cycle and associated immobilization of the mobilized Hg at different timescales) and mitigate both the direct and indirect impacts of anthropogenic activities on the Hg cycle. Academics and policymakers, as well as the general public, must learn from the past and adapt research directions and environmental policies promptly to help build a better future altogether. C.
