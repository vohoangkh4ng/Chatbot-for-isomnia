# Title: Building Personal Learning Environments by using and mixing ICT Tools in a professional way

## Summary: This paper discusses a teaching experience focused on integrating ICT tools into higher education, emphasizing the development of Personal Learning Environments (PLEs). It highlights a naturalistic study that involved hands-on sessions to familiarize students with specific ICT tools, fostering awareness of their PLEs. The findings indicate that while students appreciate innovative approaches to learning, many lack prior experience with ICT tools and do not recognize their potential for educational use. The study reveals that students have a basic understanding of their PLEs, with few making complex connections between tools, tasks, and their learning processes.
