# Title: Treatment Utilization Pattern of Preschool Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

## Summary: This study aims to identify treatment patterns for preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD, analyzing a nationwide sample of nearly 24,000 children over the past six years. The findings reveal that one in three preschoolers with ADHD were prescribed psychotropic medications, primarily methylphenidate and guanfacine, with a notable trend of starting medication before psychotherapy. The study highlights an increase in treatment rates, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, but notes inconsistencies with care guidelines that recommend therapy prior to medication. Factors such as comorbid psychiatric disorders and sleep problems significantly influenced treatment selection.
