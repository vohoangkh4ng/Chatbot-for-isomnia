# Abstract:
**CONTEXT:** Academic stress among adolescents is a significant contributor to a variety of mental and behavioral disorders. Holistic stress management interventions equip adolescents with good mental health and improve academic performance.
**AIM:** The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of holistic group‑based stress management program in reducing academic stress, depression, anxiety, and improving well‑being among adolescent girls.
**SETTINGS AND DESIGN:** Randomized control trial was adopted and the study was conducted at selected colleges of Dharwad city, Karnataka, India.
**MATERIALS AND METHODS:** Two hundred and thirty adolescent girls were randomly selected and assigned to either experimental (n = 115) or control group (n = 115). Both group participants were initially assessed for academic stress, depression, anxiety, general stress, and well‑being. The experimental group participants participated in eight sessions of holistic group‑based stress management program over a period of 1 month. The intervention comprises of body–mind–spirit strategies focusing on techniques to handle stressful situations, accept responsibility for their own well‑being, and take charge of self‑health. Control group participants did not receive any intervention. Postintervention assessments were conducted for all the participants on monthly intervals for 6 months.
**RESULTS:** Over 6 months follow‑up compared to control group, the experimental group participants showed statistically significant decrease in academic stress (F = 131.60, P < 0.01, n²G = 0.14), depression (F = 156.70, P < 0.01, nG = 0.13), anxiety (F = 190.50, P < 0.01, nG = 0.16), general stress (F = 166.10, P < 0.01, nG = 0.16), and improvement in well‑being (F = 156.40, P < 0.01, nG = 0.13).
**CONCLUSIONS:** These findings indicate that holistic stress management program has a positive effect on reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and improving well‑being.

# Introduction
Adolescence is a period marked by rapid physical, emotional, and social changes. It is a major transitional period between childhood and adulthood. Adolescents (aged from 10 to 19) account for approximately 17% of the world’s population. India accounts for 21% of the adolescent population worldwide. Stress is a common experience during this adolescent Rentala, et al.: Holistic group‑based stress management program for adolescent girls

In the various studies that have focused on stress, the adolescents have indicated several sources of stress including: school, friends, family, and lack of interest in education and the future. Among these sources, adolescents reported school work as the most frequent source of stress. They specifically reported about examination and grade worries, fear of success or failure, test or performance anxiety, acceptance by teachers, and looking toward the future.

Various studies conducted among adolescents in Asian countries identified a significant relationship between academic stress and mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal behavior. Chronic or unmanaged stress can cause difficulties in development and lead to long‑term setbacks in physical and mental health. Distressed teens are at higher risk for anxiety disorders, depression, behavioral problems, and suicide. Adolescent stress levels have been associated with risky sexual behavior, smoking, substance abuse, self‑harm, and poor eating habits. Anxiety and mood disorders are among the more common emotional disorders in youth. Although anxiety and depression affect boys and girls almost similarly, adolescent girls are much more vulnerable to stress when compared to adolescent boys due to inherent physiological changes, their social upbringing, and a feeling of greater pressure to achieve good academic grades at an early age. Furthermore, depression is more common among adolescent girls. Self‑reported mental and subjective health complaints such as pain, sleeping problems, anxiety, and various stress‑related problems seem to have increased over time among older adolescents, especially girls. There is a negative relationship between adolescent depressive symptoms and educational achievement. Improving school achievement and emotional well‑being seem to play an essential role.

One of the ways to deal with stress is to conduct stress management programs. This can be done by training the adolescents to identify ways to tackle problems. The implementation of stress management strategies such as deep breathing, progressive muscular relaxation, and positive self‑talk at this stage are not only relevant to manage stress at a very young age but also very significant in improving school achievement and emotional well‑being among adolescents. Although school programs targeting stress management are effective in reducing stress among children, only a few cater specifically for adolescent girls.

As stress can affect health, emotional state, and academic performance, it is important that students develop effective strategies to manage stressful situations. The present‑day adolescents need psychological treatment to develop positive lifestyle with healthy coping mechanisms. Rentala, et al.: Holistic group‑based stress management program for adolescent girls

Holistic stress management intervention empowers the academically stressed adolescents. The techniques used in BMS‑based stress management program aid the individual in developing insight into their behavior and thought process, which in turn aid in handling potential triggers. Furthermore, this holistic approach helps the adolescent girls to accept responsibility for their own well‑being and take charge of self‑health. This holistic intervention is much better than single module complementary and alternative or conventional therapies.

The rationale is that teaching adolescents stress management skills during this important developmental period may reduce the frequency and severity of stress‑related mental and physical health issues. In additional, adolescents may learn holistic techniques to handle stress which might increase their emotional and social abilities with potential benefit to academic outcomes.

### Eligibility requirements
The age inclusion criteria were 16–19 years and the study excluded participants who had undergone or were undergoing other forms of counseling or relaxation therapies (psychological counseling and or any other stress reduction programs) and also having a significant medical or psychiatric condition that could interfere with their participation in the proposed therapy.

### Study design and data collection procedure
This study utilized experimental pre‑ and post control group design with 6‑month follow‑up. Participants were randomized into experimental or control group. Initially, the data collector approached each participant and assessed them for baseline data using self‑report methods such as sociodemographic data sheet; personality inventory; IQ assessment; Educational Stress Scale for Adolescents; Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale‑21 (DASS‑21); and BMS Well‑being Scale. Control group participants did not receive any intervention. Experimental group participants participated in holistic group‑based stress management program.

### Intervention
The intervention involved a total of eight sessions, with 2 weekly sessions for 4 weeks; each session lasting for 90–120 min. Intervention was given as a group approach by the first author who underwent BMS practitioner training at center on behavioral health, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Each group consisted of 8 to15 participants. A total of 13 groups completed the 4‑week intervention. The holistic stress management program was based on BMS model originally developed by Chan et al. which emphasizes a holistic concept of health. This model focuses on establishing a dynamic balance of interrelationships among mind, body, and spirit through psychoeducation strategies on emotional management, stress reduction techniques such as acupressure exercises, breathing techniques and meditation, connecting to spiritual and self‑healing resources like utilizing strengths, and appreciating abilities.

In the present study, holistic stress management program was implemented over eight sessions:
(a) concept of holistic health;
(b) understanding my own stress;
(c) identifying stressors;
(d) how do I respond to stress;
(e) emotions and well‑being;
(f) loving myself; Rentala, et al.: Holistic group‑based stress management program for adolescent girls

Postassessment
Postassessment was done using same measures at the end of 1st‑, 2nd‑, 3rd‑, 4th‑, 5th‑, and 6th‑month intervals. During each follow‑up, the experimental group participants were encouraged and reinforced to practice holistic techniques along with routine follow‑up assessments, whereas the control group participants had only follow‑up assessments without any intervention.

Measures
The participants responded to the Educational Stress Scale for Adolescents, DASS‑21, BMS Well‑being Scale, and Eysenck’s personality inventory and IQ assessment. The outcome measures were assessed at baseline (T0) and at six follow‑up assessments, namely 1st month (T1), 2nd month (T2), 3rd month (T3), 4th month (T4), 5th month (T5), and 6th month (T6).

1. DASS‑21 was developed by Lovibond and Lovibond in 1995. It is a short version of the 42‑item self‑report instrument consisting of three seven‑item subscales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. Each scale includes seven items, with a total of 21 items rated on four‑point scale ranging from 0 to 3 (0 – denoting did not apply to me at all and 3 – denoting applied to me most of the time). The overall scores for the three subscales are calculated as the sum of scores for the relevant seven items multiplied by two. The Cronbach’s alpha for stress subscale is 0.77, depression 0.77, and anxiety 0.80 among adolescents.

2. Education Stress Scale for Adolescents was developed by Sun et al. (2011). It is a self‑report instrument containing 16 items designed to measure educational stress on five components: pressure from study (4 items), workload (3 items), worry about grades (3 items), self‑expectation (3 items), and despondency (3 items) rated on five‑point scale 1–5 (1 – strongly disagree to 5 – strongly agree) with higher score indicating greater educational stress. # Holistic group‑based stress management program for adolescent girls

Scores range from 16 to 80. The Cronbach’s alpha for the total 16‑item ESSA scale was 0.81, 0.74, 0.71, 0.66, and 0.75 for the five factors, respectively, indicating moderate‑to‑good internal consistency among East Asian adolescents

3. BMS Well‑being Inventory (BMSWBI) – It is a 56‑item (of which 30 are negative), 11‑point multidimensional inventory for assessing holistic health; negative items are scored in the reverse direction with higher scores indicating better health. It comprises of four subscales: physical distress – 14 items, daily functioning – 10 items, affect – 19 items, and spirituality – 13 items. The alpha coefficients of the BMSWBI ranged from 0.87 to 0.92.

## Data analysis

Data were analyzed using R version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for statistical computing, Venna, Austria, 2018) statistical package, results were presented in a table form. Baseline characteristics of the experimental and control groups were compared using one‑way ANOVA or independent t‑tests or 2 test. The changes in the outcome variables from baseline to 6‑month follow‑up were compared using Univariate Type III Repeated‑Measures ANOVA.

## Results

### Preintervention comparison

At preintervention level, both the groups were equal in sociodemographic and educational variables, except in Rentala, et al.: Holistic group‑based stress management program for adolescent girls

birth order, personality, and father education [Table 2]. Both the groups were similar in all the outcome variables except in general stress [Table 3].

Intervention effects

Univariate Type III Repeated‑Measures ANOVA was conducted to identify the variation in the outcome variables from baseline to 6 months follow‑up [Tables 4 and 5]. Compared to the control group, the experimental group showed statistically significant decrease in educational stress (F(6,1188) = 131.60, P < 0.01, nG = 0.14), depression (F(6,1212) = 156.70, P < 0.01, nG = 0.13), anxiety (F(6,1230) = 190.50, P < 0.01, n2G = 0.16), general stress (F(6,1236) = 166.10, P < 0.01, n2G = 0.16), and well‑being (F(6,1200) = 156.40, P < 0.01, n2G = 0.13). The calculated effect size was consistently large for all the outcome variables in experimental group participants compared to control group participants.

Discussion

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of holistic stress management program in promoting mental health outcomes among adolescent girls. The study was based on theoretically oriented and culturally sensitive holistic program, where in experimental group subjects participated in 4‑week stress management program. Participants’ scores on different outcomes of mental health before and after the intervention were analyzed using appropriate statistical techniques. The results suggest astounding effects of holistic stress management program favorably improving well‑being, reduction in depression, anxiety, and academic stress. The results indicated that the effect continued and persisted even after 6 months. This suggests that a holistic stress management intervention approach can facilitate well‑being among educationally stressed adolescent’s girls.

In this study, educational stress decreased considerably among experimental group participants than in control group participants at 6 months follow‑up. Reported efficacy of holistic stress management for promoting mental health in adolescents is in line with the findings of previous studies. Kang et al. 2009 conducted a stress coping program based on mindfulness meditation on the stress, anxiety, and depression among nursing students. Results showed that mindful‑based stress management programs were effective in reduction of stress, anxiety, and depression. Yogic lifestyle activities helped participants to not only deal with the problems at hand but also nurture the self and enhance their self stress management.

The present study findings showed that there was a statistically significant decrease in depression and anxiety scores of experimental group participants compared to control group participants. This reduction continued for 6 months demonstrating holistic stress management can improve positive emotions among adolescent girls. Notwithstanding these limitations, it is a maiden study to demonstrate the effectiveness of holistic stress management program in improving mental health outcomes among Indian adolescent girls who are educationally stressed. | Time of assessment | Experimental group (n=108) | Control group (n=101) | Mean±SD | Group × time F | P | Partial ‑ eta squared (nG)2 |
