# Title: Effect of Topical Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) Seed Oil on Childhood Sleep Disorders: a Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Trial

## Summary: This study investigates the efficacy of topical lettuce seed oil in treating sleep disorders in children aged 3-6 years. Conducted as a double-blind randomized controlled trial, the research involved 72 participants who were assigned to receive either the lettuce seed oil or a placebo. Results indicated significant improvements in various sleep-related issues, such as bedtime problems and excessive daytime sleepiness, in the intervention group compared to the control group. The findings suggest that topical application of lettuce seed oil may be a safe and effective treatment for childhood sleep disorders, although further research with larger samples and objective measures is recommended.
