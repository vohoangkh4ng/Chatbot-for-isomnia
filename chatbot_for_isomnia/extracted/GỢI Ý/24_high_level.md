# Title: A Single Arm Pilot Trial of Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Adolescents with Physical and Psychiatric Comorbidities

## Summary: This study investigates the preliminary efficacy of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention in adolescents suffering from insomnia alongside physical and psychiatric comorbidities. The trial involved 40 adolescents who underwent four treatment sessions, with assessments of sleep quality, psychological symptoms, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) conducted before, immediately after, and three months post-treatment. Results indicated significant improvements in insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and psychological well-being, suggesting that CBT-I is a promising intervention for this demographic. Future randomized controlled trials are recommended to further evaluate the long-term effects of CBT-I in adolescents with comorbid conditions.
