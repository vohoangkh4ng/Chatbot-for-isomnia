# Title: Efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy in children and adolescents with insomnia: a systematic review and meta-analysis

## Summary: This article presents a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) in children and adolescents. The study highlights the high prevalence of insomnia in this demographic and its association with various psychological issues. The authors conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases to identify relevant studies, ultimately including ten trials with 464 participants aged 5 to 19. The findings indicate that CBT-i significantly improves sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency, although no significant effects were observed for wake after sleep onset or total sleep time. The results suggest that CBT-i may be an effective treatment option for insomnia in children and adolescents.
