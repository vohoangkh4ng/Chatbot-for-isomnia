# Title: Light-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for sleep and fatigue: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial during chemotherapy for breast cancer

## Summary: This article presents a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effects of combined cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and bright light therapy (BLT) on insomnia, fatigue, and mental health in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. The study addresses the high prevalence of sleep disturbances in this population and aims to improve their quality of life through a structured intervention. Participants will be recruited from a cancer center in Melbourne, Australia, and outcomes will be measured at multiple points over six weeks, with follow-up assessments at three months.
