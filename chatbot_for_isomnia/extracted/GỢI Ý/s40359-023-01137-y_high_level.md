# Title: Chinese school adolescentsâ€™ stress experience and coping strategies: a qualitative study

## Summary: This study investigates the stress experiences and coping strategies of high school students in China, highlighting the significant stress they face primarily due to academic pressures, peer relationships, and family issues. The research, conducted through focus group interviews with students and teachers, identifies four key themes: sources of stress, impacts of stress, coping strategies, and recommendations for stress management. Findings reveal that students often resort to avoidant coping strategies, which are deemed ineffective in the long term, indicating a need for improved coping skills training and interventions to enhance mental well-being among adolescents.
