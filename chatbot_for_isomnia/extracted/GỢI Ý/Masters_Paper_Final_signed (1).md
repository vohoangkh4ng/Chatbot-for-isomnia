Second Reader Abstract
The following paper is a literature review of stressors in adolescence, the effects of stress on adolescents and academic stress in adolescence conducted to inform BeWell Health and Wellness’ creation of an academic stress reduction curriculum for high school students engaged in an after school academic enrichment program in New York City called BridgeUP. The role of stress in an adolescent’s life and the long-term implications found during an examination of the literature supported the concept of developing a curriculum rooted in a social-emotional learning framework that teaches skills around time management, organization and study skills. # Table of Contents

Adolescence is marked as a time of great change. Changes in an adolescent’s mind and/or body coupled with any changes in his/her familial make-up, environment, school life, social relationships, political climate and more can create undue stress. Once an adolescent reaches high school age, they may experience increased autonomy, increased abstract thought, beginning of identity development, beginning of romantic relationships, greater focus on social groups, renegotiation of familial relationships, and preparation for college or a career; these are all potential sources of stress. Being an adolescent is not the only identity one has during this period. Just as in later periods of development in life, there is the intersection of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, country of origin, and socioeconomic status to name a few. The complications that can come with those other intersecting identities can bring additional stress to an adolescent’s life. Adolescent rates of reported overall stress surpass those of adults. Among adolescent stressors, academic stress may be especially important. Persistent stress can lead to negative health outcomes and negatively impact academic performance; therefore, a proactive approach to reduce scholars’ stress and increase organizational skill sets will prove beneficial. Studies have shown that teaching youth appropriate ways to prepare psychologically can lower their anxiety, allowing them to learn more in the classroom, and in some cases, reduce racial and gender achievement gaps. Along with anxiety, academic stress is associated with depression among adolescents and negatively impacts their overall life satisfaction. BridgeUP is an after school academic enrichment program that aims to help teens in New York City boroughs of Bronx and Manhattan reach their full academic potential and go on to study in college or begin a career. There is an application process for any students who attend high school in Manhattan or Bronx. Accepted high school students, known as BridgeUP scholars, receive mentorship, academic support, and have access to engaging learning opportunities with a group of likeminded students. BridgeUP scholars gain valuable knowledge and opportunities throughout their time with the program, helping to foster academic independence, critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity. The program’s goal is to aid in bridging the gap between resources and opportunity for underserved youth in the Bronx and Manhattan.

To mitigate the impact of stress on the overall health and academic performance of BridgeUP scholars, BeWell developed an academic stress reduction curriculum which focuses on teaching organizational skills and stress reduction techniques to scholars and incentivizes regular practice of skills falling into the categories of time management, organization, and study techniques. BeWell Health & Wellness is a health education and wellness support program developed by Columbia University’s Harlem Health Promotion Center. BeWell provides health and mental health education and supportive counseling to help foster health awareness and healthy choices for BridgeUP youth and their families. BeWell also provides BridgeUP staff, scholars and their families with health education trainings on a variety of topics, including stress reduction, nutrition, sexual education, healthy relationships, sleep and exercise. BeWell’s role is also to provide support by creating linkages to community resources near library sites for easier access by BridgeUP staff, scholars and families.

Time management is a crucial skill BeWell has chosen to teach to reduce academic stress. Students with poor time management skills often find that their self- esteem, relationships, academic performance and health are negatively affected as a result. Along with time management, BeWell found through research that it would be equally beneficial to also incorporate organization and study techniques. Teaching adolescents how to properly prepare for academic challenges, such as exams, can help reduce pressure, anxiety and stress on students, improving their working memory and academic performance. By incorporating organizational skills and study techniques into the academic stress curriculum, students will be able to better prepare for their academic workload, reducing the risk of negative impacts on anxiety levels and overall cognitive functioning. These organizational and stress reduction skills fall within the social-emotional learning framework, allowing scholars to build skills in responsible decision making, self-awareness, and self-management. The social-emotional learning (SEL) framework is the method through which learning to recognize and manage emotions, care about others, make good decisions, behave ethically and responsibly, nurture positive relationships and avoid negative behaviors is developed. BeWell and BridgeUP agree that the skills addressed in the SEL framework will not only help the scholars to be successful in reducing their academic stress but also to successfully complete their lifetime goals. Therefore, this is the framework through which any curriculum is created at either organization.

The purpose of this paper is two-pronged. First, this paper will provide illustrative literature on common stressors – including academic stressors -- for adolescents, and the effects of stress on adolescents that informed the reasoning behind the development of the academic stress reduction curriculum. Second, this paper will describe the academic stress reduction curriculum developed in the summer of 2018 by the author and BeWell Health and Wellness staff for the New York City youth involved in the BridgeUP after school academic enrichment program. The author contributed to the development of the academic stress reduction curriculum through research of literature showing the effects of stress, more specifically academic stress, and how time management, organization and study skills can reduce stress in adolescents. The search garnered literature supporting the creation of the academic stress reduction program by showing the negative effects of stress on adolescents and their long-term implications. The author assisted in creating a proposal, using the information found through research, for an academic stress curriculum, including a sample lesson plan that was presented by BeWell staff to BridgeUP’s Director of Education for approval to move forward in implementing the curriculum with scholars during the 2018-2019 academic year. Once the proposal was approved, the author worked with BeWell staff to draft 18 lesson plans for the pending academic year. The projected lesson schedule for this academic year can be found in Appendix A and the lesson plans for the Fall semester can be found in Appendix B.

Background

There has historically been an abundance of studies on stress in the adult population, but less focus on adolescence. However, the body of work on stress in adolescents recently has been growing so as to better understand its long-term outcomes. The evolution of research on stress can be traced back to the mid-1800s and the knowledge surrounding it continues to grow. Early research and observations of French physiologist Claude Bernard and American physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon uncovered the inner workings of the human body that were later coined as physiological stress responses. The technical and original definition of stress comes from physics and is “A force exerted on a material that causes strain or deformation.” It was not until 1926 that the term stress was applied in a human sciences context. Hans Selye began to define stress as the “sum of all unspecific changes (within an organism) caused by function or damage.” The term eventually evolved into the definition used by most professionals today, which is “the physiological changes in your body due to external factors that are perceived as threatening harm, loss, or misfortune, or as demanding more than you have in resources and capabilities.”

Stress is the body’s way of reacting to any perceived demand or threat. The body protects itself by releasing a combination of adrenaline and cortisol into the bloodstream. As these hormones are released one’s heart beats faster, blood pressure rises and breathing speeds up. If this stress response is triggered by a physical danger these chemicals can be beneficial as they increase strength and energy, enable faster reaction times and enhance focus. But if the stress is caused by something emotional, the effects can be harmful as there is no outlet for this extra energy and strength. Chronic states of stress create depleted energy, obsessive behaviors, and other health issues due to the signals consistently being sent to release the chemicals. Continually living in a state of stress will have a negative effect on the brain, digestive system, immune system and reproductive system. Long-term activation of the stress response system can cause anxiety, depression, digestive issues, heart problems, headaches, sleep issues, weight gain and memory issues. This damage in the developing body of an adolescent has long-term, sometimes irreversible, implications leading to a lower quality of life. ## Literature Review and Search Criteria

The following literature review assesses findings of the association between stress and adolescent academic outcomes to inform the future development of the stress reduction curriculum later developed by the author and BeWell staff members. Search strategies were developed with assistance from a librarian from the UNC Health Sciences Library. UNC Articles Plus and Google Scholar search engines were used in August, September and October of 2018, to include the following databases: World CAT, PubMed and PsychInfo. Search terms included “common stressors,” “stress outcomes,” “coping with stress,” “academic stress,” “manifestation of stress,” “effects of stress,” “symptoms of stress,” “coping with stress,” and “school-related stress” combined with “adolescents,” “adolescence,” “youth”, “teenagers,” and “young adults.” The multiple combinations of these terms produced thousands of results; from these the author first selected literature based on the relevance of the title. Next the author examined the abstracts, if available, to determine if the articles conducted studies or reviewed additional literature around stress and its effects on adolescents. After the selection of relevant stress and academic stress articles, articles incorporating the following terms were also included into article selection: health outcomes, academic outcomes, risk behaviors, mental health, or adolescent health. Articles were considered relevant by the author if they focused on the mental health of adolescents as it related to stress. Articles were included if they focused on a representative sample of adolescents, when applicable, in urban areas. Additionally, the literature chosen for the review included scholarly articles written by individuals with credentials relating to adolescent health. Articles with only middle school or elementary aged youth were excluded, as this specific subcategory of youth was outside of the scope of this literature review. The following diagram depicts

the article identification and selection process.

The resulting search included 44 articles from the following journals (not an exhaustive list): The Journal of School Health, The Journal of Adolescence, The Journal of Contemporary Educational Psychology, The Journal of Adolescent Research, Procedia - The Journal of Social and Behavioral Science, The Journal of Children and Youth Services Review, The Lancet, The Journal of Indian Pediatrics. The following section reviews and/or summarizes some of the articles with relevance to adolescent Common Stressors for Adolescents

To reduce the effects of stress on adolescents through teaching them techniques to manage it, there needs to be a level of understanding of the causes of stress in adolescents. Stark, Spirito, Williams, and Guevremont set out to study the common problems among adolescents aged 14 to 17 years old in 1989. Their study was designed to not only look at the problems of adolescents but to go further to uncover adolescents’ strategies of coping with their problems if applicable. The researchers chose to analyze the data by gender to see if there were any significant differences between female and male participants. They gathered their sample of participants from 10 local Providence, Rhode Island high schools and ended with a sample that was comprised of 75% white adolescents and 25% minority adolescents. The sample was illustrative of the ratio of inner city vs. suburban areas, socioeconomic classes and genders. To generate a list of common stressors, the researchers reviewed the qualitative answers individuals gave to questions about problems they had encountered in the previous month that may have resulted in their stress. Key terms were pulled out to create the general categories of school-related stress, parents, boyfriend/girlfriend, friends, family, concerns about death, job/money, concerns about the future and existential concerns. The results of this study were that females appeared to report more interpersonal stress where males reported more school related stress. When results were further analyzed by age within gender, it was found that younger age groups reported stress around school or parents and the older age groups showed an increase in stress around money and the future. Authors Denise E. LaRue and Judith W. Herman presented an adolescent perspective on stress after conducting a literature review and subsequent study. The literature showed sources of stress for adolescents over the previous years mirrored some of those found in the 1989 article including school, family, home life, neighborhood, social status (race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status), unintended accidents, pregnancy, and relocation. Their qualitative study found similar results of points of stress including school, money, relationships, and parents. The sources of stress had not changed much over the span of 20 years.

Another article reported that adolescents will place a high value on their social lives. They spend most of their waking hours among their peers. This translates to stress of finding and keeping their friends. That same article reported that stress tends to have a trickle-down effect, and it further explained the intricacies of family problems as stressors for adolescents. Unrealistic expectations, marital problems, strained sibling relationships, illness in the family, and financial stress on the family can all trigger a spike in an adolescent’s stress. Additionally, today’s youth live in a 24-hour news circuits era with so much technology at one’s fingertips. With the non-stop exposure to menacing news, adolescents are regularly subject to news regarding school shootings, acts of terrorism, and natural disasters leaving them consistently wondering about their safety and the safety of their loved ones.

A survey conducted with adolescents showed parental divorce, newly blended families, and changing schools or homes as additional examples of prevalent stressful life events in the lives of adolescents. It also pointed to daily stressors that do not necessarily relate to a specific event such as difficulties in relationships with boy/girlfriends, friends, schoolwork, weight, and health problems. Both stressful life events and daily stressors are associated with negative impacts on mental health, the onset of illness and the exacerbation of chronic illness

The scholars in the BridegUP program are in New York City; therefore, it would be remiss to overlook the exposure to stressors that have been linked to living in urban areas. Landis et al. recognized that noise, crowding, and environmental toxins are stressors for individuals living an urban lifestyle but if an adolescent also lives in poverty, urban living can bring about additional stressors such as money issues, evictions, dilapidated housing, inadequate healthcare, ineffective schools, and disruptions to important services. This category of stressors tends to be out of an adolescent’s control, potentially adding a layer of hopelessness to his/her already demanding social and academic load. The article details additional points of stress an adolescent may be at risk for if they live in poverty, such as physical abuse in the home or bearing witness to violence in the community

The Center for Adolescent Health, a center that works out of the Department of Population, Family, and Reproductive Health in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, recognized that stress is not only felt by adults, but also children who face challenges in life that lead to stress. The Center for Adolescent Health created a guide for those working with or raising adolescents to reference when helping them deal with stress. In developing this guide, the Center for Adolescent Health conducted in-depth interviews, administered questionnaires and collected tape-recorded journals of adolescents to obtain their views on what it is that causes them stress. Data were collected from 14 and 15-year-old African American teens living in Baltimore City. The results showed that school work (78%), parents (68%), romantic relationships (64%), friends’ problems (64%), and younger siblings (64%) were the top five stressors for the participants. Additionally, it was shown that the female participants experienced stress more than male participants. After further analysis of gender differences, it was found that female participants attributed most of their stress to their relationships with boys and their friendships with other girls, while male participants reported difficulties with authority.

Using data collected by the American Psychological Association for the Stress in America Survey, author and therapist Kathleen Smith identified common adolescent stressors in her article on a website founded by a psychiatrist and clinical psychopharmacologist to provide mental health information to better inform patients and the healthcare professionals treating them. Smith states as recently as 2018, academic stress, social stress, family discord, world events, traumatic events, and significant life changes were top contributors to adolescents’ overall stress. Given that a large part of most adolescent’s lives focuses on academics, Smith describes academic demands such as tests, keeping up with peers, pleasing parents and applying to college as academic stress. While being in school, adolescents are often in multiple social situations and Smith describes social stress as consciously or unconsciously attempting to balance their self-exploration, romantic relationships and peer pressure. With the evidence that the stressors in adolescence are not going away, developing programs or imparting knowledge around coping and managing stress works in a proactive way to head off potential complications before they become larger issues needing more intense interventions.

## Stress Effects on Adolescents

Every adolescent experiences stress in some form and while they may have similar experiences, the effects of that stress can range in its manifestation from one individual to another. The levels of stress some working adults face pales in comparison to that of a high school adolescent. Because the brain is continuing to mature and develop over adolescence, the consequences of exposure to stressors may be different from or greater than in adulthood. Chronic exposure to stress hormones can have a negative impact on brain structures involved in cognition and mental health. Literature suggests that exposure to stressors in adolescence leads to relatively permanent changes in cognition. Some additional issues adolescence face due to increased stress include weight gain, lack of sleep, depression, anxiety, and academic decline.

Spear discusses the manifestation of certain behaviors due to stress faced during the transitional period of adolescence to adulthood. Along with the physical changes, there are behavioral changes that mark the adolescent years that can be attributed to the stress experienced in that period of life. Risk-taking is examined by Spear as a tool used by adolescents to not necessarily seek any positive outcomes from exploration, but instead as a means of coping with stress. The risk-taking behaviors include early exposure to drugs and alcohol, minor property destruction, and early sexual intercourse. Some of the risk-taking behaviors had long-term implications for the trajectory of an individual’s life.

Spear claimed that results from the Carnegie Foundation study on adolescence showed that when an adolescent is under stress, they show much poorer cognitive performance under circumstances involving everyday stress and time-limited situations than in more ideal situations. Additionally, in the study adolescents displayed a higher frequency of depressed mood and sleep disruptions due in part to the increase in overall number of stressful events in the transitional period. Sleep issues can, in turn, lead to a decline in adolescent behavior and academic performance potentially starting a snowball effect of self-doubt and detachment. The cyclical nature of stress and effects of stress were discussed in the Spear’s article in the way that negative events not only predict later problems, but problem behaviors also predict later increases in the number of perceived negative events.

In an article by Compas et al., the effects that stress has on adolescents can be shown through their way of coping. These actions may be taken without thinking of the consequences, positive or negative, that could follow. The way in which adolescents cope can depend on a myriad of factors such as the context of the stressful situation, their developmental level, and any previously learned styles of responding to stress. Compas et al. simplified coping into two camps, engagement coping and disengagement coping. The academic stress reduction curriculum is focused on strengthening engagement coping. They stated that “engagement coping includes responses that are geared either toward the source of stress or toward one's emotions or thoughts (e.g., problem solving or seeking social support); disengagement coping refers to responses that are oriented away from the stressor or one's emotions or thoughts (e.g., withdrawal or denial). The disengagement coping style can result in catastrophizing, distraction, distancing, avoidance, self-criticism, blaming others, suppression, social withdrawal, denial, or alcohol/drug use leading to long-term negative effects on one’s mental health and capacity.

Galvàn and Rahdar give an overview of the relationship between decision-making and stress, explaining that stressors alter one’s decision making abilities. Their claim is that under stress, one may make a decision quickly, arbitrarily, and with little considerations of all possible outcomes. The article references an experiment conducted by Giora Keinan on 101 undergraduate students (42 males, 59 females) at the University of Haifa with a mean age of the sample being 25. This study was conducted before any study had been conducted on younger adolescents and was used to encourage the study of younger subjects years later. Keinan randomly divided the subjects into two groups; one group was placed under “stress” conditions, created by the possibility of electric shock based on performance, while the other group was placed under “no-stress” conditions. Each group of subjects were asked to solve decision-making problems. The findings were indicative of stress leading to poor decision-making for those that received shocks because participants did not consider all possible outcomes before making a choice. While exploratory behavior during adolescence is not uncommon and often expected or encouraged, Galvàn and Rahdar suggest that adolescents with higher levels of stress are more susceptible to risk-taking behaviors such as drug, alcohol and cigarette use, sexual promiscuity, and reckless driving due to the impairment on their decision-making.

Rahdar and Galvàn team up again to discuss the cognitive and neurobiological effects of daily stress in adolescents. This article centers on the known research showing that daily stressors may have more of a lasting effect on an individual’s cognitive abilities in comparison to singular traumatic events regardless of age. For example, Galvàn and McGlennen conducted a study that contributed to the facilitation of our understanding of the effects of daily stress, specifically in adolescents, due to the developmental fragility of that period. The participants were 18 adolescents aged 14-17 and 16 emerging adults aged 18-21. To avoid recall bias and having to recreate a stressful environment, researchers monitored participants through texting Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). An EMA involves repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, and in subjects' natural environments as explained by Shiffman, Stone and Hufford. Participants communicated through their personal cellular devices three times a day for two weeks when texted by the study to capture their stress levels at each contact. Additionally, each participant was asked to make two lab visits to complete cognitive control tasks during both a high stress and low stress state. Results showed worse performance in adolescents under the high-stress state with these adolescents having a slower response time. Overall there were no other significant differences in the cognition that was tested, leading to the previous claims of similar stress effects on decision making in adolescents as adults. Galvàn and McGlennen’s preliminary study provided the initial experimental support for the hypothesis that stress influences risky decision-making in adolescents in a similar manner as it does in adults. Rahdar and Galvàn concluded that the research pointed to the stress in adolescents as having negative consequences on their cognitive and neurobiological capabilities. # Academic Stress in Adolescents

Academic stress is the most reported source of stress for adolescents. Academic stress is mental distress with respect to some anticipated frustration associated with academic failure. Stressful academic situations can compromise a student’s performance. Cognitive functioning is affected, specifically the short-term memory system that is involved in controlling, regulating, and actively maintaining a small amount of information that is currently relevant to the task at hand; this is known as the working memory. Working memory is crucial to learning and retaining information in academic settings. In stressful academic situations working memory is disrupted and unable to do its job efficiently. Beilock and DeCaro conducted an experiment with 92 undergraduate students of midwestern United States universities. The participants were assigned to a group of low or high pressure. Each of the participants were then asked to complete a series of mathematic problems without the use of assistance (i.e., calculator, paper and pencil). The results showed that those in a high-pressure group was more likely to have lower performance on the tasks that required more use of working memory. Whether an adolescent has an already established working memory that is low or high does not matter in terms of how academic stress can affect their ability to perform.

Over the years academic stress has been identified as a significant contributor to several mental health problems in adolescents. Students stressed by heavy workload, high academic expectation and dissatisfaction with their grades are susceptible to severe psychological symptoms, such as depressed mood, anxious feelings and even suicidal thoughts and acts when coping resources are exhausted. Sun, Dunne, and Hou state that in past studies academic stress has been the top source of stress. A study in the United States found that 42% of adolescents stress about school-related topics daily. Sun,

Dunne, and Hou’s article points out that studies have supported the claims that girls

experience more academic stress than boys, but this is not to disregard the amount of

academic stress boys face in adolescence. High school aged adolescents face more

academic stress due to the nature of their coursework along with their nearing transition

into college, a career and adulthood. The catch 22 is that high achievement academically

is important to set one’s self up for the future yet the rise in common mental disorders,

such as alcohol and substance abuse, eating disorders, anxiety and psychoses calls into

question the outlets in which adolescents have to effectively deal with the pressures that

come along with academic stress.

Jayanthi, Thirunavukarasu and Rajkumar set out to study the relationship

between academic stress and depression among adolescents. They conducted a cross-

sectional study at higher secondary schools in Tamil Nadu, India. The participants

included 1120 adolescents screened by the MINI-kid tool, an assessment of the 30 most

common and clinically relevant disorders or disorder subtypes in pediatrics mental

health. The researchers used the Modified Educational Stress Scale for Adolescents.

The results showed that adolescents who suffered with academic stress were at 2.4 times

higher risk of depression than adolescents without academic stress. The researchers

concluded that adolescents with severe academic stress need to be identified early so as to

intervene and mitigate the effects that lead to depression.

Multiple other studies support the findings that academic stress is detrimental to

the mental health and development of adolescents, yet the negative effects can be

moderated through proper resources and coping mechanisms. Research continues to show that adolescents are suffering most of their stress from the academic realm of their lives

whether that be for the expectations they put on themselves, expectations put on them by others, or the reality that to gain success in life some type of education is necessary. The stress that comes with academics regarding high stakes tests (SAT, ACT, AP Exams, etc.), overbooked schedules, parent pressure and potential college admittance has created a rise in reported cheating, sleepless nights, depression, drug use, and self-mutilation. Constant states of academic stress (i.e., chronic academic stress) are shown to have negative implications on an adolescent’s physical, emotional, and behavioral health often leading to coping strategies of detachment and drug or alcohol experimentation. With no permanent solution to alleviating academic stress on the horizon, coping strategies, and need for positive reinforcement of coping strategies so not to negatively affect the trajectory of an adolescent’s life, are encouraged. Development of maladaptive coping strategies such as cheating, drug use, and self-mutilation specific concerns for adolescents if more interventions for the sources of stress are not addressed to alleviate its effect.

Assessment of the Literature

The recurring themes in the research supported the claims from BridgeUP scholars that adolescents are indeed susceptible to stress. Further, the research showed several sources of stress for adolescents with academic stress being at the top of every list. The effects of stress on an adolescent's health as shown in the literature were cause for BeWell to continue to push for the development of their academic stress reduction curriculum. The effects of stress on adolescents, as shown in the literature, have potentially grave consequences. Stress can alter an adolescent’s mind state, not allowing them to think clearly. In their state of stress adolescents are more likely to make more risky decisions that may have lasting effects on their livelihood.

The body of literature that focuses on stress and its effects on adolescents has grown over the years. The recent literature, across the board, identifies academic stress (i.e., school-related stress) as a top contributor to the stress of adolescents. There are theories and experiments conducted in the literature to collect data on the effects of stress on an adolescent’s mind and body but there is less research that takes it a step further to investigate how to combat and lessen the effects of stress in adolescents. The literature is missing much needed data supporting solutions to the management of academic stress.

Future research should include looking at programs aimed to lower academic stress, isolate and study the elements of those programs, and create experiments testing them in attempt to establish a tried and true way to reduce academic stress. The literature shows that stress is indeed a part of life and has its benefits but there is less about reduction or channeling of stress to improve academic performance outside of mindfulness practices, exercise or eating well. Once efforts in the public health realm are put into finding alternative ways to reduce stress in adolescents of all backgrounds, programs can be created and evaluated.

Social-Emotional Learning

Social and emotional learning (SEL) is the process through which children and adults acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions. The SEL framework was designed to be used in communities and schools. BeWell and BridgeUP both base their developed curriculum in SEL. SEL has proven to improve the rates of high school graduation, college/career readiness, healthy relationships, mental health, criminal behavior, and engage citizenship. Various studies that have been conducted over the last few decades are continuing to echo the sentiment that SEL leads to a healthier community overall. The 5 competencies of SEL are:

- Self-awareness
- Goal setting, knowing strengths and weaknesses, recognizing emotions

- Self-management
- Emotional and behavioral regulation, stress management, self-motivation, working towards goals

- Social Awareness
- The ability to take the perspective of others

- Relationship Skills
- Obtain the tools to cultivate and sustain healthy, positive relationships with others

- Responsible decision-making skills
- The ability to make constructive and responsible choices # HOMES AND COMMUNITIES

#### CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION

The outcomes from using SEL methods continue to support the idea that the framework is perfect for the curriculum creation at BeWell. Durlack, Weissberg, Dyymnicki, Taylor, and Schellinger conducted a Meta‐Analysis of School‐Based Universal Interventions reporting the four major benefits found from implementing an SEL framework are as follows:

- **Academic Success**
- An 11 percent rise was found in students’ academic achievement scores when using SEL framework.

- **Fewer behavioral problems**
- Students engaged in SEL based curriculum were shown to have 10 % less psychological, behavioral or substance abuse problems by the age of 25.

- **Less emotional distress**
- Students that experienced the SEL based curriculum reported fewer instances of depression, anxiety, stress, and social withdrawal. ### Positive social behavior

- Peers, staff, parents and independent observers reported that students who were exposed to an SEL based curriculum exhibited better attitudes with others and were able to get along better with others.

The academic stress reduction curriculum is based in the SEL framework. Each lesson identifies the specific competencies touched upon through the application of the skill taught. Many of the articles citing SEL were in school settings; therefore, this curriculum is evidence informed and not evidence based due to it taking place in an afterschool program.

### Academic Stress Reduction Curriculum

Prior to the creation of the academic stress reduction curriculum, there were small lessons called BeWell Breaks. These BeWell Breaks were aimed at educating BridgeUP scholars on topics from physical health, nutrition, sexual health and mental health domains. BeWell Breaks were short overviews of how each domain is affected in adolescence with tips on how to improve one’s overall health through that domain. These BeWell Breaks were born out of the goal of injecting a health and wellness element into the BridgeUP scholar’s routines. The literature review of stress and its specific role in adolescent’s lives came out of feedback from BridgeUP scholars about stress in their lives around school-related issues including applying for college, annual examinations, and everyday school work piling up. From there, BeWell staff identified academic stress as something to address with the population with whom they work. Building from the outline of BeWell Breaks, BeWell began to develop a curriculum around organizational skills and other stress reduction tools to begin in October 2018. Research was conducted on lesson planning, engaging adolescents and academic stress to create a proposal of the academic stress reduction curriculum to present to BridgeUP administrators. Each lesson in the academic stress reduction curriculum is taught by a BeWell Health Coach and has a run time of 15 minutes. Health Coaches are assigned a specific library site to work with during an academic year on a weekly basis in order to build rapport and assist in scholars’ academic achievement. Through their regular presence at the sites, they form relationships with the staff so as to collaborate efficiently around the needs of their scholars. The concept behind the academic stress reduction curriculum is to teach a skill to the scholars, give them time to try the skill on their own and record the use of the skill after the initial lesson. A lesson will be taught in one week and the following week the Health Coach will spend time debriefing the utilization of the tool since the previous week. At the end of every lesson BeWell will also provide what they call “Calming Cues,” a step-by-step tutorial of a series of activities that scholars can use to reduce stress levels when faced with an acute increase in anxiety or stress such as slow diaphragmatic breathing, body scan meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation. After each skill is introduced, BridgeUP scholars will be provided with a notecard that will include a brief overview of the skill and a Likert scale ruler to measure how effective they found the skill. BridgeUP scholars will be encouraged to practice each skill on their own and return their completed Likert scale ruler to their Health Coach, Fellow or tutor. Scholars who regularly demonstrate skills learned and return their completed rulers are provided with incentives. A point system was designed for each academic tool. For example, if a BridgeUP scholar creates a studying music playlist they would receive a set amount of points but if they use that playlist regularly, they can receive additional points weekly. The points are tallied on a wall mounted tracker to encourage friendly competition at the site and act as a reminder of the tools. Reporting of academic tools used is on an honor system. The scholars with the most points at the end of each marking period receives a prize and is recognized on BeWell’s social media.

Limitations of the Academic Stress Reduction Curriculum

The curriculum created is in no way foolproof and there are limitations to the creation, implementation and evaluation of it. During the research process there were not many curricula that were found by the author that BeWell could exactly model. This curriculum is a living curriculum and will continue to change as needed in the future. Additionally, the scholars are not mandated to be present during the academic stress reduction lessons. This can lead to the curriculum being ineffective in its intended purpose. BeWell has added resources to each lesson plan that scholars can review outside of the lessons but if the scholar is not present for the lesson it would be difficult to say that the curriculum contributes to their reduction in stress. Finally, the evaluation that BeWell plans to conduct is not one that involved pre and posttests but that of self-assessments and opinion-based questionnaires. BeWell currently solicits feedback from the scholars on their needs and if those needs are being met. The evaluation will not directly look at the relationship between the reduction of stress a scholar reports and their academic performance. Looking at this relationship in the future may help to legitimize

the curriculum and its potential effectiveness. With these limitations recognized, BeWell

may benefit from conducting qualitative focus groups throughout the academic year so as

to make changes to the curriculum as seen fit with a final evaluation of the curriculum at

the end of the year. # Lesson Plan Example

The following is an example of a lesson plan created to inform Health Coaches, Fellows and tutors of the outline to follow when teaching. Each Health Coach is free to add their own flare to the lesson plans in accordance to how their site’s scholars learn best. Before each lesson is taught BeWell and BridgeUP staff meet to inform everyone about the upcoming lesson and garner any suggestions on modification if they can stay within the 15-minute allotment. The meetings prior to the lesson serve to create better cohesion between BeWell and BridgeUP staff to create a flow of teaching and agreed reinforcement of skills within the sites. Since the lessons are limited to their 15-minute timeframe each lesson plan used by Health Coaches and Fellows include additional resources for staff and scholars to review on their own time.

**SEL Competencies:** Self-Management (organizational skills, stress management)
**Objective:** To learn to use a physical Planner in order to organize tasks in a place of reference to free up learning capacity and stay organized.
**SWBAT:**
1. Identify how they currently manage tasks they need to do
2. Have two weeks in their Planner filled out with their due dates, assignments, obligations and activities
3. Reference, at a glance, the assignments they have due
**Duration:** 15 Minutes
**Materials needed:** BridgeUP or School Planners, oak tag, markers
**Preparation:**
- Fellows - Prior to the lesson, remind scholars to bring their Planners to BridgeUP - even if they have never used it.
- Health Coach - A short PowerPoint on the use of a planner. Prep two planners that show a good and bad way to utilize it

**Instructions:** Today we are going to discuss using your Planner. It is easy to get so caught up in your daily life, that the bigger picture can often fall from sight. A planner is a great way to have a reminder of future important dates keeping in view the larger goals.

**Baseline Activity:** Word Tennis - divide the class into two groups and ask them to take turns saying words that come to mind when they think of Planners. No words can be repeated. The idea is that this a game of word tennis and so should be scored as such. Have each teams’ answers be displayed on an oak tag (A team will get a point if the other team doesn’t have a word in a specified amount of time or repeats a word. First team to 3 points wins. This way we can try to exhaust all their feelings about planners. The HC could enlist the fellow or a tutor to record the words used to tally the positive and negative feelings.) | Time (mins) | Learning principle                                                                 | Instructor will                                                                 | Students will                                                                 | Extension and post-session application                                                                 |

No words can be repeated. | - Describe the use of a planner for the reason of having the schedule for your life (school, social activities, work, etc.) all in one place. Explain the benefit of planning ahead | - Provide examples of people they know who use planners and what they use them for. Then analyze if they feel those people are organized or not. |
| 2           | Instructor modeling – demonstrating the application of the content                 | - Provide a personal anecdote of how having a Planner helps to be more efficient | - Provide feedback, ask questions                                              | Scholar Video Use of Planner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_me6xEUovg4                             |

- Place assignment by class name the day it is assigned

- Place class assignment on day that its due

- Add activity they have in the evening, so they know if they have time to study

- Instruct the scholars to list their activities for the next week in the Planners as well as their recurring monthly events in the month section

- Complete the next 2 weeks in their planners with their due date and future plans

- Go around and engage with scholars as they fill in their planner for the next 2 weeks ## Peer Modeling
- Ask scholars who have experience with planners to help those at their table (if applicable) OR to show everyone their planner
- Help peers at their table with their planner OR show everyone their Planner

## Reflection and close out – anticipating next steps and connecting to next week’s topic(s)
- Homework: continue to fill out their Planner with important dates such as birthdays, SATs, tests, group projects, vacations, sports practice etc.
- Inform students of the following week’s topic
- Inform them of the points earned towards semester ending prize if they use their Planners!

## Reinforcement
Add Planner to the academic organization tracker

## Debrief: (10 minutes)
The goal is to determine how successful the scholars were in using the tool in the last week. In small groups, discuss scholars’ experience with use of the academic tool. Discuss what they like or disliked as well as how and where they found the use of the tool most useful to gain an understanding of the type of learner they are so to expand the skills taught in future lessons. Additionally, questions around the tools effectiveness in reducing the scholars stress are to be addressed. This can also be used as a time to gauge their understanding of the tool or access to the time to use it and brainstorm ways they can bypass these barriers. These questions serve as a starter to the conversation and general guide. Allow the scholars to use some peer teaching if one or more has more experience with the tool than the others.

1. Review take home assignment
2. How did you use this tool in the last week? a. Show any physical evidence of the tool being used
3. Where were you when you used the tool?
a. Why did you feel comfortable using it there?
4. Why do you think you didn’t use the tool at (insert a location the scholar didn’t mention i.e. in the home, school, friend’s home)?
a. Try to uncover their barriers to see if there is a way you can problem solve with them
5. What were some things you found easy?
6. What were some things you found difficult?
7. Is this something you see yourself continuing?
8. Was there anything that we didn’t discuss that you did to make things easier or enhance your experience with the tool?
9. If you chose not to use the tool, what stopped you? Any barriers?
10. Use peer modeling to pair off those students who may need more coaching with those that are more proficient.

Additional Lesson Plans for the Fall semester and the full schedule of implementation can be found in Appendix A and Appendix B. # Sample Tracking Form

## Points system

For every documented use of a study skill, the following points will be awarded:
- Planner check by HC/Fellow - 2 points per week
- Creation of study playlist - 10 points once approved
- Guidelines for appropriate playlist will be provided to fellows and health coaches and are based on tasks to be completed (ex: minimal lyrics for playlists used when writing essays or reading)
- Pomodoro technique - 2 points for each day when technique is used in den
- Effective study guide - 5 points for each created and approved
- Calming cues - 1 point per use

Scholars who have the most points at the end of each marking period will receive a small prize. Student Feedback

This year, 2018, is the first year of implementation of the academic stress reduction curriculum by BeWell. Likert scale rulers will be used for every lesson to measure through self-rating how effective in reducing their stress the scholars found the skill and how likely they would be to continue to use the tool. The point system is not only to encourage use of the tools taught but to track the utilization for evaluation purposes. The literature regarding academic stress identified the need for time management and organization; therefore, this curriculum focused on teaching and encouraging the use of tools that would help the BridgeUP scholars plan according to the tasks that they are needing to complete in regard to their academic career and path. Additionally, every summer BeWell conducts an end of year evaluation asking for feedback from BridgeUP staff and scholars on their performance throughout the previous year. The 2019 evaluation will include questions about using the tools and skills introduced, content, implementation and maintenance of the academic stress reduction curriculum so to make any improvements for upcoming years. There is no plan to evaluate the impact this curriculum has on the scholar’s academic performance but that may be a point of evaluation in the future.

Conclusion

Stress is a part of life and chronic stress can have negative effects on individuals, especially during the adolescence, when stress has a high potential to produce long-term adverse outcomes. accepted into college can be overwhelming and create stress. BeWell’s academic stress

reduction curriculum aims to arm BridgeUP scholars with the tools needed to lay each

individual brick throughout their high school career. BeWell strives to inform BridgeUP

scholars that all their peers are facing a similar task, but it is hoped that through

consistently and intentionally implementing the skills taught in the academic stress

reduction curriculum scholars will make the task of building a wall (i.e., graduating high

school) into a manageable and less stressful process. References

SEL Competencies: Responsible Decision Making (analyzing situations, evaluating), Self-Management (stress management, goal-setting, organizational skills)

Objective: To Learn to create TO DO List in order to organize tasks in a place of reference to free up learning capacity and stay organized.

SWBAT:
1. Identify how they currently manage tasks they need to do
2. Identify a paper and an electronic version of a TO DO List
3. Create a daily TO DO List of their week’s tasks on paper
4. Identify a task that is High Priority and use highlighter or stick note to denote it
5. Access at least one electronic method and one physical method of TO DO List

Duration: 15 Minutes

Materials needed: Scholar Laptops, Laptop and projector, YouTube videos, post-it notes, highlighter, small journals/notepad, ME/NOT ME Handout

Preparation:
- Fellows - all scholars should have a laptop to use. Remind scholars to bring PLANNERS
- Health Coach - Bring all materials, distribute sticky notes/highlighter/note pad/ME/NOT ME Activity sheet. Have YouTube videos preloaded on a ppt slide to watch during teach new skill

Instructions: Today the topic of the day is to create TO DO LIST. On any given day we all have to complete 5 - 6 tasks ranging from brushing our teeth to finalizing a report that’s due. With so many tasks to do, it is not surprising when someone forgets to do something without a reminder.

Baseline Activity: ME/NOT ME

Purpose: Help scholars identify how they currently handle the list of tasks they need to complete in a day/week

Introduction: Today’s topic is google drive organization. We found that many of our scholars are spending a lot of their precious time trying to find folders and files in their google drives which leads to added stress and frustration. Today we are going to go over a few tips on how to properly organize your google drive through correct creation and labeling of folders and files.

| Time (mins) | Learning principle | Instructor will | Students will | Additional Resources |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Opening     | - Reference the lesson plan from 2 weeks ago and segue into explaining that today’s topic is organizing their Google Drive (SEE INTRODUCTION) | | | | - Lead a brief activity to find out what scholars’ perceptions are of their use of their google drive. Ask a series of questions to gauge their level of comfort using google drive. (Have them stand up if a question pertains to them, then sit)
- Stand when one of the categories resembles how they feel about how organized their google drive is

Baseline- explore what is already known about today’s topic

- Who doesn’t use google drive at all?
- Who feels their google drive could use some organizing?
- Who is very comfortable with how well their google drive is organized?

- We know that most schools use google drive to share homework, reports, assignments. Ask scholars to stand if their school does this.

Motivation – why is this content important?

- Explain the benefits of an organized google drive:
- less stress
- less wasted time
- easily send to teachers when labeled appropriately
- easier to find documents when in folders instead of randomly on drive Instructor modeling – demonstrating the application of the content

- Provide a personal anecdote on what happened when your drive was not organized (accidentally sent a poorly labeled document to a boss or professor) and how life improved once organized them.

- Lead Activity:
- Scholars will observe HC/Fellows demonstrating best practices for organizing google drive.
- Create folders: all homeless files need a folder. If want files to be placed in a certain order can apply a prefix number. Don’t be shy about how many folders you make (no trees are being used!) You can have as many subfolders as you need.

Teaching new skill
- For example, Math: Tests/HW/Quiz/Notes
- Can start organizing their drives by giving each class a folder with this school year Math 2018-2019
- If there are a lot of homeless files: open file trees to left and drag and drop your files into the folders or ctrl key to select multiple files at the same time 2. Name files carefully - Using a generic name might be the quickest solution for organization but will probably make it more difficult in the long term. Having a file named just “notes” for every class will get confusing, especially if you’re using google drive for sharing! Make sure your file names are “sharp” (focused, concise, relevant to content), rather than “fuzzy” (vague, unrelated to content).
Fuzzy: Lesson Plan
Sharp: Week 3 Lesson Plan/Google Drive 2018
Fuzzy: Meeting Agenda
Sharp: Curriculum Meeting Agenda 3/21/18
Adding date at the end lets you know when it was last updated so can keep track of files etc. that need to be reviewed
3. Color Your Folders: Right click on folder to change color for easy ID
Bonus organizational tool - match your notebook/binder color to your google drive folder color!
Guided practice – - All staff go around and assist scholars to start to organize their google drives. Start by making folders for their classes. Help see what each person should
- Scholars will open laptops explore their own google drive.
During this time, scholars while coach/peers accomplish in the few minutes during guided practice should begin to examine how support them and then tell them what they should continue to do by their drive is organized, start to reorganize as discussed and have a plan to finish organizing before the debrief next week.

When working with the scholars, take note:
- If they have folders already: make sure they don't have any homeless files
- If they don't have any homeless files: make sure they have appropriate names for folders and files
- If they have appropriate names: make sure they have enough categories to make it easier to find
- If they have enough categories: then color code

- Inform students of the next topic (In 2 weeks we will discuss….)

Reflection and close out –
- Follow through: Continue to work on organizing their google drive with the pointers described in lesson. During debrief, they can discuss how to handle “shared with me” files, using emoji’s to make for easy to find files and use of google keep. Have everyone review article on website. Remind scholars of the rating ruler for reward - our center/tips/drive/ feedback tool to rate the activity and calming cue - #!/ which will earn them an extra point on the google drive chart. SEL Competencies: Self-management (stress management, organizational skills, goal-setting, impulse control), Self-awareness (identifying emotions, self-efficacy)

Objective: Discuss how to use Pomodoro Technique
SWBAT: 1. Understand the usefulness of Pomodoro Technique

- Describe the use of the Pomodoro technique as a way to make the best use of your time when completing tasks or studying. Anecdote: Kendra sat down at the desk in her room ready to start her science homework and study for her math exam Friday. She goes to YouTube to find a song and ends up on her favorite influencers page. After two videos she gets settled on a song. At this point Bianca is blowing up her inbox and she spends the next 10 minutes texting her back. Kendra can’t concentrate on her homework so while texting she decided to watch the snaps on her feed. An hour flies by and no studying or homework has been done, and now her Mom is calling her to help get dinner ready.

1.5
Instructor modeling – demonstrating
- Anecdote: Kendra decided ahead of time to block off time after school and makes her friend aware that she will not be the application available during that time period. She of the content makes use of a timer to be focused on a task for a given time and build in her breaks to check things that are important to her.

SHOW:
Natalie YouTube video: (Stop at 1:36 mark)

EXPLAIN:
- Listen and take notes if needed Scholars YouTube:
1. The idea is to structure your work so that you tackle one task at a time. The idea is to focus intensely on that one task for 25 minutes, then take a short break.
2. The technique is centered around 25 minute chunks of time because that has been found to be the length of time people can stay focused on an activity. 3. Clear your work space except for what you will be working on during the pomodoro cycle
4. Since our minds still may have distracting thoughts - have a blank paper or a sticky note next to you so that when something pops up you can write it down and forget about it at that moment
5. put your phone on “Do Not Disturb,” or turn sound off so you don't get any alerts
6. get your music lined up in advance
7. During the 5-minute break you can check your Snap streaks/get a snack/stretch/look at what you wrote down etc.
OR
Show this: good explanation of what it is and how to set up your work environment especially like in a BridgeUP setting - Instruct the scholars to open their schedules, planner or electronic calendar, to block off time in the next week to complete school work outside of BridgeUP using the Pomodoro technique
- what assignments they have that could be appropriate for pomodoro technique
- what they will use to write down distracting thoughts i.e.: sticky note/pc of paper
- what type of timer they will use. It should not be one that they see clicking the seconds/minutes down (as that is a distraction!)

### Distraction Blockers
- [Zapier Blog: Stay Focused - Avoid Distractions](https://zapier.com/blog/stay-focused-avoid-distractions/)

### Guided practice – students apply content while coach/peers support them
- Be able to acknowledge the importance of the Pomodoro technique

### Reflection and close out – anticipating next steps and connecting to next week’s topic(s)
- Follow through: Task scholars to use the Pomodoro technique at least one full cycle (2 25 min sessions with 5 minute break after each) before the debrief session next week. **** Would be ideal to lead into an actual pomodoro session in the den immediately following the lesson as it should be a homework day.

During debrief session can show scholars different timers they can use: SEL Competencies: Self-management (stress management, self-discipline, self-motivation, organizational skills)
Objective: Discuss the benefits of using a Study Guide to get ready for a test or quiz
SWBAT: 1. Begin a Study Guide for a subject of the choice.
Duration: 15 Minutes
Materials needed: Laptop, projector
Preparation: Fellows - Ask the scholars to send a question to the HC about Study Guides before the session and bring any study material for a subject of their choice
Health Coach - Follow up with their scholars to make sure they send in their questions about Study Guides and create a FAQ sheet
Instructions: When studying there are many details that you can become distracted by, so it is imperative to be able to drill down the facts that are most important for you to know. A Study Guide is a way to simultaneously review the information taught in class and hone in on the specific things you need to know to pass an exam
Baseline Activity: Split the room into two groups. HC/Fellow will explain rules of study guide race - students will be given components of a study guide and components of an essay outline. Students must put the components in a logical order. They have 1 minute to complete the task, and the group that is closest is the winner. As a debrief, show of hands: Was that more or less difficult for you expected?

| 0.5         | Discuss Study Guides as the topic of the day (See Instruction Above) | | | 60 | 2.5 - Split the room into two groups. Demonstrate current knowledge of HC/Fellow will explain rules of study guide race - students will be given components of a study guide and explore what is already known about today’s topic, etc. - Students must put the components in a logical order. They have 1 minute to complete the task, and the group that is closest is the winner. - As a debrief, show of hands: Was that more or less difficult than you expected?
0.5 - Describe the use of a study guide to organize a large amount of material to retain. Anecdote: Marquees has a final exam before the winter break and the exam is covering material from the whole semester. He was reading his textbooks repeatedly and got lost in the minor details.
1 Instructor modeling – Anecdote: Marquees spoke with his teacher to get direction on how to tackle studying and decided to make a study guide detailing the main points of what was taught throughout the semester. The creation and review of the study guide helped him pass his exam with a 90.

## Review steps to making a proper study guide

- First, determine purpose. Ex: is this studying for a DBQ or other essay exam, or are you studying content for the regents or other standardized test?
- if you have the prompt for an essay DBQ, should be at top of page
- Gather the sources you need: notes, textbook, handouts, etc.
- Organize appropriately
- timelines vs. themes vs. comparison charts
- (create brief handout for lesson)
- Keep it simple, consistent, and concise - Encourage the scholars to take out the materials from school that they will build their study guide from
- Guide the scholars in the beginning construction of a study guide for the subject of their choice

For Scholars:
- Engage in the beginning stages of constructing a study guide for the subject of their choice
- Identify appropriate type of study guide, resources needed, and organizational choice

Guided practice – students apply content while coach/peers support them

Peer Modeling -
- Ask scholars to identify what exam/class they are studying for. If there are multiple scholars preparing for the same class/exam, take note in preparation of following week
- Determine what peers are working on similar classes/guides
- During following week, you will work with others in same class/exam group to practice peer modeling Reflection and      - Follow through: Create and use a
close out –         study guide for a subject or upcoming
anticipating next   test, if applicable. Compare study
steps and           guides with other students in similar
connecting to next  classes later in the week.
