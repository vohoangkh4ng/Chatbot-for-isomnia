Previous embodiment findings indicate a relationship between physical posture and mood states, suggesting upright postures induce positive mood states. Findings also showed a relationship between moods and cognitive performance. While positive mood states were found to be related to increased processing speed, negative mood states were associated with higher processing accuracy in cognitive task performance. This implies that posture may affect the aforementioned sub-aspects of cognitive performance via mood states. Additionally, most studies on posture effects rely on explicit posture manipulation. With that in mind, our research explores the effects of implicitly manipulated postures on processing speed and accuracy and whether these effects are mediated by general mood. The results revealed that subjects in our sample (N = 82, M = 23.09 years) who adopted an upright posture showed a more positive general mood (d = 0.50) and higher processing speed (d = 0.42) compared to those in stooped postures. Surprisingly, no differences in processing accuracy were found. There was no evidence of the proposed mediation in our data.

## 1. Introduction

In the past decades, the approach of embodied cognition has emerged, assigning the body a pivotal role as a major factor in cognitive processes. Contrary to non-embodied computational approaches in cognitive science, the assumption is that bodily cues and cognitive processes are deeply rooted in each other. Thus, the body is much more than an influencing factor; it is regarded as an essential element in the formation of cognition. Indeed, its significance is already supported by strong scientific evidence attesting to the value of the body and its action to cognitive processes and affective states. While a noticeable part of these empirical studies did recently examine the effects of posture on feelings and attitudes, comparatively fewer studies have investigated the effects of posture on cognitive task performance. Additionally, most studies on posture effects used explicit posture manipulation. Further, the mechanisms underlying a possible association between posture and cognitive performance remain unclear. Hence, the first goal of this study was to confirm the relatively established effects of postural positions on mood, using an implicit manipulation. Second, we wanted to further investigate the rather uncertain effects of posture on cognitive task performance; and third, we wanted to examine whether effects on task performance are mediated by mood states.

## 1.1. Relation of posture and mood

Various findings suggest a reciprocal relationship between mood and posture. For example, it was found that students adopted a comparatively more stooped posture after receiving negative feedback compared to positive feedback. Findings regarding mood effects on posture are further supported by research indicating that affective states are communicated via posturing. Subjects evaluating drawings of varied head and spine postures rated drawings of erect postures more positively than drawings of slumped postures. Moreover, slumped postures are associated with negative mood states in clinical contexts. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, in fact, a stooped posture is a physical criterion in the diagnosis of patients experiencing a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, there is a growing body of research suggesting that physical cues may precede mood-related experiences. Similar findings were also presented in a more recent study by Nair et al., in which participants in the slumped condition reported feeling more nervous and stressed, compared to those sitting in an upright position. In line with these observations, it was also discovered that accessing positive thoughts appears to be easier in upright, rather than in stooped postures. Reminiscent of William James' influential work, the latter suggests that the experience of feelings may be rooted in physical actions, and not vice versa.

The term body feedback is often associated with these experiences: it describes feedback of the entire body, during which information is transferred from the body to the brain and thus, to the cognitive and psychological processing system. The majority of the existing literature on body feedback focuses on facial feedback processes, also referred to as the facial feedback hypothesis. For instance, limited flexibility of facial expression, e.g., by the use of botulinum toxin, resulted in limitations of experienced sensitivity.

In consideration of feedback processes that emanate from the face and from the whole body, findings indicate that postures connect to feelings and attitudes. A study by Stepper and Strack revealed that, compared to subjects in a slouched body condition, participants who were seated in an upright position reported feeling significantly more pride after positive feedback on performance. Additionally, a recent study linked upright postures with experiences of higher self-esteem, increased arousal, a more positive mood, less fear and fewer negative words.

In a 2010 study, Carney, Cuddy, and Yap compared expansive with contractive postures and found the former to be related to an increase in testosterone, decrease in cortisol, increase in subjective feelings of power, as well as higher risk-taking behavior. However, in a subsequent replication attempt, only the effects of subjective feelings of power were replicated but no effects in neuroendocrine levels or behavior could be found. Carney et al. followed with a narrative review, comparing 33 studies on expansive vs. contractive postures. In their review, they outlined that expansive postures increase subjective feelings of power, whereas contractive postures might manifest in rather negative distortions, such as lower levels of confidence, associated with feelings of failure and depressive thoughts. However, p-curve analyses have raised doubts about the empirical evidence of power-posing on which the 2015 review was based. Countering these concerns, Cuddy et al. submitted an updated collection of 55 studies on postural effects to p-curve analysis, providing evidence for both postural feedback effects on subjective feelings of power and on other emotional and affective states. Taken together, the studies outlined herein largely support the conclusion that while upright postures may be associated with more positive moods, stooped postures may be associated with more negative moods.

## Mood effects on cognitive performance

There are indications that even small changes in mood states affect cognitive processes, rendering mood essential toward a thorough understanding of cognition. Nonetheless, earlier work suggests that opposing predictions can be made about the effects of mood states on cognitive performance, relative to cognitive task type. For example, regarding creative thinking tasks, it has been found that a positive mood can have broadening effects on attention, leading to the exploration and processing of supposedly irrelevant information that can be used for solving a given task. Findings also suggest that positive mood states are associated with a faster and more heuristic approach to information processing than that of negative mood states. In a study by Park and Banaji, subjects in a positive mood state showed greater reliance on heuristics. Consistent with these findings, literature on response inhibition shows that subjects in positive emotional contexts have a shorter reaction time than subjects in negative emotional contexts.

Positive moods might only have beneficial effects on certain types of tasks, and at the same time, may result in increased distraction. This might lead to positive moods negatively influencing tasks that require clear focus, as is the case with most tasks on executive functions. Concerning negative moods, the literature proposes that negative mood states might have enhancing effects on analytical thinking and focused processing.

A possible explanation for mood effects suggests that affective states play an informative role. Indeed, it may be the case that positive moods are associated with a feeling of safety and negative moods reflect a potential threatening situation to the individual. Researchers also consider that these mechanisms might have an evolutionary background. For example, in a safe environment, the individual may experience a lack of pressure to initiate changes, allowing for more general and heuristic processing, and enabling the individual to consider a greater variety of actions. In contrast, experiencing the feeling of facing a threatening situation initiates analytical thought processes. Through analytical thought processes, possibilities for action can be narrowed and focus can be placed on the task at hand in order to solve a given problem as quickly as possible.

## Posture effects on cognitive performance and mediation via mood

Given the outlined findings of posture on mood and mood on cognitive performance, it seems reasonable to conclude that there should also be a relationship between cognitive performance and posture. In a study by Nair et al., scholars detected beneficial effects of upright versus stooped postures on mood and on psychomotor speed. Participants in upright sitting conditions performed faster in a reading task than participants in a stooped condition. In a study by Riskind and Gotay, all participants received false positive feedback for a task, one half sitting in an upright posture, the other in a stooped posture. Those in an upright posture showed more persistence in a subsequent, standard learned-helplessness task than those who received the feedback in a stooped posture. Yet, contrary to the study by Nair et al., no effects of posture on mood-related variables were identified in the 1982 study. Further, a later study attributes the effects of posture on subsequent task-persistence to underlying interaction effects of posture and feedback. These findings were later replicated in a study by Ahn et al., in which the participants performed a task on a movable desktop computer that manipulated their posture.

Although effects of posture on performance would be expected from a theoretical point of view, to our knowledge, there are few studies exploring such effects. Based on outlined research suggesting effects of posture on mood and mood on cognitive performance, along with research indicating possible effects of posture on performance, we predicted posture would influence cognitive performance, mediated by mood states. # Current study

The literature suggests that upright postures appear to induce positive mood states, whereas stooped postures are associated with negative mood states. These results, however, are not yet conclusively established and, with rare exceptions, mostly relate to studies that used an explicit manipulation of posture. To avoid explicit knowledge of the manipulation in our study and in order to get the participants to adopt a certain posture, we modified the height of desks and chairs prior to testing.

Furthermore, concerning effects of mood states on cognitive task performance, previous research supports the hypothesis of beneficial effects of positive mood on processing speed as well as facilitating effects of negative mood on processing accuracy.

Taken together, all of these findings of postural effects on mood states and of mood states on cognitive task performance led to our estimation that subjects in upright postures would show higher processing speed, whereas subjects in stooped postures would perform better on processing accuracy. In other words, we hypothesized that effects of posture on cognition are mediated by mood states.

# Method

# Sample

A well-powered study found effect sizes of posture on different mood variables at approximately d = 0.60. Assuming this effect size, specifying an alpha of 0.05, power of 0.80 and using a one-tailed test, we calculated that the required sample size should be 72. Because of a lack of studies investigating posture effects on cognitive tasks, it was not possible to determine reasonable effect size estimates from previous studies. Therefore, we assumed the same medium effect size of d = 0.60 for effects on mood, which is a bit lower than a meta-analytic estimate of the mean effect size of d = 0.65 in psychological research in general. When entering the room, the experimenter instructed the participants not to change anything in the conditions, as the prerequisites had to be identical for all assessments.

# Physical posture modification

The aim of the posture modification was to achieve as natural a manipulation as possible – one that would not draw the participant's attention to his or her own posture. Therefore, we manipulated participants' posture by changing the relation of height-adjustable desks and chairs prior to testing: For the group in the upright condition, the desks were adjusted relatively high and the chairs comparatively low (height desk: 85.5 cm; height chair: 50 cm). In the group assigned to a stooped sitting posture, the manipulation was carried out in reverse (height desk: 70 cm; height chair: 54 cm), causing the participants to sit in a bent position. The dimensions given represent the height of the chair without the lowering that results from the suspension when one person is sitting on the chair.

# Measures

# Processing speed and accuracy

Participants were asked to work on the d2-R Test of Attention, a revised German version of the d2 Test of Attention. The d2-R is a paper-and-pencil letter cancellation test that combines both the measurement of processing speed and accuracy in cognitive task performance. It consists of 14 rows, each of which has a total sequence of 57 characters (“d” or “p”). The letters are marked with dashes that can occur in pairs, individually, above and/or below the characters. The number of dashes for each character ranges from one to four. Participants are instructed to move from left to right and cancel out as many “d”'s, marked with a total of two dashes, regardless of whether these are both above or below, or one dash above and one dash below the letter “d”. Participants are allotted 20 s time for each row. After the 20 s, participants received an instruction from the test leader to proceed immediately with the processing of the next line. Subjects are instructed to perform as quickly, but also as accurately as possible.

Scoring for processing speed and accuracy was done according to test instructions. Therefore, processing speed was measured by the number of processed items, ignoring whether target symbols or distractors had been cancelled out. Accuracy was evaluated with a percentage value, which resulted from the number of errors divided by the number of items processed. Cronbach's Alpha was 0.96 for processing speed and 0.92 for processing accuracy. ## 3. Results

### 2.4.2. Mood state
Mood state was assessed with a short German-language version of the Multidimensional Mood State Questionnaire (Mehrdimensionaler Befindlichkeitsfragebogen [MDMQ]; Steyer et al., 1997). The measured dimensions of the MDMQ are composed of three four-item scales that evaluate degrees of: 1) overall well-being, 2) fatigue, and 3) tension. Participants rated the twelve items on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) scale. Analyses of the MDMQ in a representative German sample revealed high correlations between the three subscales and indicated that a general mood scale consisting of the sum of all 12 items is appropriate. This scale also proved to be more reliable than the subscales. Our results confirmed these findings: while there was a strong first principal component explaining 47% of the variance, the Cronbach's Alpha of the general mood scale was 0.89. We used this general mood scale for our analyses.

### 3.1. Preliminary analyses
All values for our main variables were in the expected range, and none were more than 3.5 SDs above or below the respective means of the variables, with the exception of one data point that was 3.99 SDs above the average error percentage (processing accuracy). We carefully monitored how this data point influenced our results and calculated Cook's distances to detect problematic influence of single data points on our findings. All of these values fell well below the suggested problematic threshold of 1. There were no missing values in our main variables of general mood, processing speed, and processing accuracy.

### 3.2. Manipulation check
Participants rated their experienced degree of erectness as higher in the upright condition (M = 2.22, SD = 1.13) than in the stooped condition (M = 1.59, SD = 0.86), t(64) = 2.57, p = .007, one-tailed, d = 0.63, 95 % CI [0.14, 1.13]. As per recent recommendations—supported by the American Statistical Association—we report one-sided p values for our one-sided hypotheses. All confidence intervals of the effect sizes in this manuscript are based on Smithson, using the syntax of Wuensch. The difference between the erect and stooped conditions was smaller than expected.

### 2.5. Mediation analyses
We hypothesized that general mood would mediate the effects of posture on the dependent variables processing speed and accuracy. To find evidence for mediation, the following four steps developed by Baron and Kenny were tested: Step 1: The independent variable is related to the dependent variable. Step 2: The independent variable is related to the mediator. Step 3: The mediator is related to the dependent variable while the independent variable is held constant. Step 4: The independent variable is not related to the dependent variable anymore when controlling for the mediator. In experiments, all of the first three steps should ideally be met to establish evidence for mediation; for complete mediation step 4 is also required. We also considered effect sizes since judgments concerning mediation should not be based on statistical significance alone.

### 3.3. General mood
As expected, participants judged their general mood as higher in the upright condition (M = 3.77, SD = 0.67) than in the stooped condition (M = 3.43, SD = 0.68), t(80) = 2.27, p = .013, one-tailed, d = 0.50, 95 % CI [0.06, 0.94].

### 3.4. Processing speed
In line with our expectations, participants processed more objects in the upright condition (M = 187.40, SD = 32.37) than in the stooped condition (M = 174.93, SD = 26.31), t(80) = 1.92, p = .030, one-tailed, d = 0.42, 95 % CI [0.02, 0.86].

### 3.5. Processing accuracy
Contrary to our expectations participants did not work less accurately in the upright condition (M = 10.25, SD = 9.60) than in the stooped condition (M = 10.14, SD = 7.42), t(80) = 0.06, p = .477, one-tailed, d = 0.01, 95 % CI [0.42, 0.45]. 3.6. Mediation analyses

Steps 1 and 2 of the aforementioned steps procedure of a mediation analysis according to Baron and Kenny were already tested with the previously reported, independent-sample t tests (concerning statistical significance, they are equivalent to a linear regression with the experimental condition as the only dichotomous predictor). On processing speed, steps 1 and 2 were confirmed as there were considerable effects of posture on the processing speed, the dependent variable, and on general mood, the assumed mediator. For testing steps 3 and 4, processing speed was regressed on the independent variable (posture) and the assumed mediator (general mood). Step 3 was not confirmed as general mood was not related to processing speed (β = 0.01, p = .929, two-tailed). As step 3 is a necessary condition for mediation, there was no evidence for mediation by general mood. Concerning processing accuracy, there was no effect of posture on processing accuracy, as reported earlier. Therefore, step 1 of the mediation analysis was not confirmed. Step 2 was confirmed as indicated by the effect of posture on general mood. Step 3 was not confirmed as general mood was not related to processing accuracy (β = 0.11, p = .346, two-tailed).

4. Discussion

The results confirmed effects of postures on mood states from previous studies, this time using naturally modified postures. Second, as hypothesized, subjects in upright postures also showed higher processing speed compared to subjects in stooped postures. Predicted effects of posture on processing accuracy, however, were clearly not revealed; additionally, we found no effect of general mood on processing accuracy in the mediation analysis. Hence, for processing accuracy, the hypothesized mediation could not be identified. Although effects of posture on general mood and processing speed were revealed, general mood was not associated with processing speed; there was not even an indication of minor tendency. Consequently, no evidence of mediation could be found in our results. Regarding processing accuracy, previous work suggested subjects in negative mood states are more focused on the task at hand. However, in our experiment, there was no indication of such effects. We suggest different possible explanations for these results. One reason might be, that previous work predicting beneficial effects of negative mood states based on their informative function have mostly argued to find enhanced analytical thinking and problem solving. Due to differences in analytical thinking and processing accuracy, it may therefore be conceivable that findings in terms of analytical thinking cannot simply be applied to processing accuracy, as measured in the d2-R. As we have found posture effects on processing speed, but no evidence for mediation by general mood, we consider other possible mediators to explain these results. For example, the influence of posture on attitudes and metacognitive thinking may in turn affect cognitive performance. In a study by Stepper and Strack, participants who were seated in an upright posture reported feeling significantly more pride after positive performance-related feedback than subjects in a slouched posture. Furthermore, a study by Briñol et al. found increased confidence in thought in participants in upright postures compared to those in stooped postures. The experience of power, already made popular in the embodiment field, is another possible mediator. Findings on power and cognitive processing support the effects of power on processing speed, with high power being related to more abstract information processing. Further, when comparing expansive and contractive postures, revealed an increase in the subjective feeling of power in individuals adapting expansive postures through changes in neuroendocrine profiles. Like previous findings on testosterone and cortisol levels in people high in power, Carney et al. identified an increase in testosterone and a decrease in cortisol in individuals in expansive versus contractive postures. Taken together, the subjective feeling of power, and its reinforcement through neuroendocrine changes, could instead of mood function as a mediator. The literature elaborates further on physiological changes associated with a change in posture. Subjects in upright postures specifically, are linked to higher arousal, increased pulse pressure, heart rate and temperature. Such influencing factors might also be examined for possible mediation. Another explanation for our results includes a rather unstable, general posture-performance relation. In other words, we cannot rule out the possibility that no effects of posture on cognitive performance exist in general. More studies would be required to investigate this further.

5. Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, our chosen measurement instrument might be rather unsuitable for measuring effects of mood on processing speed or processing accuracy compared to instruments of previous studies. In previous studies on the effects of mood on processing speed, measuring instruments were mostly focused on strictly automatic processing, whereas the d2-R measures not only processing speed but also processing accuracy. Therefore, it was not possible to determine the d2-R's sensitivity to the effects of mood from the existing literature. The pragmatic benefit of measuring two elements at the same time might have had a negative impact on the costs of measuring the two elements accurately. Second, that the manipulation check is based on subjective evaluations of the participants may be a further limitation of this study. Furthermore, although the manipulation was generally successful based on these ratings, it cannot be ruled out that one possible reason for the absence of mediation via mood might be that our experimental manipulation did not affect strong enough changes in mood to have an indirect effect on cognitive performance. Another possible limiting factor in the context of manipulation, might be that, to achieve as implicit a manipulation as possible, we decided to use only one setup for each condition. This way, the conditions were not adapted to the individual size of the participants, thus the manipulation did not equally fit every person. Third, while we may have been intent on a very natural manipulation, the upright posture may have been perceived as more comfortable. Most studies on posture effects did not provide information on posture duration, but in their 2015 review, Carney, Cuddy, and Yap considered possible interaction effects of the duration for which the participants remain in the manipulated posture. They indicated that adopting the posture for a longer period, may lead to increased effects. They also suggested that particularly uncomfortable posture manipulations might cause discomfort or lead to one getting used to the respective posture, thus moderating the effects measured. Compared to most studies in the 2015 review, participants in our study held postures for a significantly longer time. In line with the authors' hypothesis on rather uncomfortable postures, the latter may have contributed to the absence of the assumed beneficial effects of stooped postures on processing accuracy in our data.

6. Conclusion

The results of the present study add to the existing literature on embodied cognition by confirming effects of postures on mood states using an implicit posture manipulation. We also found an effect of posture on processing speed. Our findings may provide interesting implications for environments in which one consciously intends to influence mood states or cognitive performance, such as learning contexts or therapeutic interventions

Several issues remain unresolved. Since the predicted mediation through mood states could not be confirmed in our studies, a theoretical explanation for the effects of posture on aspects of cognitive performance has not been found. Alternative explanations should be investigated. Furthermore, any possible limitations such as the role of the duration of postural manipulation require further examination
