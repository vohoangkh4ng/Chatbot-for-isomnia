# Title: Nutrition knowledge and other determinants of food intake and lifestyle habits in children and young adolescents living in a rural area of Sicily, South Italy

## Summary: This study investigates the reliability of a nutrition questionnaire and explores the relationship between nutrition knowledge, food consumption, and lifestyle behaviors among children and young adolescents in a rural Sicilian community. Conducted as a cross-sectional survey with 445 students aged 4 to 16, the findings indicate that higher nutrition knowledge correlates with healthier food choices, such as increased intake of fruits and vegetables and reduced consumption of sweets and sugary drinks. Additionally, parental education and occupation significantly influence children's dietary habits and physical activity levels. The study concludes that enhancing nutrition knowledge in youth, alongside parental involvement, could lead to improved dietary practices and overall family nutrition.
