# Title: What Keeps Us Awake: the Neuropharmacology of Stimulants and Wakefulness-Promoting Medications

## Summary: This article reviews the neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying sleep regulation and the effects of various stimulants and wakefulness-promoting medications. It discusses the complex interplay between neurotransmitter systems that promote wakefulness and sleep, highlighting the roles of noradrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, adenosinergic, and histaminergic systems, as well as the hypocretin/orexin and dopamine systems. The review emphasizes the importance of understanding these mechanisms to develop effective treatments for excessive daytime sleepiness associated with sleep disorders, while also addressing the potential for abuse and side effects of these medications.
