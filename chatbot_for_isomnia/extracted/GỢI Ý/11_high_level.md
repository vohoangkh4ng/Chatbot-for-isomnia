# Title: Evaluation of a School-Based Intervention for Adolescent Sleep Problems

## Summary: This study investigates the effectiveness of a school-based intervention aimed at improving sleep knowledge and addressing sleep problems among adolescents. Conducted as a randomized controlled trial with 81 students, the intervention involved four 50-minute classes over four weeks. While the program successfully increased sleep knowledge, it did not significantly impact overall sleep variables compared to a control group. However, it did show promise in reducing discrepancies between school and weekend wake times for adolescents with delayed sleep timing. The findings suggest that school-based interventions could be a novel approach to tackle adolescent sleep issues, although future programs may need to enhance motivation for behavioral change.
