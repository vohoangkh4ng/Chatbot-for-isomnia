# Title: Uncovering Synergistic Mechanism of Chinese Herbal Medicine in the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome by Network Pharmacology

## Summary: This research article explores the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) combined with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Utilizing network pharmacology, the study identifies 94 active components from six TCM liver-regulating herbs and their corresponding therapeutic targets. The findings suggest that TCM may operate through multiple pathways, including the regulation of nitric oxide biosynthesis and various signaling pathways, highlighting its potential as a safer and more effective treatment option for patients suffering from these conditions.
