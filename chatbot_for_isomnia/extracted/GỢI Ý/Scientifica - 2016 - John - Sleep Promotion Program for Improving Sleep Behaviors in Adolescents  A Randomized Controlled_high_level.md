# Title: Sleep Promotion Program for Improving Sleep Behaviors in Adolescents: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study

## Summary: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a sleep promotion program designed for adolescents in Mangalore, India. Utilizing a randomized controlled trial design, the study involved 58 adolescents and assessed various sleep-related parameters through self-report questionnaires. Results indicated that the intervention significantly improved overall sleep quality, sleep onset latency, sleep duration, and reduced daytime sleepiness in the experimental group compared to the control group. However, no significant effects were noted on sleep hygiene. The findings suggest that the program may enhance sleep behaviors in healthy adolescents, although further research is needed to confirm these effects.
