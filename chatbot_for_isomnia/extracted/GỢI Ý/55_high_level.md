# Title: A cluster randomized controlled trial of a theory-based sleep hygiene intervention for adolescents

## Summary: This article presents a study that evaluates a theory-based intervention aimed at improving sleep hygiene among adolescents. Utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Health Action Process Approach, the intervention was tested in a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 2,841 high school students. The results indicated significant improvements in sleep hygiene and related health outcomes in the intervention group compared to the control group at both 1 and 6 months post-intervention. The findings suggest that theoretically grounded interventions can effectively address sleep hygiene issues in adolescents, highlighting the importance of such approaches in healthcare practices.
