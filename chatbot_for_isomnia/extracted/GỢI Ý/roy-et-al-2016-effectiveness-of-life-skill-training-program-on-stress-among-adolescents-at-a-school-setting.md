# Effectiveness of Life Skill Training Program on Stress among Adolescents at a School Setting

## Abstract

**Background:** Psychological stress during adolescence is a natural phenomenon. Issues related to academics, parents, peers, social life, and personal doubts have always created some queries in these young minds. But most of the times, they get neglected by care givers. So the psychological stress tends to go unchecked among school students. There is not much work done in the area of stress levels and interventions among Indian adolescents. So our primary objective was to test the effectiveness of life skill training program in reducing stress among adolescents.

**Methods:** Forty two adolescent boys participated in the study. Prevalence of stress was determined by administering a standardized stress questionnaire. The intervention program consisted of seven daily sessions of 50 minutes each conducted within school timings. Life skills, stress management modules from NIMHANS model were selected to address adolescent stressors. SPSS 15 was used for data entry and analysis. Pre, post and three month follow up assessments were conducted.

**Results:** 66% of the adolescents reported to be stressed. The mean stress scores among adolescents who underwent the intervention program reduced significantly from 133 to 116 after post one month and to 117 after post three month follow up (p<0.05). Conclusion: Results suggested that group based stress management programs if conducted regularly would be beneficial to reduce the stress levels. Positive feedback from students suggested that these activities were feasible and acceptable.

Introduction

Adolescence is a period of hormonal and psychological changes ranging from 10-19 years (WHO). It is considered as important years of forming oneself in life of every individual. Mental health status of mid adolescent boys during transition years is largely unexplored in Indian context. Everybody has different perception levels. Any sort of stress that promotes and facilitates a person to excel in any form of work is positive stress. Any other form which suppresses, inhibits the same is negative stress. The levels of stress depend on one’s cultural background, personality, life experiences and coping skills.

Some of the roadblocks in research in the area of adolescent stress and role of intervention include stringent school timings, lack of awareness about adolescent mental health, no trained professional to deal sensitive matters like peer pressure and mainly lack of consent of parents for mental health issues. Due to these factors problems which directly or indirectly affect adolescent mental health are difficult to deal with. Previous researchers have reported that adolescents experience more amount of stress during school years compared to other phases of life. When stressors or their determinants go unchecked among adolescents, it commonly leads to problems like depression, anxiety, emotional outbursts, high risk behaviours, school dropouts, running away from homes, suicidal ideations. In recent times, the rate of suicides has increased among middle aged adolescents (14-16 years); most common reasons being failure in examination, peer rejection, family tensions etc. It has been observed that after puberty, rate of suicide increases with age till it stabilizes in young adulthood. Adolescent males compete in suicide at rates approximately five times higher than rates for adolescent females. Minimal research has focused to report the prevalence of stress among high school students especially boys. Various techniques to address stress among adolescents have been used like mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), Dialectal behaviour therapy (DBT), Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Other techniques used in past decades for reducing stress among adolescents were individual counselling, yoga, meditation, psychotherapy and cognitive therapy techniques. But no study has yet reported the use of life skills to reduce stress among Indian adolescents. So in our present study the aim was to assess the prevalence of stressed students and test the effectiveness of life skills training in reducing stress among them. Also we wanted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention program for which a semi structured questionnaire was used. ## Materials and Methods

Institutional ethical approval was obtained before the study began. The purpose of this study was discussed with the school authorities and due consent was obtained. A private unaided school in Udupi district was selected. Boys studying in class 9th and 10th standard of the particular school constituted the study population. This study design was an Intervention (pre-post-follow up) study design. Each participant acted as his own control.

### Tools

**Manipal Stress Questionnaire (MSQ):** This questionnaire measures the stress level of the individuals. A five point likert scale is used where 1 suggests “Strongly Disagree” and 5 suggests “Strongly agree”. Each question has options to be selected by the participant’s choice of experience. There are reverse scorings also for a few questions in each section. The MSQ is a self-report version. It consists of 48 items assessing the stressors. They are categorized into various domains as follows: Cognitive, Behavioural, Emotional, Physical, Social, and Academic. The total score is 240 and the participant with a score of 130 or above is considered to be stressed.

**NIMHANS model:** It is a comprehensive model focusing on all developmental issues of adolescents. It uses experiential learning with peers using participatory methods enabling the adolescents with psychosocial skills. The Model is discussed in detail elsewhere. Life skills (LS) are abilities for adaptive and positive behaviour that enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands, challenges, and stress of every-day life. Childhood and adolescence are the developmental periods during which

one acquires these skills through various methods and people. The generic LS are

1. Critical thinking & Creative thinking
2. Decision making & Problem solving
3. Communication skills & Interpersonal relations
4. Coping with emotions & stress
5. Self-awareness & empathy

Methodology

After obtaining the assent and consent from the students and parents respectively,

it was decided that the life skill training would be imparted for 7 consecutive days with

each session lasting for about 45 - 60 minutes. The intervention model was validated by

four external experts for their comments on selecting the activities that addressed the

various stressors like academics, peer pressure, parental pressure, relaxation before

exams, time management etc. Based on their comments, those Life skills which would be

beneficial to develop positive coping with these various stressors identified were selected

and administered. The concept of developing this model of workshop intervention was to

deal with each stressor per day and ways to deal with it in detail. Techniques of

storytelling, role plays, brain storming games, power point presentation, breathing

exercises for relaxation were used. After each session a group discussion was in

incorporated to obtain feedback about For a week, these activities were taught and

discussed with the adolescents. A follow up after 1 and 3 months was assessed by the

same MSQ. The mean stress scores were obtained for the same. Data Analysis

SPSS version 15 was used for data analysis. Data collected are presented in the form of Proportion & Percentages. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to study the effects of the life skill training program. Pre, post and follow –up mean stress scores were obtained at baseline, post one month and post three month.

Results

A total of 42 boys participated in the study. The mean age (SD) of the participants was 14.38 (1.05) years. 66% of the participants had significant stress. During the course of the study, few roadblocks that we came across are also reported. Obtaining the consent for conducting the training for a week during school hours was tough. After school hours, it was practically impossible to keep students in school for an hour. Series of discussions with teachers, principal and guardians were done to explain the importance of such training. This was feasible but the activities had to be conducted within the specified time (45 – 60 minutes). So, activities which would address adolescent stressors within the specified time were selected. These constraints were communicated with the panel of experts during content validation of the intervention model. The school authorities encouraged such programs that benefitted adolescents; teachers reported that due to time constraints they could not deal with students on a personal level to know about their problems.

Regarding feasibility and acceptability; a semi structured questionnaire was used. Almost all the participants (90%) termed the session to be “very helpful”. They liked sessions which addressed their “academic concerns”. Role plays on “peer pressure” was liked by all (100%). 84% of them recommended such programs to be carried on

“regularly”. Breathing exercises and positive imagery was reported be “new and

interesting”. There were no dropouts during the entire study. The participants (90%)

cleared many queries regarding adolescent changes, personal issues and mainly exam

related queries. A demand of counselling sessions was made by them. They also gave

suggestions on how to plan such training programs so it could be done regularly.

The training was effective in reducing the stress levels among the participants

| Time Point          | Mean (SD) Stress Score |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Baseline            | 133 (23)              |
| Post-test           | No significant change  |
| One month follow up  | 116 (14)              |
| Three months follow up| 117 (19)              |

This finding was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). This showed that such group intervention comprising of 30-40 students would be effective to keep stress levels in check. The concept of this intervention workshop was to sensitize many students in a group about stress. So that their perception about stress would be clear and they could improvise their abilities to deal with stressors. Few suggestions from the students and school authorities regarding the group intervention was collected and was decided to inculcate in future training programs.

The mean (SD) stress scores of participants in the intervention arm at different time points showed a significant decrease. Mean (SD) stress score at pre test (baseline) was 133(23). This mean (SD) score decreased to 116(14) at the first month follow up after the intervention. At the third month follow up, the mean (SD) score was 117(19). These

scores was less than the cut off scores i,e 130

Discussion

The present day world which is said to be a world of achievements is also a world

of stress. Right from the time of the birth till the last breath down, an individual is

invariably exposed to various stressful situations. Stress and coping with stress are

phenomena closely intertwined with human life. They relate to all minor and major

events in life. During the teenage period, between 40% and 70% of adolescents

experience various stressful situations.

In Indian context, when a girl child attains puberty she has set of guidelines given

by her parents to be followed, she is counselled by parents more. She shares all her issues

with parents. But when a boy attains puberty, a sense of hesitation prevails in most of the

boys. Due to which he does not share his changes, feelings with parents. They get

influenced easily by negative information published in media and shared by friends.

Young minds being vulnerable to ill habits adopt them only as a measure of coping.

To enhance adolescent behaviour with positive coping skills of handling various

stressors, intervention research should be conducted. It is a known fact that,

schooling is compulsory for an educated future. Students do have to interact with teachers

and peers daily and relationships are inevitable. Stress management, coping skills, health

education programs should be conducted in schools so they buffer the increasing stress

that every student faces. Our results reveal that the intervention program had significantly reduced stress levels of adolescents from the baseline to post one month follow up and from post one month follow up to post third month follow up. Also, after the intervention program many adolescents reported this program had helped them to effectively deal with stress, reduced their academic difficulties, improve their understandings with peers, parents and they learnt how to be confident. The concept of breathing exercise and positive imagery was liked by them. In terms of cognition, when one tries to escape or avoid stress rather than accepting it. This allows reconsidering the situation and which results in successful coping with stress.

The present results were similar with these previous findings. Though these studies just focussed on group counselling of adolescents, our motive was to make these sessions more student friendly rather than just client – counsellor interactions. So life skills training seemed appropriate to be used for dealing with stress with adolescents. Life skills training were found to be effective in dealing with various adolescent issues. As per our literature search, minimal studies which used life skills to deal with adolescent mental health issues were conducted.

Previous studies have shown that adolescent group members can learn, teach and discuss newly acquired skills for reducing stress among themselves. The present study was a structured group program which was tailored for adolescents and is the first trial providing initial evidence for the effectiveness of life skills training program within the Indian school setting. The program was found to be feasible and acceptable, as reflected by high retention rates, good response rates and the positive feedback received from the participants

A limitation of our study was that no separate control group was allotted. A longer follow-up period in such studies would help to further assess the effectiveness of the program. When we discuss about adolescent stressors, their parents and teachers also play a significant role. It can be recommended that perception of parents and teachers could also be included in future studies

Although life skills were able to modulate the adolescent’s thought process and deal effectively with stress, it solely does not imply that it could act as a buffer to all other environmental factors. Hence, certain organizational level changes and parent-centric and teacher-centric interventions need to be introduced
