# Title: How do sleepwear and bedding fibre types affect sleep quality: A systematic review

## Summary: This systematic review evaluates how different types of sleepwear and bedding materials influence sleep quality by affecting skin and body temperature. The review includes nine studies comparing various fibre types such as cotton, polyester, wool, and blended materials. Findings suggest that blended sleepwear may benefit specific populations, while wool sleepwear aids sleep onset in adults under varying temperature conditions. Additionally, linen sheets improve sleep quality in warm conditions, and goose down duvets enhance slow-wave sleep in cooler environments. The review highlights the complexity of the relationship between fibre types and sleep quality, emphasizing the need for standardized research methodologies to better understand these effects.
