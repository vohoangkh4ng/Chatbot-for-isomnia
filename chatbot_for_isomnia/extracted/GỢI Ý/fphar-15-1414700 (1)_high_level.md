# Title: Effectiveness and safety of East Asian herbal medicine for menopausal insomnia: a systematic review and meta-analysis

## Summary: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness and safety of East Asian herbal medicines (EAHMs) in treating menopausal insomnia, which significantly affects women's quality of life. The study analyzed 70 randomized controlled trials involving 6,035 participants, finding that EAHMs notably improved sleep quality and reduced menopausal symptoms compared to sedative-hypnotics. EAHMs were also associated with fewer adverse reactions, indicating a generally safer profile. However, the certainty of evidence was assessed as moderate to low, suggesting the need for further research with diverse populations and rigorous methodologies.
