# Title: Has the “Double Reduction” policy relieved stress? A follow-up study on Chinese adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of China's "Double Reduction" policy, which aims to alleviate academic stress by reducing homework and off-campus training for students. The research involved 28,398 elementary and junior high school students and assessed changes in mental health, specifically depressive and anxiety symptoms, before and after the policy's implementation. Results indicated a significant decrease in these symptoms post-policy, with factors such as increased sleep duration, reduced homework, and greater parental involvement identified as protective against mental health issues. The findings suggest that the policy has positively influenced students' mental health, highlighting the importance of balancing academic demands with well-being.
