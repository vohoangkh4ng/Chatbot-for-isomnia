# Title: Duration Isnâ€™t Everything. Healthy Sleep in Children and Teens: Duration, Individual Need and Timing

## Summary: This commentary discusses the recent consensus statement by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine regarding recommended sleep durations for children and adolescents. It emphasizes that while sleep duration is important, factors such as individual sleep needs, timing of sleep episodes, and signs of inadequate sleep are equally crucial for optimal sleep health. The authors critique the broad recommendations provided, suggesting that they lack specificity and do not adequately address the complexities of sleep as a psychophysiological phenomenon. The commentary calls for a more nuanced understanding of sleep health that incorporates these additional variables to better inform caregivers and health providers.
