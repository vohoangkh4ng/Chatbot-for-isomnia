# Title: Efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Adolescents: A Randomized Controlled Trial with Internet Therapy, Group Therapy and A Waiting List Condition

## Summary: This article presents a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) in adolescents. The study involved 116 adolescents who were assigned to either internet therapy, group therapy, or a waiting list condition. Results indicated significant improvements in sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and total sleep time for both treatment groups compared to the waiting list, with effects maintained at follow-up. The findings suggest that CBTI is effective for treating insomnia in adolescents, with comparable outcomes for internet and group therapy.
