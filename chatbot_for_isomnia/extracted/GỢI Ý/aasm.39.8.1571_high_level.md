# Title: Cost-Effectiveness of Group and Internet Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Adolescents: Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial

## Summary: This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) delivered in group and Internet formats for adolescents. Conducted as a randomized controlled trial, the research compares the effects and costs of both treatment modalities over a one-year period. Results indicate that while both formats yield similar therapeutic outcomes, Internet CBTI is more cost-effective than group CBTI. The findings underscore the potential for broader dissemination of Internet-based therapies to address the high prevalence of insomnia among adolescents, which is often linked to significant negative consequences in daily life. Further research is recommended to explore effectiveness across different subgroups.
