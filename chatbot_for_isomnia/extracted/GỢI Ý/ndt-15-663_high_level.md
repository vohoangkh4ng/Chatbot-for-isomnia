# Title: Effects of Melatonin in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder with Sleep Disorders After Methylphenidate Treatment

## Summary: This study investigates the effectiveness of melatonin as a treatment for sleep disorders in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who experience sleep issues after being treated with methylphenidate (MPH). The research involved 74 children and assessed sleep disorder severity before and after a 4-week melatonin treatment. Results indicated a significant improvement in sleep disorders, with 60.8% of participants responding positively to melatonin. The treatment was well tolerated, showing no reported side effects, suggesting that melatonin may be a safe and effective option for managing sleep problems in this population, regardless of age, gender, or comorbidities.
