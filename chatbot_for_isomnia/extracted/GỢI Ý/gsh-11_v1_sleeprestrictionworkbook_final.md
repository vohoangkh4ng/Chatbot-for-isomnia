Tip
As you work through the booklet, feel free to make notes on the pages and use the “notes” page at the back What is sleep restriction?
===========================

Introduction
------------

Sleep restriction involves trying to get the number of hours that you spend in bed as near as possible to the number of hours you are actually sleep. The aim of this workbook is to help you increase the amount of time spent not just in bed but asleep by:

- Improving the depth and continuity of your sleep
- Developing more synchronised sleep cycles
- And improving your association with your bed and sleeping

Is sleep restriction for me?
-----------------------------

You can decide together with your practitioner whether this is something you feel would be beneficial for you. Sleep restriction is a very strict process that you must stick to in order for it to be successful, which can be quite a commitment.

We recommend that you try the sleep hygiene workbook first, so that we can address any of these issues before we look at sleep restriction, as it may not always be needed for everyone. The importance of association
==============================

Do you associate bed with sleep?
If we spend lots of time in bed not asleep – e.g wishing we were asleep or worrying that we are not asleep and how we might feel the next day – then we start to associate our bed with those negative feelings of worry and frustration. Our bed then becomes a place we start to dislike, which makes sleeping in it even harder because we start to dread going to bed.

We want to look forward to going to bed and associate it with the positive feelings of getting a good night’s sleep. Therefore, the association between our bed and sleep plays an important role in how well we sleep.

How will restricting my sleep help me sleep?
You may wonder why we would want you to ‘restrict your sleep further’. Our aim is to increase your drive for sleep by initially restricting the amount of time in bed and ensuring the time in bed is spent asleep – not doing anything else.

Reflection
Do you have a good association with your bed? If not think about what else you use your bed for and how you can ensure you only use it for sleep. Is this the right approach for me?
Sleep clinics
Our sleep restriction workbook is based on CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for insomnia) and is recommended for people with insomnia, not other sleep difficulties.
Difficulties such as the below are best treated through a sleep clinic. If you believe you have one of the below, please consult with your GP.
- Restless leg syndrome
- Night terrors
- Sleepwalking
- Narcolepsy
- Sleep apnoea

Medication
If you have been prescribed sleep medication by your GP, and have been taking this to aid your sleep, we would generally not consider you for sleep restriction.
This is because the effectiveness of the sleep restriction is limited if you are relying on sleep medication. Please discuss with your therapist and GP about how best to move forward. # Sleep hygiene

## Top tips for the daytime
There may be things that you can consider changing within your day that could help you get a better night’s rest.
- Avoid daytime sleep.
- Exercise – aim to exercise during the day (preferably outdoors) and avoid exercise late at night as it stimulates endorphins that may keep you awake.
- Limit use of stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine before bed – caffeine can take up to six hours to leave your system.
- Avoid using your bed for other activities other than sleep or sexual activity e.g. reading, smoking, listening to the radio, watching TV.
- Appetite – avoid going to bed too hungry or too full.

Tip
If you have a medical problem, which you think may be impacting on your sleep, see your GP. ## Sleep hygiene

### Top tips for bedtime
There are also things we can change around bedtime that may help you get a good night’s sleep.
- Establish a routine – go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time every morning, even if you feel tired or sleepy.
- Ensure the bedroom conditions are quiet, cool, dark and comfortable.
- Try to avoid worrying about not getting enough sleep – trying to make yourself go to sleep just keeps you awake.
- Relax before going to bed. This could mean having a hot bath, listening to relaxing music, having a hot milky drink (caffeine-free) or doing a relaxation exercise.
- If you have not managed to sleep after roughly 30 minutes, get up and go to a different room and do something quiet and un-stimulating until you feel sleepy.
- Avoid doing stimulating things before bed such as watching TV.
- Avoid looking at the clock while trying to sleep – this will only make you worry.
- Don’t expect too much from your sleep – you may not need as much sleep as you think.

### Reflect
Before you try sleep restriction, have you tried all the above? What still needs to be worked on? ## Sleep restriction

### How do I improve my sleep with sleep restriction?

When trying to tackle problems with sleep, a useful tool is a sleep diary. This will give you a more realistic indication of how much sleep you are getting each night and what factors might be affecting this.

You may think that you are already aware of what is impacting your sleep and how much sleep you are having, but this first step is a really important step that we encourage everyone to complete.

- Step 1 – Fill in a sleep diary
- Step 2 – Review sleep efficiency
- Step 3 – Decide on a sleep window
- Step 4 – Apply your sleep window, record your diary

We will work through the four steps within the next pages.

Even if we don’t usually find it helpful to write things down, this can be a form of avoidance. We cannot fully tackle our sleep issues without being able to clearly, factually see how much sleep we are getting. Try to use the diary for at least three days and see how it goes. ## Improving your sleep

### Step 1. Fill in the sleep diary

When trying to tackle problems with sleep, a useful tool is a sleep diary. This will give you a more realistic indication of how much sleep you are getting each night and what factors might be affecting this. Using the diary on the following page, record your sleep for one week, making your timings as accurate as possible whilst not clock watching.

It’s helpful to include:
- Naps within the day
- Any stimulants you’ve had e.g. tea, coffee, alcohol
- Worries you notice # Sleep diary

| Date  | Naps      | Possible stimulants:              | Time in bed | Estimated time to fall asleep | Wake up time | Total sleep hours | Other notes             | Overall sleep quality: |
|-------|-----------|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| 17th Jan | 2-2:30pm | • Medication (name, amount taken, times)
• Caffeine (volume and times)
• Alcohol (no. of units/volume and times) | 30 minutes  | 1 hour                        | 07:15        | 5 hours           | Woke 3 times, 30 mins each, worried about finances. | Average               |
|       | 30 mins   | Coffee at 10am, 1pm and 3:30pm – 350ml each time.
250ml glass of wine 8pm. |             |                               |              |                   |                         |                       | ## Improving your sleep

### Step 2. Review sleep efficiency

Once you have completed your sleep diary, your therapist will talk you through how to calculate your sleep efficiency. We would recommend that you ask your therapist for a copy of the sleep efficiency spreadsheet so that you can continue to work out your sleep efficiency once your treatment has ended.

### Sleep efficiency below 85%

If your therapist has determined your sleep efficiency is below 85%, they will suggest you continue to Step 3 on the next page.

### Sleep efficiency above 85%

If your sleep efficiency is above 85%, we would consider your sleep to be efficient enough already and therefore your therapist will discuss with you whether sleep restriction is needed at this stage. Improving your sleep
Step 3. Decide on a sleep window
A ‘sleep window’ refers to the period of time we will allow for sleep during sleep restriction. This is based on the average number of hours slept from your sleep diary (i.e. not the average time in bed).

John’s sleep window
- John’s average time in bed for the week of his sleep diary was 10 hours.
- John’s average time asleep however was six hours so this was set as his sleep window time.
- John decided to set his sleep window as 12am to 6am.

Key considerations
Whilst your sleep window time is set based on your sleep diary, there are a few things to consider when setting your sleep window timings.
- When do you start to feel tired?
- What time do you need to be up in the morning?
- What times is it light/dark outside (if this impacts you)?

In addition to the above:
- We recommend a minimum sleep window of five hours.
- Your sleep window should remain the same every night whilst in treatment. If you are a shift worker or have other concerns with this, please speak to your therapist.
- You should see your timings as the very earliest you can go to bed and the very latest you can wake up. Tired before your bedtime? You must wait until the bedtime starts. Reached bedtime and not feeling sleepy? Only go to bed once you feel sleepy, but still wake up at the same time. ## Improving your sleep

### Step 4. Apply your sleep window and record your sleep diary

Once your sleep window is established, work with that sleep window for one week – each night, whilst remembering to keep sleep diaries. After one week, or in the next session with your therapist, you will re-calculate your sleep efficiency and sleep window based on the latest sleep diary as below.

If your sleep efficiency is…

| Sleep Efficiency | Action |
|------------------|--------|
| Below 80%        | Decrease your sleep window by 15 minutes. In John’s example he would decrease his 12am – 6am sleep window to either 12am – 5.45am or 12.15am – 6am. |
| 80 – 85%         | Leave your sleep window the same and continue to keep a sleep diary. |
| 86% +            | Increase your sleep window by 15 minutes. In John’s example he would either increase his 12am – 6am sleep window to 11.45pm – 6am or 12am – 6.15am. |

Repeat steps 3-4 as necessary until you reach a sleep efficiency of 90% or feel that your sleep is now good and no longer an issue. ## Thoughts

How do our thoughts affect our sleep?
It is also important to consider how our thoughts can impact our sleep.
When we have had difficulties sleeping for a long period of time, we can get stuck in some negative thought cycles.

Here’s an example:

| Thoughts                                   |
|--------------------------------------------|
| “If I don’t sleep well                      |
| “I will not be able to                     |
| function tomorrow”                         |

| Physical symptoms                          | Emotions   |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|
| Heart palpitations                         | Anxiety    |
| Feeling hot                                | Low mood   |
| Lack of concentration                      |            |

| Behaviours                                 |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Avoiding                                   |
| Cancelling                                 |
| Generally doing less                       |
| Worry                                      |

Myth busting
Everyone’s need for sleep is different.
The average adult sleep duration varies from 5-10 hours per
night. It is also normal that as we age, we need less sleep and tend to expend less energy day-to-day. It’s therefore normal for your sleep to be less than previous years and does not always mean it’s a problem. Additional workbooks
