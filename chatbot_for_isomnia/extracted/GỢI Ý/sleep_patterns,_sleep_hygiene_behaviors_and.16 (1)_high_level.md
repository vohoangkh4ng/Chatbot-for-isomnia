# Title: Sleep patterns, sleep hygiene behaviors and parental monitoring among Bahrain-based Indian adolescents

## Summary: This study investigates the sleep patterns, hygiene practices, and parental monitoring of Indian adolescents in Bahrain. It highlights that many adolescents are not achieving the recommended 9.25 hours of sleep due to various factors, including societal demands and inadequate sleep practices. The research involved 145 adolescents aged 11 to 17 and found significant differences in sleep duration between school days and weekends, as well as the impact of parental monitoring on sleep duration. The findings indicate a high prevalence of insufficient sleep and irregular bedtimes, suggesting a need for interventions to improve sleep hygiene and overall health among adolescents.
