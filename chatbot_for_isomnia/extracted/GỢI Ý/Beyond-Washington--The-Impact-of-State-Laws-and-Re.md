Beyond Washington: The Impact of State Laws and Regulations on Dietetics Practice

s critical to our profession’s fu- ture as licensure is, and in addi- Ation to the variety of national legislative and policy issues ADA ad- dresses, we also need to think—and act—together on other state matters related to dietetics. Opportunities for success in state advocacy represent an excellent example of ADA’s strategic value of Collaboration.

“STATE” THE CASE
Judith A. Gilbride
In the words of ADA’s Task Force on State Food, Nutrition, and Health Pol- icies: “Because of the impact of state decisions on their livelihoods, dietetics professionals are dramatically affected by the application and interpretation of state food, nutrition, and health laws. . . . (S)tate laws help determine public access to nutrition services, authorize fees for recognition, and affect professional status and income oppor- tunities. . . . The dietetics profession does not have the luxury of focusing on a single state issue, such as licensure, despite its value to the health of the public and significance to the member- ship. Being an effective player in the state public policy arena requires a government relations program that con- sistently addresses a broad view of nutrition and the dietetics aspects of policies, programs, and issues related to food, nutrition, and health of concern to ADA members.”

STAY VIGILANT
State initiatives challenge us to both know existing health care facility reg- ulations and to monitor new rule- making as states prepare for transi- tioning to community care options. While ADA can and will follow this issue at the national level and com- ment on the federal regulations as needed, it is essential that members also stay vigilant and address issues like these in your states.

HARNESSING POWER
How? First, be informed. ADA’s Policy Initiatives and Advocacy group posts state regulatory information on www.eatright.org that will assist you in locating health care facility and program licensing regulations. Most states require either a licensed dieti- tian or a registered dietitian (RD) for hospitals and long-term care institu- tions, but some states post regula- tions with reference to diet or nutri- tion without mentioning RDs. States are also generating legislation to improve children’s food choices through nutrition and physical activity in schools and community programs.

Local vigilance may eventually change the outcomes of legislation and rule- making in your state. In my conversa- tions with affiliate leaders, they tell of major victories—such as how Alabama was able to include the requirement of a state-licensed dietitian in assisted- living facilities—that were accomplished by relatively few people. Or Ohio, where after 8 years of advocacy, medical nutrition therapy just became a Medicaid-covered service when pro- vided to pregnant or postpartum women who have a medical need for a therapeutic diet. Think what we could accomplish in the states by harnessing the power of close to 65,000 members.

DEEPER UNDERSTANDING
ADA’s Public Policy Workshop (PPW) offers sessions on state issues as well as national legislation and trends. I espe- cially encourage younger members to attend PPW and establish a deeper un- derstanding and involvement in the rewards of grass-roots efforts of ADA membership—and leadership. No matter what stage of your career you are in, or what state you live in, come together to collaborate with your colleagues, align yourselves in a com- mon cause, and, in every state, make the voices of ADA members heard.
