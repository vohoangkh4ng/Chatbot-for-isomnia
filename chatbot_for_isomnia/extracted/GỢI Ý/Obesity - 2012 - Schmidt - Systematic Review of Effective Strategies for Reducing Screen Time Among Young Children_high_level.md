# Title: Systematic Review of Effective Strategies for Reducing Screen Time Among Young Children

## Summary: This article presents a systematic review of strategies aimed at reducing screen time among children under 12 years of age. It highlights the prevalence of screen-media use, particularly among lower-income and minority families, and its potential adverse effects on obesity risk. The review analyzed 144 studies, of which 47 met the inclusion criteria, revealing that 29 studies achieved significant reductions in screen time. Effective strategies included electronic monitoring devices and clinic-based counseling. The article also identifies research gaps, such as the need for more studies targeting young children and minorities, and emphasizes the importance of addressing these gaps to enhance the effectiveness of screen time reduction strategies.
