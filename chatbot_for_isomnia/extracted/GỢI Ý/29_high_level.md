# Title: Effect of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms on response to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea: a randomized controlled trial

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) in patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). The research found that while a significant portion of patients reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, these symptoms did not impair the effectiveness of CBTi in improving insomnia symptoms. The findings suggest that patients with COMISA, regardless of comorbid psychological symptoms, should be referred for CBTi to address their insomnia and enhance the management of their sleep apnea.
