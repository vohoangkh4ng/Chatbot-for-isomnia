# Title: Opposing Influences of Affective State Valence on Visual Cortical Encoding

## Summary: This article investigates how positive and negative emotional states influence visual perception, specifically through the modulation of the field of view (FOV) in the visual cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the authors demonstrate that positive affect broadens the FOV, enhancing the processing of peripheral visual information, while negative affect narrows the FOV, reducing the attention to extrafoveal stimuli. The study highlights the differential effects of affective valence on perceptual encoding, suggesting that emotional states can fundamentally alter how visual information is processed in the brain.
