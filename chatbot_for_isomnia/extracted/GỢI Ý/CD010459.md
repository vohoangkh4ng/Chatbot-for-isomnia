Listening to music for insomnia in adults (Review) # Listening to music for insomnia in adults

## A B S T R A C T

### Background
Insomnia is a common problem in modern society. It is associated with reduced quality of life and impairments in physical and mental health. Listening to music is widely used as a sleep aid, but it remains unclear if it can actually improve insomnia in adults. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review published in 2015.

### Objectives
To assess the effects of listening to music on sleep in adults with insomnia and to assess the influence of specific variables that may moderate the effect.

### Search methods
For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and two trials registers up to December 2021. In addition, we handsearched reference lists of included studies, and contacted authors of published studies to identify additional studies eligible for inclusion, including any unpublished or ongoing trials.

### Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of listening to music with no treatment or treatment as usual (TAU) in adults complaining of sleep difficulties.

### Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened records for eligibility, selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included studies. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The primary outcomes were sleep quality, insomnia severity, sleep-onset latency, total sleep time, sleep interruption, sleep efficiency and adverse events. Data on the predefined outcome measures were included in meta-analyses when consistently reported by at least two studies that were homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions and outcomes. We undertook meta-analyses using random-effects models.

### Main results
We included 13 studies (eight studies new to this update) comprising 1007 participants. The studies examined the effect of listening to prerecorded music daily, for 25 to 60 minutes, for a period of three days to three months. The risk of bias within the studies varied, with all studies being at high risk of performance bias, because of limited possibilities to blind participants to the music intervention. Some studies were at high risk of detection bias or other bias. Four studies reported funding from national research councils, three studies reported Cochrane Trusted evidence.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

financial support from university sources and one study reported a grant from a private foundation. Five studies did not report any financial support.

At the end of the intervention, we found moderate-certainty evidence for improved sleep quality measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in the music groups compared to no intervention or TAU (mean difference (MD) −2.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.86 to −1.72; 10 studies, 708 participants). The PSQI scale ranges from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicating poorer sleep. The size of the effect indicates an increase in sleep quality of the size of about one standard deviation in favour of the intervention. We found no clear evidence of a difference in the effects of listening to music compared to no treatment or TAU on insomnia severity (MD −6.96, 95% CI −15.21 to 1.28; 2 studies, 63 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found low-certainty evidence that, compared to no treatment or TAU, listening to music may reduce problems with sleep-onset latency (MD −0.60, 95% CI −0.83 to −0.37; 3 studies, 197 participants), total sleep time (MD −0.69, 95% CI −1.16 to −0.23; 3 studies, 197 participants) and sleep efficiency (MD −0.96, 95% CI −1.38 to −0.54; 3 studies, 197 participants), but may have no effect on perceived sleep interruption (MD −0.53, 95% CI −1.47 to 0.40; 3 studies, 197 participants). In addition, three studies (136 participants) included objective measures of sleep-onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency and sleep interruption and showed that listening to music may not improve these outcomes compared to no treatment or TAU. None of the included studies reported any adverse events.

Authors' conclusions
The findings of this review provide evidence that music may be effective for improving subjective sleep quality in adults with symptoms of insomnia. More research is needed to establish the effect of listening to music on other aspects of sleep as well as the daytime consequences of insomnia.

Music for insomnia in adults

Review question
This review assessed the effects of listening to music on insomnia (sleep problems) in adults and the impact of factors that may influence the effect.

Key messages
We found a beneficial effect of music on sleep quality. For all the other outcomes, we did not find enough good-quality evidence as there were too few participants and the people doing the scoring of the data were aware of the treatment.

What is insomnia?
Worldwide, millions of people experience insomnia. People can have difficulties getting to sleep, staying asleep or may experience poor sleep quality.

Poor sleep affects people's physical and mental health. The consequences of poor sleep are costly, for both individuals and society. Many people listen to music to improve their sleep, but the effect of listening to music is unclear.

What did we do?
We searched electronic databases to identify relevant studies. We included 13 studies with 1007 participants. The studies compared the effect of listening to music to treatment as usual or no treatment. Treatment as usual could be sleep hygiene education (learning a set of rituals to help with sleep) or standard care for participants with insomnia related to chronic medical conditions. The studies examined the effect of listening to prerecorded music daily, for 25 to 50 minutes, for three days to three months. Seven of the included studies reported funding from national research councils or university sources, and one study reported funding from a private foundation. Five studies did not report any funding sources.

What did we find?
Ten studies measured sleep quality, and the results showed that music probably facilitates a large improvement in the quality of sleep compared to no treatment or treatment as usual. We do not know if listening to music has an effect on the severity of insomnia (difficulty in falling or staying asleep) or the number of times a person wakes up (broken sleep) compared to no treatment or treatment as usual. Listening to music may improve slightly sleep-onset latency (how quickly a person falls asleep), sleep duration (length of time a person is asleep) and sleep efficiency (amount of a time a person is asleep compared to the total time spent in bed), compared to no treatment or treatment as usual. None of the studies reported any negative effects caused by listening to music.

What are the limitations of the evidence?
The quality of evidence from the 10 studies that examined sleep quality was moderate. Our confidence in the evidence for the quality of sleep is only moderate because the people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and the people scoring the data. were also sometimes aware of which treatment the participants were getting, which could introduce bias. We have little confidence in the evidence for the severity of insomnia because the studies were very small and were done in different types of people who knew which treatment they were getting. Our confidence in the evidence on sleep-onset latency, sleep duration and sleep efficiency is low because the studies used very different methods to measure these outcomes, and the people in the studies were aware of the nature of the treatment. We have little confidence in the evidence on sleep interruption because the studies used different methods and showed different results. Furthermore, the participants in the studies knew which treatment they were getting.

Future studies should assess other aspects of sleep as well as measures of daytime functioning, such as mood, fatigue, concentration, and quality of life.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence is current to 31 December 2021.

### Description of the condition
Sleep difficulties are highly prevalent in modern society with around 27% of the general population reporting symptoms of insomnia. Insomnia can be defined as a subjective complaint of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep. It is characterised by dissatisfaction with the quality, duration or continuity of sleep, such as problems falling asleep, maintaining sleep, early morning awakenings or complaints of non-restorative sleep. When sleep difficulties persist in a severe form, they are characterised as insomnia disorder, which is the most common sleep disorder. To fulfil the diagnostic criteria of insomnia disorder, one must experience sleep difficulties at least three nights per week for a minimum of three months with associated impairments in daytime functioning or well-being. As such, insomnia disorder can be considered a subgroup within the insomnia definition stated above.

Insomnia is common in people with medical or psychiatric illness and trials have found consistent relationships between insomnia and depression, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric disorders, as well as substance abuse and dependence. Furthermore, insomnia is associated with a number of somatic problems such as decreased immune functioning, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, chronic pain, breathing difficulties, and gastrointestinal and urinary problems. Insomnia itself can have a number of negative daytime consequences and it is well recognised that people with insomnia experience impairments in everyday life such as fatigue and greater irritability. People with insomnia report significantly lower quality of life than those without insomnia, and the reduction in quality of life is correlated with symptom severity. Insomnia affects occupational functioning and social relations and is associated with higher work absenteeism and increased risk of accidents, and therefore represents a condition with great costs for both the individual and society. Estimates of the prevalence of insomnia vary according to the definitions used. One review of epidemiological trials revealed that about one third of the general population experiences symptoms of insomnia, such as difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. When adding daytime consequences to the definition of insomnia, the prevalence rate drops to about 9% to 15%. Using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for insomnia disorder, there is a prevalence of 10.8%. Thus, insomnia disorder can be considered a subgroup within the larger group of people experiencing insomnia. The prevalence of insomnia increases with age and is generally higher in women.

### Description of the intervention
When individuals experience insomnia, they most often do not seek professional help. Instead, many people use various self-help strategies to improve sleep. Some use herbal or dietary products to facilitate sleep, others follow sleep hygiene advice, exercise or relaxation strategies. If the insomnia persists and turns into insomnia disorder with associated daytime impairments, the likelihood of seeking professional help increases, and the most common step is to consult a general practitioner. Healthcare professionals may offer sleep hygiene advice, pharmacotherapy, or psychological and behavioural interventions as treatments for insomnia disorder. Despite widespread use of hypnotics, cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line treatment for insomnia disorder. CBT-I usually consists of several elements, including sleep hygiene, relaxation training, stimulus control therapy, sleep restriction therapy and cognitive therapy. In spite of good results, psychological and behavioural treatments appear to be underutilised, perhaps because they require considerable time and effort for the patient. Furthermore, there is a problem of availability, with relatively few well-trained professionals in the field. Online solutions are being tested, but are still not broadly available. Therefore, pharmacotherapeutic interventions are still commonly used. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists have been approved for the treatment of insomnia disorder by the US Food and Drug Administration, and trials report beneficial short-term effects of these agents. With the exception of eszopiclone, approved use is limited to 35 days or less. However, there are some concerns about the long-term use of these medications, due to risk of abuse, dependence, and adverse effects such as residual daytime sedation, cognitive impairments, and reduced motor co-ordination. Furthermore, the use of hypnotics has been associated with increased mortality. Given the current limitations of psychological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia disorder and the tendency of most people to not seek professional treatment when experiencing difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, self-help strategies are the most common approach to combat insomnia in adults. Among these, listening to music is commonly used by adults to improve sleep, and a simple Google search on 'music' and 'sleep' reveals a huge market of music that is promoted for its sleep-inducing properties. However, the efficiency of music as an intervention for insomnia remains unclear. Music is used as a therapeutic intervention in a number of areas, including pain relief, psychiatry, neuro-rehabilitation, and for improving psychological outcomes in medical conditions such as cancer and heart disease. Experimental and clinical studies show that music can affect autonomous nervous system functioning, as well as psychological factors such as mood and attention; as such, it may potentially impact sleep. Research on the impact of music on sleep has evolved since the early 2000s, and methods for applying music listening to improve sleep quality vary across trials. Generally, the intervention involves the use of prerecorded music in relation to sleep initiation. Music listening can be used passively, or it can be used actively with specific instructions (e.g. relaxation instructions). The duration of the intervention period and the time spent listening to music may vary. The choice of music may be determined by the researcher or by the participants themselves.

### How the intervention might work
Music has been found to influence human beings on many levels, and the impact of music listening on sleep has been attributed to different mechanisms. Several authors argue that improvement of sleep is obtained because slow soothing Cochrane Trusted evidence.

music enhances relaxation. This suggestion is substantiated by trials showing reduced levels of cortisol as an effect of music listening, and changes in autonomous measures such as heart rate and blood pressure. These trials show that music can affect various physiological measures that reflect autonomic nervous system activity, and as such, slow soothing music may lead to a decrease in sympathetic arousal and thus improve sleep. From a psychological perspective, trials have shown that listening to music can reduce anxiety and stress responses, which can lead to greater relaxation and improvement of sleep. Another possible mechanism for the effect of music on sleep is the distracting power of music. Music can function as a focal point of attention that distracts from stressful thoughts and thereby improves sleep. Other researcher-proposed mechanisms include entrainment, masking of noise, enjoyment, expectations (positive or negative beliefs about the effect) and conditioning (building up an association between the music and sleep). However, the relevance of the mechanisms have not yet been tested empirically. A number of individual factors are also likely to influence the music experience, such as age and sex, music preference, musical training, and culture. Therefore, different effects may be found depending on the type of music used, the aetiology of insomnia symptoms, and the length and duration of the intervention.

Why it is important to do this review
Music is commonly used to relieve sleep problems and the use of music as a non-pharmacological intervention offers potential advantages of easy administration, low cost and safety. Clinical trials have been performed to investigate the effect of music on sleep, but it remains unclear if the existing evidence is rigorous enough to reach conclusions about the general efficacy of the intervention. A systematic review is needed to establish the efficacy of music listening for improvement of sleep quality and thereby refute or validate the popular belief that music is helpful to promote sleep. This review is an update of the Cochrane Review published in 2015. The first version included only six trials. As there are several new RCTs published, an update has become necessary to provide a solid and up-to-date overview of the effect of music for insomnia.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies
The methods of this review were prespecified in the protocol. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for inclusion in the review. Since it is not possible to blind participants to the treatment (music), we included unblinded or single-blinded trials.

Types of participants
We included adults with a complaint of sleep difficulties, as documented by standardised measures (e.g. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), or reports or diaries kept by participants, relatives or other informants; or poor sleep documented by objective measures (e.g. polysomnography (PSG) or actigraphy); or individuals diagnosed with an insomnia disorder by standard diagnostic criteria, such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD).

Types of interventions
We included any intervention that comprised listening to prerecorded music with or without relaxation instructions. The intervention could be self-administered or administered by research or clinical personnel. Interventions included music listening compared with a no music control group or treatment as usual (TAU), and music listening added to TAU compared to TAU alone. No intervention control groups could be waitlist controls, and TAU could be sleep hygiene education or standard care for participants with insomnia related to chronic medical conditions.

Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
Our outcomes of interest were sleep- and insomnia-related symptoms as measured by sleep diaries, PSG, actigraphy or by standardised scales for the assessment of sleep and insomnia symptoms (e.g. PSQI or Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)). Furthermore, to establish the safety of the intervention, we considered the reporting of adverse events as a primary outcome. The primary outcomes were:

1. sleep quality;
2. insomnia severity;
3. sleep-onset latency;
4. total sleep time;
5. sleep interruption (number of awakenings and waking after sleep onset);
6. sleep efficiency (percent of time in bed spent asleep);
7. adverse events (as reported by trialists; e.g. discomfort or hearing loss).

Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes of interest were waking-related correlates and daytime consequences of insomnia. The relevant measures were:
1. psychological outcomes:
a. depression;
b. anxiety;
c. quality of life;
2. physical outcomes:
a. fatigue;
b. daytime sleepiness; Cohrane Trusted evidence.
Informed decisions.
Better health.

3. physiological outcomes:
a. heart rate;
b. heart rate variability;
c. blood pressure.

We included trials that measured psychological outcomes by standardised questionnaires with established reliability and validity (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck 1996), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger 1983), 36-item Short-Form (SF-36) health survey (Ware 1992)). We included trials that measured physical outcomes with standardised procedures such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) or validated rating scales. We included trials that measured physiological outcomes with standardised procedures such as an electrocardiogram (ECG). We considered the trial period and follow-up as described in the included trials. When assessing outcomes in relation to time points, we grouped the data as: immediate postintervention, short-term (postintervention to one month), medium-term (between one and three months' follow-up), and long-term (more than three months' follow-up) effects. We reported all primary outcomes in Summary of findings 1.

Search methods for identification of studies
For this update, we revised the previous search strategies to take account of new indexing terms in MEDLINE, and included some additional free-text terms (see Differences between protocol and review). Following the guidelines in Chapter 4 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, we searched each source from inception, and applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status when searching for trials or when deciding on trial inclusion. Details of the previous search strategies are available in Jespersen 2015.

Searching other resources
We checked relevant reviews and the reference lists of the included studies to identify additional trials missed by the electronic searches. We also contacted authors and experts in the field for additional information on unpublished trials or to request additional data. For this update, we did not handsearch specialist journals, since most are now indexed in the electronic databases. Furthermore, our handsearch for the first version did not yield any additional trials.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies
Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts using Covidence. We retrieved all papers for which the title or abstract referred to an RCT on music and sleep in full text. In cases where there was insufficient information in the title or abstract to determine the relevance of a paper, we retrieved the full text. Both review authors independently reviewed the full-text papers against the previously defined inclusion criteria, to assess the trial's eligibility for inclusion. We discussed disagreements until we reached consensus. We recorded excluded articles and the reason for their exclusion. We reported the selection process in a PRISMA diagram.

Data extraction and management
Two review authors, who were blinded to each other's assessment, extracted data using Covidence. The Covidence template was adjusted and piloted prior to use, to ensure it matched the nature of our outcomes. We resolved disagreements by consensus. If outcome data were not available, we contacted the authors of the trial.

## Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (KVJ and VPN) independently assessed the risk of bias using the tool described (and the criteria outlined) in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. They solved disagreements by discussion with the fourth review author. When information for evaluating methodological criteria was absent, we contacted the study authors to request further information. We rated each trial at high, low or unclear risk of selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment); performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel); detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting) and risk of other bias. With reference to each of these domains, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it likely to impact the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses. We used this information to evaluate the impact of risk of bias for each outcome in the GRADE assessment, so that high risk of bias in one or more domains resulted in a reduced GRADE rating. Similarly, an unclear risk of bias in one or more domains could reduce the GRADE rating if it presented limitations that would lower confidence in the estimate of the effect.

## Measures of treatment effect
We used Review Manager Web for data entry and analyses.

### Continuous data
We analysed continuous outcomes measured on the same scale between trials (e.g. PSQI) using the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

### Ordinal data
We analysed ordinal data measured on scales (i.e. sleep quality on visual analogue scales) as continuous data and the intervention effect was expressed as MDs with 95% CIs. When possible, we checked the distributions for normality.

### Unit of analysis issues
#### Cluster-randomised trials
We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials.

#### Cross-over trials
We did not identify any cross-over trials.

#### Trials with more than two treatment arms
If a trial reported multiple treatment arms, we only used comparisons between the music intervention and the control or TAU group.

### Dealing with missing data
We noted levels of attrition in the incomplete outcome data section of the risk of bias tables (within the Characteristics of included studies table). Where information about the presented data set was missing in the trial reports, or if there was a lack of detail or a discrepancy between different reports, or clarification was needed, we tried to retrieve relevant information by contacting the authors.

of the trial. Where data were missing due to loss to follow-up or dropout, we attempted to obtain complete outcome data from trial authors to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. If any outcome data remained missing, or if trial authors did not respond within a reasonable time, we analysed data on an available-case basis, based on the numbers of participants for whom outcome data (continuous and dichotomous) were known. We did not impute missing data. For more information on how we will deal with missing data in future updates of this review, see Jespersen 2013 and Appendix 3.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed clinical and methodological heterogeneity by examining the characteristics of the trials. The similarities between interventions (e.g. dose, frequency), participants (e.g. age), trial design (e.g. allocation concealment, blinding, losses to follow-up) and the outcomes are reported in the Included studies subsection. We assessed heterogeneity of treatment response visually from the forest plot of the MD and the ChiX test. In addition, we assessed heterogeneity statistically according to the standard method using the IX statistic, calculated for each comparison on each outcome. There was substantial heterogeneity if the IX statistic was greater than 50%, indicating that 50% of the variability in the outcome cannot be explained by sampling variation. For further information on how we will deal with heterogeneity in future updates of this review, see Jespersen 2013 and Appendix 3.

Assessment of reporting biases
We attempted to minimise the potential for publication bias by our comprehensive search strategy that included evaluating published and unpublished literature.

Where we suspected reporting bias, we contacted trial authors asking them to provide missing outcome data. For further information on how we will deal with reporting bias in future updates of this review, see Jespersen 2013 and Appendix 3.

Data synthesis

We entered all trials included in the systematic review into Review Manager Web (Review Manager Web 2021), and checked for data entry errors. We conducted a meta-analysis using the inverse variance method when there were data from at least two included trials. We undertook meta-analyses using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. Where there was agreement between the results of both analyses, we reported the results from random-effects model, as it conveys the variability better. If fixed-effect and random-effects models revealed different results, we investigated possible sources of heterogeneity or inconsistency among trials in the magnitude or direction of effects. When data were not available for a meta-analysis, we synthesised the results narratively.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We conducted the following subgroup analyses (ranked in order of importance).

1. Duration of the intervention (short: one to four days, medium: five to 20 days, long: 21 days or more).
2. Aetiology of insomnia.
3. Researcher-selected music versus participant choice among preselected music.
4. Music listening alone versus music listening with relaxation instructions.

The subgroup analyses were exploratory and conducted as recommended in Chapter 9 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The subgroup analyses are presented in the Effects of interventions section with each outcome.

For further information on other intended subgroup analyses, see Jespersen 2013.

Sensitivity analysis

We conducted sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of risk of bias on the results of the meta-analyses by excluding trials rated at unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment as recommended in Chapter 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

For additional information on other intended sensitivity analyses, see Jespersen 2013 and Appendix 3.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence
We summarised the primary outcomes in Summary of findings 1. The primary outcomes included sleep quality, insomnia severity, sleep-onset latency, total sleep time, sleep interruption, sleep efficiency and adverse events. The table included end-of-treatment effects of the comparison between the music intervention and TAU or no-intervention control group. We rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach for each outcome. Two review authors independently performed assessments and resolved disagreements by discussion until reaching consensus. We gave evidence from RCTs an initial high-certainty rating, but downgraded the assessment if the trial methodology was at risk of bias, if there was substantial inconsistency among the results, if the evidence was indirect or imprecise or if there was evidence of publication bias. We used GRADEpro GDT software to produce the table. The GRADE rating reflects how certain we are that the estimate reflects the true effect of the intervention.

Listening to music for insomnia in adults (Review) After screening titles and abstracts, we identified 88 records that were considered potentially relevant and retrieved them for further examination. One potentially relevant trial was published by two of the authors of this review. To avoid the influence of dual authorship, two authors with no involvement in the trial assessed the eligibility, extracted data and evaluated the certainty of evidence from this trial, including risk of bias assessment. We excluded 69 full-text reports (see Excluded studies), and included eight new studies (from nine reports) in the review. In addition, we found eight protocols for relevant ongoing studies, and two studies (from three reports) are awaiting classification because of insufficient information to assess inclusion.

In total, we included 13 trials in this updated version of the review. We included six trials in the first version of this review, one of which was excluded in this version because it is a quasi-RCT.

### Included studies

In the present review, we included 13 trials (1007 participants) (see Characteristics of included studies table). Five of these were included in the first version of the review, and we added eight new studies in the current update. All trials used a parallel-group design.

The trials were conducted in eight different countries. Four were conducted in Taiwan, two in Iran, two in China, one in Singapore, one in Hungary, one in Denmark, one in Italy, and one in Austria.

### Trial size

The 13 included trials comprised 1007 participants. Trial sample sizes ranged from 30 to 159 participants, with a mean sample size of 77 (median 64). One trial had a small sample size of 30 participants, three trials included between 121 and 159 participants, and the remaining nine studies had sample sizes between 48 and 68.

### Setting

In 10 of the included trials, the participants used the music listening intervention in their own home. One trial offered participants a live music session once a week in addition to listening to music at home. Three trials telephoned participants once or twice a week to ensure compliance with the protocol. One study used twice weekly telephone calls to ensure compliance, one study called participants every second day, and one study sent daily text reminders to the participants. One trial telephoned the intervention group but not the control group once a week to assess compliance.

Of the remaining three trials, one was conducted in a sleep laboratory, and two trials implemented the intervention at an inpatient rehabilitation facility for people with low-back pain and poststroke rehabilitation.

### Participants

The participants in the included trials were between 18 and 83 years of age. One trial did not report gender, and one study included only men, whereas another focused on pregnancy. Cochrane Trusted evidence.

related insomnia and included only women. Two studies had an even gender distribution, but in most studies, the majority of participants were women (70% to 80%). One study had mostly men.

Two studies included participants with insomnia disorder according to the DSM-5 or ICSD. The remaining studies stated that they recruited participants with complaints of insomnia. Most trials used scores greater than five on the PSQI as evidence of sleep difficulties. One trial did not include sleep difficulties as an inclusion criterion, but all participants had PSQI scores greater than five, indicating sleep problems. The severity of the sleep difficulties varied, with mean PSQI scores at baseline ranging from 6.8 to 14.9. Six trials reported mean baseline scores around 10.

The target populations in the 13 trials were diverse. Two studies included adults with insomnia disorder. Three studies focused on age-related sleep problems, whereas four studies focused on insomnia related to medical conditions. One study focused on pregnancy-related insomnia, another included students with poor sleep, and two studies did not specify their population beyond adults with a complaint of insomnia.

Interventions

All included trials used listening to prerecorded music as the main intervention. Most trials examined the effects of listening to music only; two trials examined listening to music with relaxation instructions, and one trial included weekly live music sessions. All trials used music once a day. Most trials instructed participants to listen to the music at bedtime, and only four trials did not specify what time of the day to listen to the music. The length of the music listening sessions ranged from 25 to 60 minutes, with a mean of 36 minutes. The duration of the intervention ranged from three to 90 days, with two trials having an intervention period of three to four days, and two trials having an intervention period of 90 days. The remaining trials had intervention periods between 14 and 42 days.

Seven trials used researcher-selected music where all participants received the same intervention music. In four trials, the participants had a choice among four or six researcher-created playlists of music in different genres. Similarly, one trial gave the participants access to a large music database with 169 pieces of slow music in various genres and encouraged participants to find their preferred music. One trial encouraged participants to bring their own preferred music for bedtime listening. Those who did not bring their own music listened to music prepared by the researchers. In total, 10 participants listened to their own preferred music and 149 participants listened to music chosen by the researcher.

All trials provided information on the music used in the study. The genres reported were Western and Chinese classical music, Buddhist songs, new age, lullabies, Persian traditional music, Chinese five Elements tone music, eclectic, ambient, popular oldies and jazz. Five trials gave information on the specific recordings used. Two trials stated the pieces of music used, but did not give performance-specific information. Four trials described characteristics of the music. These shared common features such as low tempo (52 beats per minute to 85 beats per minute), stable dynamic structure and no strong rhythmic accentuation.

Seven trials compared the music-listening intervention to a no-treatment control group, and six trials compared music listening adjunctive to TAU versus TAU alone. Four trials had two active intervention groups, but we included only data from the music listening group compared to the no-treatment control group in this review.

Outcomes

Ten trials reported on sleep quality using the PSQI. The PSQI is a commonly used self-report questionnaire with 19 items. From these items, seven component scores are calculated, each with a score from 0 (no problems) to 3 (severe problems), leading to a total score ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate more sleep problems, and a total score greater than 5 indicates poor sleep quality. The seven component scores address specific sleep parameters, including sleep latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, etc.

Two studies assessed insomnia severity using the ISI. The ISI is a well-validated questionnaire consisting of seven items addressing insomnia symptoms that are each rated from 0 to 4. The total score range from 0 to 28 with higher scores indicating more severe insomnia.

Three trials used electroencephalogram (EEG) or full PSG to objectively measure sleep-onset latency, total sleep time, sleep interruption and sleep efficiency. PSG is considered the gold standard of sleep assessment allowing for the scoring of different sleep stages and the transitions between them. This method allows objective measure of the amount of time it takes to fall asleep (sleep-onset latency, measured in minutes) and the total sleep time (measured in minutes). Furthermore, the amount of wake time after sleep onset (measured in minutes) is a measure of sleep interruption, and sleep efficiency refers to the percentage of time spend asleep while in bed (i.e. total sleep time divided by time in bed).

Five trials measured these outcomes subjectively with the PSQI subscales described above.

No trials reported adverse events or deterioration of outcomes during the intervention period. This lack of reporting of adverse events could both reflect that there were no adverse events or that researchers neglected to report them. A few studies. Cochrane Trusted evidence.

reported some of the secondary outcomes. Two studies reported on depressive symptoms, using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Three studies reported on anxiety, where Liu 2016 used the State section of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Amiri 2019 used the anxiety scale of the DASS-21 and Burrai 2020 used the anxiety scale of the HADS. Finally, two studies reported the effect on quality of life using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the psychological subscale of the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF).

Funding sources-item

Eight trials were funded or partly funded by a grant from a national research council, university, government or foundation. Five trials reported no information on funding sources.

Excluded studies

We excluded 69 reports identified by the updated searches. Of these 69, we excluded six trials because they did not have an RCT design (e.g. no control group or no randomisation procedure), and 41 trials because the participants were not adults with insomnia as defined in the Types of participants section (some trials enrolled participants with no sleep problems, some included both good and poor sleepers, and some had no clear documentation of the insomnia problems). We excluded a further 15 trials because the intervention was not listening to music (e.g. choir singing), five trials because they compared two active interventions (e.g. music versus muscle relaxation techniques), and two trials because they did not evaluate any sleep outcome measures. In addition, we excluded one trial included in the original version of the review because it was a quasi-RCT. Twenty-eight excluded trials were ongoing as reported in a trial registry. We selected 27 studies identified for the original review for this update, and reported why they did not meet our eligibility criteria in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. These include the previously included study, Jespersen 2012.

Studies awaiting classification

We identified two potentially relevant trials that could not be assessed due to limited information. One study was identified in the previous version of this review, and it is still awaiting classification. It is an unpublished trial on pain-related sleep difficulties, but the trial is referred to in published material. Still, there is insufficient information to assess the trial for inclusion or exclusion from this review. We contacted the author, who has yet to respond. For this update, we identified another potentially relevant study on personalised music interventions for people with sleep disorders. However, the report included too little information to determine inclusion or exclusion. There were no other publications of the trial found and the author information could not be obtained.

Ongoing studies

Eight relevant studies were still ongoing when this review was written. Three studies focus on sleep problems in elderly people, and two focus on insomnia and depression. Three trials focus on sleep problems in general medicine, sleep-onset insomnia, and pregnancy-related insomnia.

Risk of bias in included studies

We assessed the 13 included trials for risk of bias across the following domains: random sequence generation (selection bias); allocation concealment (selection bias); blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias); blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias); incomplete outcome data (attrition bias); selective reporting (reporting bias); and other bias. The results are depicted in the risk of bias graph. The summary of the risk of bias results for each of the included trials is provided. Reasons for the judgement are described in the risk of bias tables within the Characteristics of included studies table.

## Allocation

### Random sequence generation
Ten trials described the randomisation procedures applied and were at low risk of bias. Three trials stated that the trial was randomised, but did not describe the randomisation procedure and were judged at unclear risk of bias.

### Allocation concealment
Seven trials described measures taken to conceal allocation and were rated at low risk of bias. Five trials had limited information on allocation concealment and were judged at unclear risk of bias. One trial used a block randomisation procedure that enabled researchers to predict group allocation for some participants and was judged at high risk of bias.

### Blinding

#### Blinding of participants and personnel
Due to the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to blind participants and it can be difficult to blind personnel or researchers. Bias was considered likely to have occurred in those trials using subjective reports of sleep quality when participants were not blinded. Bias was considered less likely to have occurred in the trials involving objective measures of sleep, although these trials also included subjective measures of sleep. Therefore, all trials were judged at high risk of performance bias.

#### Blinding of outcome assessment
Eight trials stated that outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation and were at low risk of bias. One trial reported no information on who conducted the rating of the outcome and was judged at unclear risk of bias. Four trials reported no measures taken to blind outcome assessors and were at high risk of bias.

### Incomplete outcome data
Twelve trials were at low risk of bias because they either reported no attrition and no missing data, or accounted well for attrition and missing data that was low and balanced between groups. Two trials did not include the information on attrition in the published report but the authors provided it at our request. One trial had unclear information on attrition and was at unclear risk of bias.

### Selective reporting
There was some uncertainty in two trials about the full reporting of outcomes, so these were at unclear risk of reporting bias. One trial did not include outcome measures for the no-treatment control group in the published report, but the authors provided this information at our request and it did not change the results or conclusions of the published paper. Hence, we did not suspect reporting bias and judged the trial at low risk of reporting bias. There was no indication of selective reporting in the remaining 10 trials, which were at low risk of reporting bias. Overall, we found publicly available protocols for five studies. Three of these were published before study initiation, one was registered during recruitment, and one was registered retrospectively. These are the five most recent trials, and the findings may reflect a growing awareness of the importance of making study protocols of clinical trials available.

### Other potential sources of bias
Three trials had other potential sources of bias. Two trials reported baseline differences between the intervention and control group, and one trial reported methods of data collection differed between the intervention and control group. Thus, these trials were at high risk for other biases. The remaining 10 trials had no risks of other bias and were at low risk of bias.

## Effects of interventions

See: Summary of findings 1 Listening to music compared to no treatment or treatment as usual for adults with insomnia
For an overview, see Summary of findings 1. All outcomes are reported as immediate post-treatment effects. Since we did not have individual participant data, we were unable to verify the distribution of data for continuous outcomes.

### Primary outcomes

#### Sleep quality
Ten trials, comprising 708 participants, reported on sleep quality and were pooled in a meta-analysis. All trials measured sleep quality using the PSQI. The PSQI total scores range from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicating more sleep problems. The results of the analysis revealed an effect in favour of the intervention compared to no treatment or TAU. This shows that the music intervention likely reduces sleep problems by 1.72 to 3.86 points in the PSQI score, and the size of the effect indicates a reduction of sleep problems of approximately one SD in favour of the intervention compared to no treatment or TAU. Heterogeneity was high and this was investigated separately using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Figure 4.

Subgroup analyses
For the sleep quality outcome, the number of included trials enabled us to conduct four of the predefined subgroup analyses.

Duration of the intervention
We explored the influence of the duration of the intervention period in a subgroup analysis comparing medium duration (eight to 21 days) with long duration (22 days and more). There were no studies with a short duration (one to seven days) reporting this outcome. The results of the analysis showed a likely effect of the intervention compared to controls with both intervention durations (medium: MD −2.24, 95% CI −2.90 to −1.58; 5 studies, 343 participants; long: MD −3.36, 95% CI −5.63 to −1.10; 5 studies, 365 participants). There was no clear difference between the two subgroups (ChiX = 0.86, degrees of freedom (df) = 1 (P = 0.35), IX = 0%; Analysis 1.2). Heterogeneity among the medium duration studies was low (I2 = 13%), but very high among the long duration studies (I2 = 90%). The high heterogeneity seems to be mainly due to a larger effect in the Momennasab 2018 study compared to the other studies.

Insomnia aetiology
We explored if the size of the effect was related to the insomnia aetiology in a subgroup analysis. We compared sleep quality in participants with age-related insomnia (Lai 2005; Shum 2014; Wang 2016), insomnia related to a medical condition (Burrai 2020; Kullich 2003; Momennasab 2018), participants with insomnia disorder (Amiri 2019; Jespersen 2019), and pregnancy-related insomnia (Liu 2016). The analysis showed evidence for a likely reduction in sleep problems in favour of the intervention in all four groups and no evidence of a difference in the effect between the subgroups compared to controls (ChiX = 4.59, df = 3 (P = 0.20), IX = 34.6%, 9 studies, 644 participants; Analysis 1.3).

Researcher-selected music versus participant-selected music
Ten studies were included in the subgroup analysis comparing researcher-selected music (Amiri 2019; Burrai 2020; Harmat 2008; Kullich 2003; Momennasab 2018) and participants' choice among researcher selected playlists (Jespersen 2019; Lai 2005; Liu 2016; Shum 2014; Wang 2016). The results of the analysis revealed that, compared to no treatment or TAU, music likely results in a reduction of sleep problems both if the music was selected by the researchers (MD −3.31, 95% CI −5.32 to −1.29; 5 studies, 370 participants), and by the participants based on a preselected choice (MD −2.33, 95% CI −3.37 to −1.29; 5 studies, 338 participants). However, we found no evidence of a difference between the effect of the different subgroups (ChiX = 0.71, df = 1 (P = 0.40), IX = 0%; Analysis 1.4).

Music listening alone versus music listening and relaxation instructions
We were able to compare trials that applied music listening alone (Amiri 2019; Burrai 2020; Harmat 2008; Jespersen 2019; Liu 2016; Momennasab 2018; Shum 2014; Wang 2016) to trials that used music listening and relaxation instructions (Kullich 2003; Lai 2005). The results of the analysis revealed a likely reduction in sleep problems compared to controls, regardless of whether the intervention was applied without relaxation instructions or with relaxation instructions (without: MD −2.85, 95% CI −4.18 to −1.51; 8 studies, 583 participant; with: MD −2.64; 95% CI −3.74 to −1.54; 2 studies, 125 participants). However, we found no evidence of a difference in the effect of the two subgroups (ChiX = 0.05, df = 1 (P = 0.82), IX = 0%; Analysis 1.5).

Summary
In summary, the subgroup analyses do not indicate a crucial role of the duration of the intervention, the aetiology of the sleep problems, the music selection procedures or relaxation instructions on the effect of music for improving sleep quality. Furthermore, the subgroup analyses do not explain the heterogeneity in the meta-analysis including all studies reporting on sleep quality. Mainly, it seems that Momennasab 2018 represents an outlier result in the sense that the effect reported by this study is larger than what is found in the other studies. The subgroup analyses do not suggest that this larger effect is related to any of the parameters explored here, as there are other studies with similar duration, aetiology and music selection showing smaller effect. See Sensitivity analysis section for further exploration of heterogeneity.

## Insomnia severity
Two studies measured insomnia severity including 63 participants with insomnia disorder. Both studies used the ISI to evaluate insomnia severity, with scores ranging from 0 to 28 and higher scores indicating more severe insomnia symptoms. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of music on insomnia severity. A meta-analysis showed no clear evidence of an effect, as the CIs included both a clinically relevant reduction in insomnia severity and a small increase (MD −6.96, 95% CI −15.21 to 1.28; P = 0.10; very low-certainty evidence). Heterogeneity was very high (I2 = 95%). This may relate to the longer intervention period in the study showing the largest effect, or it could relate to different demographic variables. The study included male students with a mean age of 27 (SD 2.5) years, whereas the participants were older (mean 48.4 (SD 8.8) years), with a majority of women (79%).

## Sleep-onset latency
Eight trials reported on sleep-onset latency (SOL) including 457 participants. Three trials reported objective SOL measured with PSG, and five studies reported experienced SOL measured using the PSQI subscale. The three studies using PSG included 136 participants. None of the studies found evidence of an effect of the intervention on objective SOL compared to no treatment or TAU. We could not conduct a meta-analysis because two studies reported the data in a format that did not allow for inclusion.

Five studies, including 321 participants, measured SOL using the PSQI subscale 'Sleep latency'. The scores of this subscale range from 0 to 3 with higher scores reflecting more problems. Three studies reported the results in a format that allowed inclusion in a meta-analysis. The results of this analysis, which included 197 participants, indicate an effect in favour of the music intervention compared to no treatment or TAU (MD −0.60, 95% CI −0.83 to −0.37; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence). This evidence suggests that listening to music may reduce experienced SOL between 0.37 and 0.83 points on this PSQI subscale, with low heterogeneity of the results (I2 = 0%).

A narrative summary of all five studies reporting subjective measures of SOL showed that four of these studies reported improved SOL with the music intervention compared to no treatment or TAU, whereas one study found no difference between the groups.

## Total sleep time
Nine trials, including 611 participants, registered total sleep time. Three studies used PSG, five studies used the PSQI subscale 'Sleep duration' and one study performed a categorial assessment of improvement in sleep duration.

Three studies, including 136 participants, measured objective total sleep time with PSG and found no effect of the music intervention compared to controls. Two studies reported the data in a format that did not allow for inclusion in a meta-analysis.

Five studies reported the results of the PSQI subscale 'Sleep duration'. A meta-analysis including three of these studies with 197 participants found evidence that music listening may improve sleep duration compared to no treatment or TAU (MD −0.69, 95% CI −1.16 to −0.23; P = 0.004; low-certainty evidence). This suggests a reduction between 0.23 and 1.16 points on this subscale ranging from 0 to 3. Heterogeneity was substantial in this analysis (I2 = 70%).

A narrative summary of all five studies reporting subjective measures of total sleep time with the PSQI subscale showed that four of these studies found an effect of the intervention, and one study showed no effect compared with no treatment or TAU. In addition, one study including 154 participants with poststroke insomnia reported ratings of the effect of the intervention in four categories depending on the degree of improvement in sleep duration. They found that more participants in the music group showed improved sleep duration than the control group.

## Sleep interruption
Eight trials with 457 participants reported sleep interruption. Three trials, including 136 participants, measured sleep using PSG and reported wake time after sleep onset and number of awakenings. They found no effect of the intervention on these objective sleep measures compared to no treatment or TAU.

Five trials, including 321 participants, measured sleep interruption using the PSQI subscale 'Sleep disturbance'. A meta-analysis including data from three of these studies showed that music may have no effect on sleep interruption compared with no treatment or TAU, but the evidence is very uncertain. This analysis showed very high heterogeneity. The cause of this heterogeneity seemed to be the discrepancy between the relatively large reduction seen in one study, whereas the two other studies showed no difference in the effect between music and control groups.

A narrative summary of all five studies also showed inconsistency in the results. Three studies reported a reduction in sleep interruption in the music group. whereas two studies found no effect of the intervention, compared to no treatment or TAU. The two studies with no effect included elderly people with sleep problems, and it may be that music is less efficient for improving sleep interruption with this population.

## Sleep efficiency

Eight studies measured sleep efficiency using PSG and the PSQI subscale 'Sleep efficiency'.

The three studies, including 136 participants, using PSG reported no effect of the intervention compared to no treatment or TAU.

A meta-analysis with three studies using the PSQI subscale showed that music listening may improve sleep efficiency compared to no treatment or TAU (MD −0.96, 95% CI −1.38 to −0.54; P < 0.001; 197 participants; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 6.1). The evidence suggests a reduction in sleep efficiency problems between 0.54 and 1.38 points on this scale ranging from 0 to 3 in the music group compared to controls. The analysis showed moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 62%).

A narrative summary including all five studies measuring experienced sleep efficiency showed that all studies reported an effect of the intervention compared to no treatment or TAU.

## Adverse events

No trials reported a deterioration of a primary outcome or reported any other adverse events.

## Secondary outcomes

The secondary outcomes were sleep-related psychological outcomes (depression, anxiety and quality of life), physical outcomes (fatigue, daytime sleepiness and pain), and physiological outcomes (heart rate, heart rate variability and blood pressure). Trials reported three of these outcomes (depression, anxiety and quality of life).

### Depression

Two studies, including 173 participants, reported the effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms. A meta-analysis showed no clear effect of the music intervention on depressive symptoms compared with no treatment or TAU, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD −2.04, 95% CI −4.45 to 0.37; P = 0.10; Analysis 7.1). The evidence suggests a large mean reduction in depressive symptoms, but the CIs were very broad and covered both large reductions and slight increases. Statistical heterogeneity was very high (I2 = 94%). This may relate to differences in the included populations; one study included adults with chronic heart failure and sleep problems, whereas the other included students with insomnia disorder. Furthermore, one study had an intervention period of 90 days compared to 42 days in the other.

### Anxiety

Three studies, including 294 participants, measured anxiety. A meta-analysis found evidence that listening to music may reduce anxiety compared to no treatment or TAU (SMD −0.52, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.28; P < 0.001; Analysis 8.1). This evidence suggests a medium effect size reduction in anxiety symptoms with the music intervention compared to controls. Heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0%).

### Quality of life

Two studies, including 177 participants, reported the effect on quality of life. There was evidence that music may increase quality of life compared to no treatment or TAU (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.85; P < 0.001; Analysis 9.1). This indicates a small-to-large effect of the music intervention compared to no intervention or TAU. Heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0%).

## Sensitivity analyses

We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of risk of bias on the results of the meta-analysis for the outcome of sleep quality. Other outcomes of interest were not considered as there was an insufficient number of studies reporting the outcomes.

First, we excluded trials potentially indicating publication bias. Excluding the study decreased heterogeneity (IX = 36%) and the overall effect size estimate remained similar (MD −2.22, 95% CI −2.83 to −1.62; P < 0.001). The funnel plot clearly identified one study as an outlier, but whether this is due to publication bias was unclear from the plot. It could equally well be due to methodological limitations or clinical aspects. Next, we excluded all studies with potential risk of selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment). Heterogeneity was substantially decreased (IX = 7%) and the overall effect size estimate remained the same (MD −2.71, 95% CI −3.46 to −1.97; P = 0.0001). Further excluding two studies with risk of detection bias resulted in lowest heterogeneity (IX = 0%) while the overall effect size estimate remained similar (MD −2.03, 95% CI −3.08 to −0.98; P = 0.0002). Overall, the sensitivity analyses revealed that accounting for publication bias, and excluding studies with risk of selection bias and detection bias did not change the results of the meta-analyses.

## DISCUSSION

### Summary of main results
We found 13 trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review comprising 1007 participants. These trials evaluated the effect of listening to music for insomnia in adults compared to no treatment or TAU. We conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model for the primary outcome of sleep quality, which 10 trials reported. We found moderate-certainty evidence that listening to music probably improves sleep quality compared to no treatment or TAU. The analysis showed a large effect of about one SD in favour of the intervention. The direction of the results was consistent across the included trials and sensitivity analyses showed that the beneficial effect of the intervention remained unchanged when excluding trials carrying potential risk of selection bias, or detection bias. Subgroup analyses revealed no difference depending on the duration of the intervention, the aetiology of insomnia, whether the music was selected by research personnel or the participant, or whether listening to music was accompanied by relaxation instructions or not. The evidence for the additional primary outcomes was of low or very low certainty. Two studies reported insomnia severity, and the meta-analysis showed no clear evidence of a difference between the intervention and control groups. Sleep-onset latency, sleep duration, sleep interruption and sleep efficiency were measured both objectively by three studies and subjectively by five studies. The objective measures indicated that listening to music may not improve any of these outcomes compared to no treatment or TAU. Three studies with subjective measures were included in a meta-analysis, which showed evidence that listening to music may reduce problems with sleep-onset latency, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency, but may have no effect on sleep interruption, compared to no treatment or TAU. None of the trials reported adverse events. A few studies reported some of the secondary outcomes. Compared with no treatment or TAU, listening to music may result in little to no difference in depressive symptoms, but may improve anxiety and quality of life. For an overview of the results see Summary of findings 1.

### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
Outcomes
Ten trials reported the primary outcome of sleep quality measured with the same questionnaire (PSQI), giving substantial weight for a meta-analysis. The fact that people experienced improvement in sleep quality is important, and the improvement is large enough to be considered clinically relevant. As most trials focused narrowly on subjective sleep quality, there is limited information on other aspects of sleep that might be affected by the intervention. However, five trials reported the PSQI subscales on 'sleep-onset latency', 'total sleep time', 'sleep disturbance' and 'sleep efficacy'. Three of these studies reported the data in a format that could be included in a meta-analysis. Additionally, three studies reported these outcomes using objective sleep measures such as PSG. However, the data format in two of these studies did not allow for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Overall, none of the studies using objective sleep measures reported any effect of the intervention. This is in contrast to the questionnaire data showing a beneficial effect on sleep-onset latency, total sleep time and sleep efficiency. Discrepancies between subjective and objective measures of sleep are commonly reported, particularly among people with sleep difficulties, and it is recommended to document treatment efficacy with multiple outcomes and multiple assessment modalities. The current evidence suggests no effect of music on objective sleep measures, but with only three studies reporting this outcome, it remains unclear if this is a true estimate or related to lack of power to detect more subtle effects of the music intervention or the very short intervention period in two of the studies using objective sleep measures.

The included trials reported three of the predefined secondary outcomes. Two studies reported depression, three reported anxiety and two reported on quality of life. This gives us very limited information and reflects a lack of data on how the music intervention may affect the waking correlates and consequences of insomnia, such as mood, quality of life, daytime fatigue, pain, heart rate or blood pressure. These measures are important for determining effects beyond the reduction of insomnia symptoms. Insomnia is associated with considerable daytime dysfunction and an effective treatment should improve both sleep and daytime functioning. No trial reported a deterioration of a primary outcome or other adverse events. Even though adverse events were not among the primary outcomes of the individual trials, it is considered unethical not to report such events. Therefore, the absence of these reports may support the safety of the intervention. However, since it is not reported that no adverse events occurred, we cannot be sure if adverse events did occur, and authors just neglected to report them.

Population
The trials were heterogeneous with regard to participant characteristics. Most trials did not describe the sleep problems of the participants in sufficient detail. Few studies reported information the nature or duration of the sleep difficulties. All participants experienced insomnia as defined in this review as dissatisfaction with the quality, duration or continuity of sleep. However, the studies used different wording to describe the condition (insomnia, poor sleep, sleep problems), and most trials relied on the PSQI for the identification of sleep problems. The PSQI is a well-validated tool to measure sleep problems, with a clear cut-off score distinguishing good and poor sleepers. However, it is not a specific screening tool for insomnia and the exact nature of the sleep problems are not revealed by the global PSQI score. Therefore, it is unclear if the participants experienced difficulties initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, non-restorative sleep or any combination of these. Furthermore, the amount of daytime dysfunction resulting from the insomnia was not described. It could be argued that other tools, such as the ISI, would make a better screening tool for insomnia. Two studies included participants with a clinical diagnosis of insomnia disorder, but they were quite heterogeneous and more studies are needed to determine the effect of listening to music for insomnia disorder. Furthermore, very few of the included trials reported screening for other sleep disorders, and it cannot be excluded that some of the sleep complaints of the participants were due to other sleep disorders such as sleep apnoea or restless legs syndrome. Some trials gave no information on the underlying cause of insomnia; others related insomnia to a wide range of different conditions, such as pregnancy, chronic medical conditions or old age. The subgroup analyses found no difference in the effect on sleep quality based on condition and it seems that the effect of the music intervention was consistent across these diverse populations. However, the results show no evidence for an effect on sleep interruption and this suggests that music is less efficient for sleep maintenance problems although this hypothesis remains to be tested. As mentioned in the Description of the condition, insomnia symptoms are associated with a number of disorders and may be seen as a precursor to depression, as a factor affecting the long-term outcomes in neurological diseases, or a factor contributing to risk of falling in the elderly population. Therefore, early and safe interventions may be of great importance to both healthy and diseased populations.

Intervention
All trials used prerecorded music for the intervention, which reflects the common use of listening to music in many clinical and at-home settings. We were interested in the effect of music interventions that could easily be used by the general population or in clinical settings, and, therefore, we did not include studies using live music interventions. Most of the included trials used researcher-selected music without any clear rationale for the choice of the music. Some trials provided information on the specific characteristics of the music, and these features (e.g. slow tempo and low rhythmic accentuation) fit well with the literature describing the characteristics of potentially sedative music. Such detailed description of the music should be obligatory when reporting these types of trials since they can help clinicians make well-informed music selections. At the same time, we also know that musical taste varies widely among individuals and preferences as well as familiarity with the music may influence the efficacy of the intervention. In five trials, participants could choose among researcher-selected playlists of different genres or select tracks from a researcher-provided music database. To some degree this approach takes individual preferences into account and may enhance the participants' sense of control, which can be an important factor, especially in institutional or hospital settings where people can feel disempowered. When exploring the impact of giving participants a choice among preselected music versus the use of researcher-selected music, we found no difference in the effect on sleep quality. However, there was a limited number of studies giving the participants a choice, and no studies used fully participant-selected music. Some trials added relaxation instructions to the music listening intervention, but subgroup analyses showed no evidence of a difference in effect between trials with and without relaxation instructions. The music interventions used in these types of trials were called several names, including Cochrane Trusted evidence.

music listening, music intervention, music therapy or music. A common distinction is made between music medicine and music therapy, with music therapy involving an active therapeutic process between the patient and therapist, including the use of music. This is not the case in any of the included trials, and the interventions in this review fall within the music medicine domain.

## Duration and setting

Based on this review, listening to music daily for 14 to 90 days results in improved subjective sleep quality. The trials using only three or four days of intervention found no evidence of an effect of music on objective measures of SOL, total sleep time, sleep interruption or sleep efficiency. However, it is unclear if this lack of effect is related to the duration of the intervention or the use of objective measures of sleep. The subgroup analysis exploring the impact of the duration of the intervention found no effect, despite the fact that this has previously been suggested. The relationship between the duration of the intervention and the effect of the intervention remains unclear, and more research is needed to establish optimal duration of music interventions for adults with insomnia. The included trials used daily for about 45 minutes. This frequency and dosage of the intervention seems beneficial, given the reported effects on sleep quality. However, we cannot conclude if changes in these parameters would affect the effect of the intervention. Similarly, there was limited information on the significance of the timing of the intervention, even though most trials reported the use of music at bedtime. One included study had an active control group comparing daytime music listening to the use of music at bedtime. These results suggest a larger effect in the group listening to music at bedtime, but it remains to be tested in more studies. Most trials administered the intervention by participants in their own homes. This indicates that music listening can be effective as a self-administered intervention. However, it is important to note that these trials often included weekly contact from researchers to ensure compliance. This may be particularly important with elderly populations or populations with comorbid disorders.

## Quality of the evidence

All included trials were at high risk of bias on at least one of the rated items; consequently, the results of this review need to be interpreted with caution. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of the participants was not possible, and not all trials reported blinding of outcome assessors. This may result in overestimation of the treatment effects, especially since most trials used a self-report questionnaire to assess the main outcome of sleep quality. A placebo effect cannot be excluded. It will be important to have more studies with objective outcome measures of sleep since these are less sensitive to the placebo effect than subjective measures. Furthermore, the results are limited by the small sample sizes in many of the studies, resulting in a relatively small number of participants included in this review. Sensitivity analyses revealed no impact of inadequate randomisation, allocation concealment or blinding of outcome assessors on the results. The positive effect on sleep quality was consistent across all trials, with narrow CIs in most trials. For some trials, we received additional methodological and statistical information from the principal investigators, which improved the quality of the review. When summarising the assessment of risk of bias of individual studies, the results of the sensitivity analyses, and taking into account GRADE judgements of the overall certainty of the evidence, there is moderate-certainty evidence that, compared to no treatment or TAU, listening to music likely results in a large increase in sleep quality; and low-certainty evidence that it may improve sleep-onset latency, total sleep time and sleep efficiency. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of listening to music on insomnia severity and sleep interruption.

## Potential biases in the review process

We conducted extensive electronic searches and handsearches, and we contacted first authors and relevant experts for information on unpublished trials. Therefore, it seems unlikely that we missed important trials within this field. However, one can never be completely sure that all trials have been identified. Since there are still relatively few studies in this field, it may be that future studies can change the estimates of the effect. For example, the search identified eight ongoing studies, but the results were not yet published and could not be included. In this update, we decided to include only RCTs. The intention was to improve the certainty of the evidence now that more RCT were available. However, this decision also led to a number of quasi-randomised studies to be excluded, and we cannot rule out the possibility that they contain relevant information.

## Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

We identified five other systematic reviews on the efficacy of music listening for improvement of sleep quality in adults with sleep problems. These reviews had different inclusion and exclusion criteria and, therefore, included a different set of trials. The major difference was the population under review and the definition of the music intervention. Compared to other reviews, our inclusion criteria were stricter with regard to population, intervention and study design. We included only studies that documented the sleep problems of the participants at baseline. Furthermore, we focused on listening to prerecorded music and included only RCTs in this update. De Niet 2009 included five trials (308 participants). They only included trials in which the participants were adults with sleep complaints; however, it seems that they did not apply this inclusion criteria strictly, since they included one trial in which only some participants had poor sleep, and one trial with no clear documentation of the participants' sleep problems. They conducted a meta-analysis on sleep quality showing a beneficial effect similar to our results.

Wang 2014 focused on acute and chronic sleep disorder, and they did not require documentation of the sleep problems at baseline, resulting in a broader range of included trials. They included 10 trials (557 participants) that also included sleep problems related to hospitalisation. Their main outcome was sleep quality, and they reported a positive effect of the intervention, and these results are similar to our meta-analysis of the sleep quality outcome, but the effect size is slightly smaller. Feng 2018 conducted a network meta-analysis, including both randomised and non-randomised trials with combined interventions involving music, exercise, acupuncture, stimulus control and relaxation instructions. The study claimed to focus on adults with primary insomnia, but several of the studies included populations with no diagnosis of primary insomnia. The review included 20 studies (1339 participants), and they reported a meta-analysis on the effect of listening to music compared with usual care on sleep quality measured using the PSQI (SMD −0.61, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.20; 10 studies; 541 participants). These results are in line with our analysis, even though the population under study may be slightly different.

Recently, two reviews have been published, focusing on the effect of music for sleep improvement in older adults. Petrovsky 2021 included both randomised and non-randomised trials (16 studies, 812 participants). The studies included adults aged 50 years or older, and 11 studies used music listening interventions and five used combined interventions including music. Some studies had no control group and others compared music listening to active interventions such as walking exercise, meditation or progressive muscle relaxation. The review did not conduct a meta-analysis due to high clinical and methodological heterogeneity, but in their narrative found mixed evidence regarding an effect on sleep quality and other sleep parameters measured subjectively or objectively. These results differ from our results where we found evidence of a beneficial effect on sleep quality. However, we also found mixed evidence for an effect on other sleep outcomes, similar to Petrovsky 2021. Chen 2021 focused on music for sleep improvement in adults aged 60 years or older and only included RCTs. They included five studies (288 participants) that included both music listening interventions and active music making. The meta-analysis showed a beneficial effect of the music interventions on sleep quality measured using the PSQI (MD −1.96, 95% CI −3.23 to −0.69). In a subgroup analysis, they found that sedative music was more beneficial than rhythm-centred music. Another subgroup analysis suggested that using the music listening intervention for four weeks or longer was more efficient than shorter intervention periods. In our review, we did not find this effect of a longer intervention period, and future studies should clarify the impact of the duration of the intervention. Overall, the present review adds to the robustness of the findings by following rigorous methodology, including an extensive search strategy, clear inclusion criteria, and careful assessment and reporting of risk of bias.

Implications for practice
The findings of the meta-analysis suggest that listening to music may have a moderate to large beneficial effect on sleep quality in different populations experiencing insomnia symptoms. Limited conclusions can be drawn on the effect of music listening on other aspects of sleep or on related physiological and psychological aspects of daytime function, since few trials reported these outcomes. With the available evidence, this review provides no evidence of an effect of the music intervention on objective measures of sleep-onset latency, total sleep time, sleep interruption and sleep efficiency. However, subjective measures of these outcomes suggest that participants may experience improvements in sleep-onset latency, total sleep time and sleep efficiency with the music intervention with broad confidence intervals ranging from small to large effect sizes. We found no evidence of an effect on experienced sleep interruption. Since the studies report limited information on the nature of participants' sleep problems, it is not possible to draw any conclusions with regard to the effect on insomnia subtypes such as difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance or non-restorative sleep. Two studies diagnosed the participants with insomnia, and they both showed improved sleep quality with the music intervention, but no change in insomnia severity.

All included trials used music that was characterised as sedative or relaxing. However, these included a number of different musical styles (e.g. classical, new age, jazz, etc.), and at this point, it is not clear if some types of music may be more effective than others. In the literature, it is often recommended that participants are allowed to choose their own preferred music. In this review, there was no difference in the effect on sleep quality between trials using researcher-selected music and trials giving the participants a choice among a number of preselected types of music. Very few participants were offered the possibility to bring their own preferred music, and the effect of purely participant-selected music could not be investigated.

Implications for research
More high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of music listening for treating insomnia. The quality of the studies has improved from the 2015 review to this 2021 update, but blinding of researchers and outcome assessors should still be prioritised to minimise performance and detection biases.

Future research should consider a wider range of outcomes. In particular, more research should include objective measures of sleep, such as polysomnography and actigraphy, that are less sensitive to detection bias. The use of objective measures of sleep would reduce the impact of any placebo effect. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge of the effect of listening to music on daytime consequences and waking correlates of insomnia. It is important to know if the reported changes in sleep patterns or sleep quality are sufficient to affect daytime function. Furthermore, longer follow-up periods are important to genuinely establish the effectiveness of music and its long-term effect.

More research is needed to establish the effect of the intervention on different insomnia subgroups. Insomnia is a highly heterogeneous condition with different aetiology and severity. Future trials should take care to define and appropriately measure sleep disturbances and provide detailed information on the cause, duration and severity of symptoms, as well as any comorbid conditions. Participants should be screened for other sleep disorders to clarify the nature of the sleep complaint. It is also recommended that researchers employ well-defined criteria for insomnia such as the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or ICSD. This would improve the precision of the clinical diagnosis and hence improve comparability across trials. The music therapy literature recommends that music used for sedative purposes should be characterised by a slow tempo and an absence of abrupt changes and rhythmic complexity. These recommendations are supported by experimental research in the field of music psychology. controlled clinical trials are needed to examine which aspects of music are important to achieve an improvement in sleep. In addition, the relationship between the objective characteristics of the music and the subjective preferences of the individual remain unclear, and more trials are needed to investigate potential differences in effect between music selected by the researcher and that selected by the participant. Another aspect of the intervention that remains unclear is the optimal frequency, timing and duration of the intervention. Further research into these domains is important for assessing the effectiveness of the intervention and for providing the best treatment options for people with insomnia.

Risk of bias

Bias                                    Authors' judgement              Support for judgement

Random sequence genera-                 Low risk                        Quote: "Participants were randomly assigned …, using the drawing of lots"

Allocation concealment                  Low risk                        Quote: "All lots (labels) are packed in a jar that was prepared by another person. Researchers therefore did not know beforehand which group each participant would be assigned to"

Blinding of participants                High risk                       Comment: due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of participants was not possible. It is unclear if this affected the objective sleep measures, but likely that it affected the subjective measures of sleep. Blinding of personnel at the sleep laboratory was not reported. Since the intervention was music, it is likely that they were not blinded.

Blinding of outcome as-                 Low risk                        Comment: the technician scoring the PSG and the researchers doing the statistical analyses were not aware of which group the data belonged to.

| Other bias                             | High risk           | Comment: the trial design involved a difference between the intervention and control groups. The intervention group registered sleep quality once a week, whereas the control group only registered sleep quality before and after the intervention period. In addition, the intervention group, but not the control group, was contacted weekly by telephone to assess compliance with the protocol. |

Listening to music for insomnia in adults (Review)
Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. # Appendix 2. Criteria for assigning risk of bias judgements

1. **Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)**
We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence for each included trial in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it produced comparable groups. We rated the risk of bias as follows.

1. Low risk of bias: adequate method of random sequence generation (e.g. any truly random process such as random number table; computer random number generator). Block randomisation was considered low risk of bias if block size varied randomly.
2. High risk of bias: inadequate method of random sequence generation (e.g. any non-random process such as odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information about the method of random sequence generation to permit a judgement of low risk or high risk of bias.

2. **Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)**
We assessed the method used to conceal the allocation sequence for each included trial and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment, or changed after assignment. We rated the risk of bias as follows.

1. Low risk of bias: adequate method of allocation concealment (e.g. telephone or central randomisation); consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes.
2. High risk of bias: inadequate method of allocation concealment (e.g. open random allocation); unsealed or non-opaque envelopes; alternation; date of birth.
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to permit a judgement of low risk or high risk of bias.

3. **Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)**
We assessed the different methods used to blind personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received for each included trial. Since it is not possible to blind a participant to the treatment (music), we assessed trials at low risk of bias if we judged that the lack of blinding was not affecting the results. We assessed blinding of participants and personnel separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes, since we expected certain outcomes (e.g. laboratory measurements and physiological data such as heart rate or blood pressure) to be unaffected by blinding of participants and personnel. We rated the risk of bias as follows.

1. Low risk of bias: adequate method of blinding; outcome unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding.
2. High risk of bias: inadequate method of blinding; outcome likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to permit a judgement of low risk or high risk of bias.

4. **Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)**
We assessed the methods used to blind outcome assessment for each included trial. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes, as stated above. We rated the risk of bias as follows.

1. Low risk of bias: adequate method of blinding; outcome unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding.
2. High risk of bias: inadequate method of blinding; outcome likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to permit a judgement of low risk or high risk of bias. 5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)
We assessed data on attrition, exclusions and reasons to determine if they introduced bias. We described the completeness of data for each included trial and for each outcome or class of outcomes. We assessed whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers of participants included at each stage of the analysis (compared with the total participants randomised), whether reasons for attrition or exclusion were reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were likely to be related to outcomes. We judged whether incomplete data were dealt with adequately and rated the risk of bias as follows.

1. Low risk of bias: no missing outcome data; balanced missing outcome data; appropriate methods of imputing missing data.
2. High risk of bias: missing outcome data; unbalanced missing outcome data; inappropriate methods of imputing missing data.
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to permit a judgement of low risk or high risk of bias.

6. Selective reporting bias
We investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias for each included trial. We conducted electronic searches to identify protocols of respective trials as a source to judge selective reporting. We rated the risk of bias as follows.

1. Low risk of bias: all prespecified and expected outcomes were reported.
2. High risk of bias: not all prespecified and expected outcomes were reported; outcome that was not prespecified was reported; outcome was reported incompletely.
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to permit a judgement of low risk or high risk of bias.

7. Other bias
We assessed other risks of bias, specifically a risk of bias from baseline differences and a risk of bias from carry-over or period effects for cross-over trials. We rated the risk of bias as follows.

1. Low risk of bias: trial appeared free of other sources of bias.
2. High risk of bias: there was at least one high risk of bias.
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to permit a judgement of low risk or high risk of bias.

| Measures of treatment effect                | Dichotomous data: For dichotomous data, we would have presented the results as summary odd ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous data: The standardised mean difference (SMD) would have been used to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used different scales. All outcomes would have been presented with 95% CIs. If a trial had provided multiple interchangeable measures of the same construct at the same time point, we would have calculated the mean SMD across these outcomes and the mean of their estimated variances. Where trials had reported the same outcomes using continuous and dichotomous measures, we would have re-expressed ORs as SMDs, thereby allowing dichotomous and continuous data to be pooled together, as described in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2021). Ordinal data: Ordinal data measured on shorter scales would have been analysed as dichotomous data by combining categories, and the intervention effect would have been expressed using OR. |
| Unit of analysis issues                    | Cluster-randomised trials: We anticipated that trials using clustered randomisation would have controlled for clustering effects.

(Continued)

sible, we would have obtained external estimates of the ICC from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population, as described in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. When the ICC was established, we would have used it to reanalyse the trial data. If ICCs from other sources were used, we would have reported this and conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC.

### Cross-over trials

Cross-over trials would have been analysed using combined data from all study periods, or using first period data if combined data were not available.

### Trials with > 2 treatment arms

Had > 1 of the interventions been a music intervention, and there had been sufficient information in the trial to assess the similarity of the interventions, we would have combined similar music interventions to allow for a single pair-wise comparison.

### Dealing with missing data

We would have explored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data by performing sensitivity analyses based on consideration of best-case and worst-case scenarios. The potential impact of missing data on the findings of the review would have been addressed in the 'Discussion' section of the review.

### Assessment of heterogeneity

Had there been significant heterogeneity, we would have investigated it by conducting a subgroup analysis based on the participants' clinical characteristics and the interventions used in the included studies (see subsection on 'Subgroup analyses' below).

### Assessment of reporting bias

Had sufficient study data been available for individual outcomes, we would have drawn and inspected funnel plots for evidence of reporting or publication bias. We would have assessed funnel plot asymmetry visually and statistically using the Bee and Mazumdar and the Egger tests; 10 or more studies are recommended. Had asymmetry been suggested by visual assessment or detected in any of these tests, we would have performed exploratory analyses to investigate if it reflected publication bias or a true relationship between trial size and effect size.

### Subgroup analyses

We would have conducted the following subgroup analyses.

1. Duration and dosage of the intervention (dosage as 15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes of listening time; and duration as number of days of intervention: short, 1–4 days; medium, 5–20 days; and long, ≥ 21 days).
2. Aetiology of insomnia (e.g. psychological disorders, medical conditions or age-related sleep problems).
3. Subjective versus objective measure of sleep quality.

### Sensitivity analysis

We would have conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding trials using inadequate methods of blinding personnel.

Differences between Protocol and Review
========================================

Differences between protocol and review
We made the following three adjustments to the protocol.

1. We edited the title and the background section on 'Description of the condition' based on the comments of the peer-reviewers.
2. We added a section to the methods describing the assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach, as per Cochrane requirements.
3. We specified and ensured that trials involving any of the review authors were assessed by two other review authors with no involvement in the trial to reduce the potential for bias.

Differences between original review and update
1. We edited the title and the background section on 'Description of the condition' based on the comments of the peer reviewers and the scientific progress in the field.
2. For the 2021 update, more studies were available, and therefore, we included only randomised controlled trials and not quasi-randomised controlled trials.
3. We included 'Insomnia severity' as a primary outcome, to ensure an outcome evaluating the perceived severity of insomnia symptoms in addition to the more general sleep outcomes. This is important since the insomnia criteria relate to a subjective complaint of poor sleep.
4. We revised the search strategies by adding some additional free-text terms, and updated the old MeSH term Sleep disorders with the updated term Sleep Wake Disorders.
5. We added two daily updated segments of MEDLINE (MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print and MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-indexed Citations, and a source of systematic reviews (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews).
6. We replaced the trials register Current Controlled Trials with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.
7. For the 2021 update, we did not handsearch journals, as the large majority of journals are now digitally available and indexed in the databases. Furthermore, the handsearch of journals did not yield any additional studies in the 2015 literature search.
8. We conducted meta-analyses of studies that were homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions and outcomes despite substantial statistical heterogeneity. Where there was substantial heterogeneity, we explored methodological, clinical and statistical factors underlying the heterogeneity.
