Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in hospitalized children (Review) # Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in hospitalized children

## A B S T R A C T

### Background
Healthy sleep is an important component of childhood development. Changes in sleep architecture, including sleep stage composition, quantity, and quality from infancy to adolescence are a reflection of neurologic maturation. Hospital admission for acute illness introduces modifiable risk factors for sleep disruption that may negatively affect active brain development during a period of illness and recovery. Thus, it is important to examine non-pharmacologic interventions for sleep promotion in the pediatric inpatient setting.

### Objectives
To evaluate the effect of non-pharmacological sleep promotion interventions in hospitalized children and adolescents on sleep quality and sleep duration, child or parent satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, delirium incidence, length of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality.

### Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, three other databases, and three trials registers to December 2021. We searched Google Scholar, and two websites, handsearched conference abstracts, and checked reference lists of included studies.

### Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs, including cross-over trials, investigating the effects of any non-pharmacological sleep promotion intervention on the sleep quality or sleep duration (or both) of children aged 1 month to 18 years in the pediatric inpatient setting (intensive care unit [ICU] or general ward setting).

### Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, evaluated risk of bias, extracted and synthesized data, and used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of evidence. The primary outcomes were changes in both objective and subjective validated measures of sleep in children; secondary outcomes were child and parent satisfaction, cost-effectiveness ratios, delirium incidence or delirium-free days at time of hospital discharge, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and mortality. ## Main results

We included 10 trials (528 participants; aged 3 to 22 years) in inpatient pediatric settings. Seven studies were conducted in the USA, two in Canada, and one in Brazil. Eight studies were funded by government, charity, or foundation grants. Two provided no information on funding.

Eight studies investigated behavioral interventions (massage, touch therapy, and bedtime stories); two investigated physical activity interventions. Duration and timing of interventions varied widely. All studies were at high risk of performance bias due to the nature of the intervention, as participants, parents, and staff could not be masked to group assignment.

We were unable to perform a quantitative synthesis due to substantial clinical heterogeneity.

### Behavioral interventions versus usual care

Five studies (145 participants) provided low-certainty evidence of no clear difference between multicomponent relaxation interventions and usual care on objective sleep measures. Overall, evidence from single studies found no clear differences in daytime or nighttime sleep measures (33 participants); any sleep parameter (48 participants); or daytime or nighttime sleep or nighttime arousals (20 participants). One study (34 participants) reported no effect of massage on nighttime sleep, sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO), or total sleep time (TST) in adolescents with cancer. Evidence from a cross-over study in 10 children with burns suggested touch therapy may increase TST (391 minutes, interquartile range [IQR] 251 to 467 versus 331 minutes, IQR 268 to 373; P = 0.02); SE (76, IQR 53 to 90 versus 66, IQR 55 to 78; P = 0.04); and the number of rapid eye movement (REM) periods (4.5, IQR 2 to 5 versus 3.5, IQR 2 to 4; P = 0.03); but not WASO, sleep latency (SL), total duration of REM, or per cent of slow wave sleep.

Four studies (232 participants) provided very low-certainty evidence on subjective measures of sleep. Evidence from single studies found that sleep efficiency may increase, and the percentage of nighttime wakefulness may decrease more over a five-day period following a massage than usual care (72 participants). One study (48 participants) reported an improvement in Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire scores after discharge in children who received a multicomponent relaxation intervention compared to usual care. In another study, mean sleep duration per sleep episode was longer (23 minutes versus 15 minutes), and time to fall asleep was shorter (22 minutes versus 27 minutes) following a bedtime story versus no story (18 participants); and children listening to a parent-recorded story had longer SL than when a parent was present (mean 57.5 versus 43.5 minutes); both groups reported longer SL than groups who had a stranger-recorded story, and those who had no story and absent parents (94 participants; P < 0.001).

In one study (34 participants), 87% (13/15) of participants felt they slept better following massage, with most parents (92%; 11/12) reporting they wanted their child to receive a massage again. Another study (20 participants) reported that parents thought the music, touch, and reading components of the intervention were acceptable, feasible, and had positive effects on their children (very low-certainty evidence).

### Physical activity interventions versus usual care

One study (29 participants) found that an enhanced physical activity intervention may result in little or no improvement in TST or SE compared to usual care (low-certainty evidence). Another study (139 participants), comparing play versus no play found inconsistent results on subjective measures of sleep across different ages (TST was 49% higher for the no play groups in 4- to 7-year olds, 10% higher in 7- to 11-year olds, and 22% higher in 11- to 14-year olds). This study also found inconsistent results between boys and girls (girls in the first two age groups in the play group slept more than the no play group).

No study evaluated child or parent satisfaction for behavioral interventions, or cost-effectiveness, delirium incidence or delirium-free days at hospital discharge, length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, or mortality for either behavioral or physical activity intervention.

## Authors' conclusions

The included studies were heterogeneous, so we could not quantitatively synthesize the results. Our narrative summary found inconsistent, low to very low-certainty evidence. Therefore, we are unable to determine how non-pharmacologic sleep promotion interventions affect sleep quality or sleep duration compared with usual care or other interventions.

The evidence base should be strengthened through design and conduct of randomized trials, which use validated and highly reliable sleep assessment tools, including objective measures, such as polysomnography and actigraphy.

## PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY

### Methods for promoting sleep in children and young people in hospital without using medicines (non-medicinal)

**Key messages**

We are uncertain how effective non-medicinal sleep promotion methods are for children and young people in hospital. Cochrane Trusted evidence.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Studies that use established, reliable research methods are needed to investigate non-medicinal sleep promotion in hospitalized children and young people, to identify methods that work.

Why is sleep important for children in hospital?

Sleep is an important part of healthy childhood development and helps to keep children healthy. Sleep patterns change throughout childhood, as children’s brains develop. When children are ill and stay in hospital, their sleep may be of poor quality, or disrupted by the constant noise and light, medical treatments, monitoring by nurses, stress, and pain.

While medicines can be used to try to improve sleep in hospitalized children, studies show they do not work particularly well, and can make the quality of sleep worse. Non-medicinal ways of promoting sleep can be used instead. These may include changes to the hospital environment, music, massage, or other methods.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out whether non-medicinal ways of trying to improve sleep work better than usual care or other methods in hospitalized children.

We wanted to look at how well these different methods worked on:

- the quality and quantity of sleep in the children;
- child and parent satisfaction;
- length of time for which breathing was supported by a ventilator (ventilator support);
- delirium;
- cost-effectiveness;
- length of hospital stay; and
- mortality.

We also wanted to find out if non-medicinal methods were associated with any unwanted effects.

What did we do?

We looked for studies that compared non-medicinal methods for improving sleep with usual care, or other methods in children in hospital.

We compared and summarized the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 10 trials from three countries, which involved 528 children and young people (aged from 4 to 22 years). Eight studies were funded by non-profit organizations or government sources.

All the children and young people were staying in hospital for more than 48 hours on regular wards, or in children’s intensive care units. The methods used to try to improve sleep included behavioral interventions (relaxation, including music, reading, and quiet time; touch therapy, and massage), and physical activity interventions.

There were many differences between studies in the participants, the methods used to measure the quantity and quality of sleep, and the way the results were analyzed. As a result, we could not combine the findings of trials that investigated similar methods; instead, we provided a descriptive summary.

Behavioral interventions

Studies that combined methods of relaxation found that these may make little or no difference on the amount or quality of sleep compared to usual care.

Touch therapy may improve total sleep time and sleep quality in children with burns. Massage and bedtime stories may also improve sleep. However, we have little confidence in these results, because of differences in the study populations and the measurement methods they used. Cochrane Trusted evidence.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Children and parents may be satisfied with both massage and multicomponent relaxation methods for improving sleep. However, we are not confident about this result, as the people in the studies knew which sleep-improving method they received, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about their results.

We did not identify any studies that reported length of ventilator support, delirium, cost-effectiveness, length of hospital stay, or mortality.

## Physical activity interventions

One study showed that using a stationary (exercise) bicycle to improve sleep may not improve total sleep time or quality of sleep compared to usual care. Another study investigated whether organized play improved sleep; it found inconsistent results for boys and girls, and for children in different age groups. No study evaluated child or parent satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, delirium, length of ventilator support, length of hospital stay, or mortality.

## What are the limitations of the evidence?

We did not identify any studies that reported the effects of complementary interventions, such as aromatherapy, acupressure, or acupuncture.

We did not identify any studies for any intervention that reported length of ventilator support, delirium, cost-effectiveness, length of hospital stay, or mortality.

We are not confident in any of these results; it is possible that these results would change if we had more evidence.

Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in hospitalized children (Review) # BACKGROUND

## Description of the condition
Sleep is a basic human need. The process of rest and restoration occurs during the natural suspension of consciousness that occurs during sleep. Sleep is not a passive process, but one that is characterized by dynamic physiological changes. While the function of sleep remains elusive, the physiological effects and consequences of altered sleep can impact multiple systems throughout the body.

It is well known that sleep needs are in a constant state of change as a child matures from the neonatal to adolescent period, reflecting brain maturation. During recovery from illness, children admitted to the hospital are exposed to a multitude of risk factors for sleep disruption, including noise, pain, anxiety, medications, interruptions for nursing care, and invasive medical interventions. Studies that used both objective and subjective assessment tools have demonstrated severe sleep disruption in hospitalized children. Sleep disruption occurs at a time when recovery and healing are the goal, potentially interferes with fundamental physiological processes, and can lead to increased energy release, impaired immunity, and delirium. In addition, sleep disturbances from infancy through adolescence are associated with changes in brain morphology, and worsened short- and long-term neurocognitive outcomes.

Although there are proven, inexpensive, and non-invasive modalities to promote sleep, such methods are rarely used for children in the hospital setting. A recent systematic review of the literature surrounding sleep in the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) found only nine, mostly observational, studies that investigated the quality of sleep in critically ill children. All the studies demonstrated significant sleep fragmentation and decreases in slow-wave sleep. Slow-wave sleep is the most restorative aspect of sleep, and an integral component of cognitive maturation during childhood and adolescence. In the hospital floor setting, sleep disturbance due to noise, pain, vital sign checks, and anxiety is associated with increased night awakenings and longer sleep latency (time to sleep onset). Among children recovering from major surgery, approximately 40% demonstrate no identifiable difference between nighttime and daytime activity levels, measured by actigraphy, suggesting significant circadian rhythm (sleep-wake cycle) disturbance. Sleep promotion is not a priority in hospital culture, despite increasing evidence in the literature that sleep loss and fragmentation in critically-ill adults increase the risk of delirium, which is an important risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality. A recent Cochrane Review summarized the available evidence for non-pharmacological interventions to promote sleep in critically ill adults admitted to the ICU. Another systematic review summarized evidence on the effectiveness of non-pharmacologic interventions for preterm infants in the neonatal ICU. However, the role of non-pharmacological interventions for children and adolescents in other pediatric inpatient settings has not been synthesized.

## Description of the intervention
Given the adverse effects of sedatives and analgesics on sleep physiology, the use of non-pharmacological interventions has been explored in hospitalized adults, primarily in the ICU environment, and infants in the neonatal ICU (NICU). These interventions can be categorized as: (1) environmental (noise and lighting modification; (2) behavioral (massage, music therapy, guided imagery); and (3) physical therapy interventions (mobility and exercise during the day to improve sleep at night). Possible environmental interventions include: earplugs, alarm modifications, headphones, white noise, or unit-based 'quiet hours', cycled lighting, and bright light therapy. Behavioral and complementary interventions that have been investigated in hospitalized adults include massage, aromatherapy, acupressure, and relaxation interventions, including music therapy and guided imagery. All of these modalities have potential applications for the pediatric population, with the addition of kangaroo care (method of holding an infant that involves skin-to-skin contact) in the NICU setting. Although potential pharmacological therapies, such as melatonin and atypical antipsychotic medications, are increasingly being used in the pediatric hospital setting with a goal of sleep promotion or delirium prevention (or both), the short- and long-term effects of these agents are not well studied in the developing brain. Therefore, a focus on non-invasive, low-risk interventions is needed to promote sleep in hospitalized children undergoing active neurocognitive development.

## How the intervention might work
There is a growing body of literature supporting the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in promoting sleep in hospitalized adults and neonates. Hospitalized children and adolescents also encounter disrupted sleep, and are just as likely to experience side effects with pharmacological interventions that promote sleep. Environmental, behavioral, and physical activity interventions that promote sleep in the home environment should Cochrane Trusted evidence.

have similar benefits when translated to the hospital environment, with augmented effects when used in combination. Environmental interventions, including noise reduction and lighting optimization, are safe and potentially effective strategies to promote healthy sleep in children. Sudden peaks in noise levels that occur frequently in the adult ICU increase arousals from sleep, demonstrated by polysomnography, the gold-standard test for sleep measurement. In the pediatric ICU (PICU), noise is a strong predictor of sleep state, with louder noises correlating to increased awakenings from sleep. Reducing the background level, as well as peak levels of noise, with noise reduction interventions decreases the likelihood of arousing a child from sleep in the hospital setting, improving sleep continuity and quality. Continuous exposure to artificial light can abolish the normal circadian rhythm and diminish the normal peak in melatonin secretion at night. Day-night cycling of light could help normalize the circadian rhythm of hospitalized children and decrease time to sleep onset.
Behavioral interventions, such as massage and touch therapy, provide modes of relaxation to decrease stress and anxiety that is common for hospitalized infants and children, with potential to decrease time to sleep onset and improve sleep continuity and quality. Physical activity interventions engage the hospitalized child in activities and exercise during the day to promote rest at night.

Finally, complementary and alternative therapies, such as aromatherapy or acupuncture, may help decrease anxiety and improve pain, with improved time to sleep onset, sleep quality, and sleep continuity. Most importantly, all these interventions must be easy for caregivers to implement, and ideally, should have high compliance amongst children and adolescents to optimize efficacy, and effectively change the culture for sleep promotion.

Why it is important to do this review

Despite evidence that sleep disruption in hospitalized adults has a negative impact on outcomes, and inexpensive sleep promotion interventions can decrease morbidity for both adults and neonates, there is a lack of awareness in the pediatric community about modifiable risk factors for sleep disruption in hospitalized children and adolescents outside of the NICU environment. There is a critical need for a synthesis of the current evidence in children older than one month, to understand the potential benefits of specific sleep promotion interventions in a population undergoing active neurocognitive development. There are several risk factors for sleep fragmentation in acutely ill children, and several medications used to improve sleep (i.e. benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine) that may, in fact, have a negative effect on sleep quality. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effect of non-pharmacologic interventions to promote sleep in this vulnerable population.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies
In order to ensure recommendations based on highest level evidence, we only included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), randomized cross-over trials, and quasi-RCTs (participant allocation not strictly random, i.e. date of birth or alternation).

Types of participants
Infants, children, and adolescents aged between 1 month and 18 years, admitted to the hospital for more than 48 hours. Infants and children could have been in for surgical or medical reasons, or needed mechanical ventilation. We also considered studies with participants both above and below the age of 18 years, if they were in an inpatient pediatric hospital setting, and the study also included children and adolescents between 1 month and 18 years. We excluded studies that focused on infants < 1 month of age (44 weeks' postmenstrual age), or studies with infants > 1 month who had never left the hospital after birth, due to differences in sleep architecture in newborns, and in particular preterm infants. We also excluded studies focused solely on children with central or obstructive sleep apnea, because non-pharmacologic interventions are unlikely to impact the physiologic and anatomic aspects of these conditions.

Types of interventions
We included studies investigating the effects of any of the following non-pharmacological sleep promotion interventions on the sleep quality or sleep duration (or both) of children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years, in the pediatric inpatient setting.

1. Environmental interventions, including, but not limited to: earplugs, headphones, alarm modifications, white noise, or unit-based 'quiet hours', lighting control or cycling, eye masks, and bright light therapy, or a combination
2. Behavioral Interventions, including, but not limited to: massage, music therapy, guided imagery, and kangaroo care (skin-to-skin contact)
3. Physical activity interventions, such as mobility or exercise during the day
4. Complementary and alternative therapies, such as aromatherapy and acupressure or acupuncture
5. Any other non-pharmacological intervention intended to promote the sleep of children in the hospital

Studies could include one intervention, or a combination of interventions in a treatment arm, and compare them to usual care or an alternative intervention. Cochrane Trusted evidence.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes
1. Changes in objective and validated measures of sleep, assessed using a polysomnography or actigraphy (or both); specifically, total sleep time (TST, based on age-based normative data), percentage rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, minutes of wake, percentage of slow-wave sleep, sleep efficiency, and Sleep Fragmentation Index (SFI), during the period of the intervention
2. Subjective measures of sleep, as measured by:
a. parent and nurse surveys; and
b. subjective, validated sleep assessment tools, such as the Patient Sleep Behavior Observation Tool, or the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire

We excluded studies if they did not report any outcomes relevant to sleep (objective or subjective measures, outlined above), given the focus of the review and the fact that interventions, like physical activity, massage, etc. are used for a multitude of purposes.

Secondary outcomes
1. Participant or parent satisfaction, as described by the study authors
2. Cost-effectiveness ratios
3. Delirium incidence or delirium-free days at time of hospital discharge
4. Length of mechanical ventilation (days)
5. Length of hospital stay (days)
6. Mortality

Data collection and analysis
We only reported the methods used for this review. For methods that will be used in future updates of this review, please see Kudchadkar 2017 and Appendix 2.

Selection of studies
After merging the results of the above literature search strategy in Endnote, we removed duplicates and exported titles and abstracts into Excel. We randomly assigned each study a number, and rearranged them into numeric order. Two pairs of review authors screened an equal number of reports. The two review authors in each pair independently reviewed the titles and abstracts based on the inclusion criteria, defined under Criteria for considering studies for this review. Each review author classified abstracts as yes – include, or no – exclude. Each pair of review authors reviewed and discussed disagreements to reach consensus. If there was disagreement after discussion, they included the study for full-text review. If there was any doubt of eligibility, we obtained the full text of the paper for review. The same pair of authors reviewed the full texts of the 'include' group of titles and abstracts. discussed disagreements until a consensus was reached. A study was excluded from data extraction if both review authors agreed it should be excluded after they reviewed the full text. The final list of studies chosen by both pairs of review authors for data extraction were merged again and renumbered for random assignment to two independent review authors, as detailed in Data extraction and management. Results of the selection process are presented in Figure 1.

## Data extraction and management

Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form in Covidence, developed collectively by the review authors. One review author entered data onto the form and the other member of the pair re-entered the data using a double-data strategy. All disagreements were resolved by group consensus and third party consultation, as needed. We extracted the following data.

1. Study characteristics
a. country of study
b. year of study
c. study design
d. method of randomization (if applicable)
e. unit of analysis
f. setting (inpatient general floor, subspecialty floor [i.e. oncology, surgery, etc.], PICU, or NICU)
g. outcome measures
h. conflict of interest and declaration of conflict of interest

2. Participant characteristics
a. age
b. sex
c. race
d. inclusion/exclusion criteria
e. comorbidity (prematurity, developmental delay, traumatic brain injury, surgery)
f. admission diagnosis
g. hospital length of stay

3. Intervention
a. type of intervention (earplugs, earmuffs, headphones, music therapy, white noise, unit-based 'quiet-time' protocol, alarm modifications, etc.)
b. timing of intervention
c. duration of intervention
d. frequency of intervention
e. any other associated interventions (i.e. sleep promotion 'bundles' using multiple interventions to promote sleep)

## Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for sources of systematic bias. We assessed studies using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For each included study, we classified risk of bias as low, high, or unclear for each of the following domains: random sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), and other potential sources of bias (other bias).

## Assessment of heterogeneity

By assessing variations in participant, intervention, and outcome characteristics, we examined clinical as well as methodological heterogeneity. These included the following.

1. Participant characteristics: age, sex, comorbidities, inclusion/exclusion criteria

2. Intervention characteristics: type of intervention, timing, duration
We provided a narrative description of important, clinically-relevant findings.

3. Outcome characteristics: method of measurement, timing
When clinical heterogeneity was too great, we planned to provide a narrative summary.

Assessment of reporting biases
We sought both published and unpublished literature to address publication bias. However, there were not enough studies to create a funnel plot to investigate reporting bias.

Data synthesis
We did not perform a meta-analysis due to substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity (see Assessment of heterogeneity). Instead, we undertook a narrative synthesis of included studies, presenting information in relevant tables (study characteristics and results, including comparisons between interventions, i.e. behavioral interventions versus usual care, physical activity interventions versus usual care). We also presented a comprehensive discussion of each study’s methodology or risk of bias (or both) that may have affected the quantitative result obtained. We reported the results without meta-analysis, using the 2020 Synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) in systematic reviews reporting guideline. We used the SWiM reporting guideline to ensure transparent reporting of our narrative synthesis, including how we grouped studies, metrics, and methods used for synthesis, data presentation, and presentation of limitations.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned to conduct subgroup analyses, using the statistical test for planned subgroup differences, however, we had too few trials, small sample sizes, and insufficient data available to do so. See Appendix 2 for subgroup details.

Sensitivity analysis
We planned to conduct sensitivity analyses. However, the number of trials, sample sizes, and data available were insufficient to do so. See Appendix 2 for details.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence
We summarized the results of each comparison (behavioral interventions versus usual care; physical activity interventions versus usual care), for the primary outcomes (objective and subjective measures of sleep), and the secondary outcomes (participant or parent satisfaction) in Summary of findings 1 and Summary of findings 2. We created the tables using GRADEpro GDT and Review Manager 5 software. Using the GRADE approach, two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low, according to the presence of the following criteria:
- limitations in design and implementation;
- indirectness of evidence;
- unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistent results;
- imprecision of results; and
- high risk of publication bias.

Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in hospitalized children (Review)

Included studies
We included 10 studies in this review. One study was only available as a conference abstract. The included studies were published between 1983 and 2019.

Study types
Eight of the included studies were parallel trials, randomized (RCT) at the individual level. One study was a cross-over trial, and one was a cluster-randomized trial.

Participants and settings
In total, there were 528 participants in the included studies. Sample sizes ranged from 6 to 139. Seven studies were conducted in the United States, two in Canada, and one in Brazil. The hospital setting varied between studies, and included an inpatient burn unit, inpatient psychiatric unit, inpatient oncology unit, inpatient general pediatric unit, and a pediatric ICU. These settings reflected the populations of focus: children and adolescents with burns; with psychiatric disorders; those who were critically ill; those who were on oncology units, including those with central nervous system tumors; on general pediatric units; and those admitted for surgery. Given the mix of included inpatient settings, the age of participants across studies ranged from 4 years to 22 years. Studies including participants 18 years and over, and children under 18; all were conducted in a pediatric inpatient setting.

Interventions
The most commonly studied category of non-pharmacologic intervention was behavioral interventions. Cochrane Trusted evidence.
Informed decisions.
Better health.

Two studies investigated physical activity interventions. No studies reported a focused environmental intervention, however, the multicomponent relaxation interventions did incorporate elements that included quiet time at night. There were no studies of complementary therapies, including acupuncture or acupressure. The non-pharmacologic sleep promotion interventions investigated in the included studies were heterogenous in the methods, timing, frequency, duration, and components; and ranged from short, one-time interventions (touch therapy) to the entire hospital admission. The cross-over trial had no specified washout period between intervention periods.

1. Behavioral interventions
Multicomponent relaxation intervention

Three studies used a combination of behavioral approaches to develop a multicomponent relaxation intervention.

Papaconstantinou examined the effect of a Relax to Sleep intervention on sleep in general pediatric, surgery, or cardiology units. The Relax to Sleep intervention is comprised of one-on-one education for parents, with information about sleep, age, and developmentally appropriate instructions to train children in the use of diaphragmatic breathing exercises. Younger children were given a storybook to facilitate breathing exercises, and older children, a music file with a relaxation script; the exercises were practiced with the researcher. Guidance for parents included the importance of exposing their child to bright light each day.

Rennick investigated the effect of a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) soothing intervention, consisting of parental comforting (touch and reading), followed by a quiet period of music. A fleece headband was also offered to deliver soft music, or just reduce external noise after the reading session, for up to one hour. The intervention continued throughout the PICU and hospital ward stay.

In Rogers, the multicomponent intervention aimed at relaxation included age-appropriate sleep education and relaxation training on Day 0, followed by a parental-implemented relaxation technique (book, massage). Stimulus control measures included measures to decrease nighttime disrupters, including 90-minute protected periods for sleep with bundled care.

Massage
Two studies investigated the effect of massage on sleep outcomes.

In Field, massage was administered for 30 minutes a day, for a duration of 5 days.
Jacobs administered massage 20 to 30 minutes a day, for two to three nights, after a baseline phase of two nights.

Parent-recorded bedtime stories
Two studies investigated the effect of parent-recorded bedtime stories on sleep.

In White, parents recorded a 10-minute bedtime story, which was played for the children in the intervention group on nights two and three, after one night of baseline.

The interventions in White consisted of (1) parent-recorded story with parent absent; (2) stranger-recorded story with parent absent; (3) no story and parent absent; (4) no story and parent present (convenience sample). Stories were only played on night two. For both studies, parents had the option to add individualized comments, or modify the story as they deemed fit.

Touch therapies
One cross-over study examined the use of healing touch, which consisted of non-invasive and gentle use of the practitioner’s hands, either directly on the clothed body or slightly above the child's body. The touch therapy procedure was comprised of three techniques: (1) magnetic clearing (15 to 30 full length, smooth, continuous passes with both hands, one to six inches from the body); (2) mind clearing, with hands placed lightly on, or above, several sites around face, neck, and forehead; (3) chakra connection involved the practitioner placing their hands on the major and minor chakras of the body. Participants received both the touch therapy and usual care on successive nights; the order of intervention was randomized.

2. Physical activity interventions
Two studies investigated the effect of physical activity on sleep.

Enhanced Physical Activity
Hinds explored an enhanced physical activity intervention with a stationary bicycle-style exerciser, which was used for 30 minutes twice daily, for two to four days of hospitalization.

Play
In a conference abstract, Potasz reported the effect of play versus no play, where play included a visit to a toy library twice a day for one hour at a time, and taking toys back to the room, where trained professional facilitated activities.

Comparators
All studies compared the intervention to usual care (standard clinical care), with the exception of White, in which the control group was parent present, and no story.

Outcomes
Included studies investigated the effect of non-pharmacologic sleep promotion interventions on objective or subjective sleep outcomes, or both. None of the trials measured all outcomes relevant to this review.
Objective sleep assessment
One study used polysomnography to measure total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, % time in non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 1 (N1), N2, N3, rapid eye. Cochrane Trusted evidence.

movement (REM), and total minutes of N1, N2, N3, and REM.

Five studies used actigraphy. The actigraphic variables reported by these studies varied. Hinds reported 24-hour sleep efficiency and total sleep time; while Jacobs explored those metrics in addition to nighttime-specific total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and long sleep episode. In Papaconstantinou, sleep metrics were measured by daytime and nighttime periods (total sleep time, longest sleep period), in addition to nighttime awakenings, and wake after sleep onset. Parameters measured in Rennick included both daytime and nighttime sleep minutes, and nighttime arousals on the ward and at home; actigraphy was not used in the PICU due to concerns that sedatives and immobility might affect measures. Rogers reported daytime and nighttime percent sleep, mean duration of sleep episodes, longest sleep episode, mean duration of wake episodes, wake episodes, and longest wake episode.

Subjective sleep assessment
Five studies reported use of subjective sleep assessment. Field observed videos recorded during nighttime sleep, and coded them for active sleep versus awake, and lighting quietly, awake, and active. Papaconstantinou reported the effect of their intervention on the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, which was completed at baseline and five to seven days after hospital discharge. The conference abstract by Potasz reported use of sleep logs, without additional information about validation or reliability. Finally, two studies used the Sleep Onset Latency Behavior Catalog and Falling Asleep Behavioral Inventory, both of which comprised 54 different falling asleep behaviors to characterize participants' sleep behavior, for 45 minutes on each night of observation.

Participant/parent satisfaction
Two studies reported participant, or parental satisfaction, or both, with the non-pharmacologic intervention used. Jacobs used an end-of-study questionnaire, using Likert-scale responses on the perception of massage, and how the participant slept and felt after massage, along with open-ended questions. In Rennick, parental perception about the intervention was measured by research assistant observation, and recoding of child and parent responses.

Funding of studies
Eight studies were funded by grants; two provided no information on funding. No sources of corporate funding were reported.

Excluded studies
We excluded 518 reports following full-text review of 529 reports; we removed 17 because they were duplicates. We describe the reasons for excluding 21 studies in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. The most common reasons for excluding studies were observational study design (N = 8), and no relevant outcomes for this review (N = 5).

Risk of bias in included studies
We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. Please see the Characteristics of included studies tables for further details.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

### Allocation
low risk of bias, because they fully and completely reported all prespecified outcomes.
Out of 10 studies, we assessed seven at low risk of bias for random sequence generation. These studies all had clear descriptions of the randomization procedures. Two studies did not provide specifics on their randomization strategy and we classed them at unclear risk of bias. We assessed one study at high risk of bias, because only children whose parents agreed not to stay at the bedside were randomized; if parents wanted to be present, they were allocated to the 'parent present' group.

### Allocation concealment
We rated studies at low risk of bias for allocation concealment if there were sufficient details for randomization of the sequence. We assessed six studies at low risk of bias. Allocation concealment was unclear in two studies, due to insufficient information. We assessed one study at high risk of bias as allocation could be dependent on parental presence at the bedside.

### Blinding
We assessed all 10 included studies at high risk of performance bias because of the inability and challenge of blinding participants and personnel to the intervention in all cases.

### Detection bias
We assessed only two studies at low risk of bias for detection because the outcomes assessors were adequately blinded. These studies relied on objective methods of assessment that would not be affected by knowledge of the intervention assignment. We assessed three studies at unclear risk of bias, due to inadequate information. We assessed four studies at high risk of detection bias, because all of them used subjective assessment of sleep outcomes, and there was potential knowledge of the intervention assignment.

### Incomplete outcome data
We assessed five studies at low risk of attrition bias, because they reported no or minimal loss to follow-up after enrollment. There was insufficient information to make a determination of bias for three studies. We assessed two studies at high risk of bias.

### Selective reporting
We did not assess any studies at high risk of selective reporting bias. We assessed five studies at unclear risk of bias due to insufficient information in the text; and five studies at high risk of bias.

### Multicomponent relaxation intervention
Table 1 presents results for the three included studies with sufficient data that examined multicomponent relaxation interventions on an objective measure of sleep, using actigraphy. We did not synthesize these results because there were inconsistencies in the reporting of actigraphy metrics across studies, and small sample sizes, which did not allow us to translate medians to means with confidence.

Papaconstantinou 2018 found no clear difference in total nighttime sleep between the Relax to Sleep Intervention (mean difference 50 minutes, 95% confidence interval -7.19 to 106.5; 1 study; 48 participants) and usual care (mean total sleep duration 370 minutes); and no clear difference in the longest continuous nighttime sleep period (mean difference 16 minutes, 95% CI -19.33 to 50.62). They also suggested there may be a decrease in wake after sleep onset with the intervention (mean difference -45 minutes, 95% CI -112.8 to 22.15).

A second study, Rennick 2018, with 20 participants, suggested PICU soothing may slightly increase median sleep duration during daytime hours over usual care (300.62 minutes, IQR 163.9 to 365.7 versus 240 minutes, IQR 170 to 375). There may be no clear difference between PICU soothing and usual care on median sleep duration at night (510 minutes, IQR 434 to 550.8 versus 526 minutes, IQR 413.44 to 596.06).

(4) active and awake. Only 68% of tapes were available, due to noncompliance and technical issues. The findings suggested that massage may increase the per cent of time asleep over five days (MD 11.6 minutes; P = 0.01) more than the control group (MD 2.4; P = ns), and may decrease nighttime wakefulness (% time awake) over the same period (MD -11.2; P = 0.05) over usual care (MD 2.3). However we are very uncertain about the evidence.

Rogers 2019 (33 participants) suggested that there may be no clear difference across the study period for any daytime or nighttime sleep variables in children receiving the multicomponent intervention compared to controls, including percentage of sleep, number of sleep episodes, mean duration of sleep episodes, longest sleep episode, mean duration of wake episodes, number of wake episodes, or longest wake episodes. See Table 1 for breakdown of results.

Touch Therapy

One cross-over RCT with 10 participants investigated the effect of healing touch compared to usual care on sleep, using polysomnography (Table 2). The study authors reported that healing touch may be more effective than usual care for total sleep time (391 minutes, IQR 251 to 467 versus 331 minutes, IQR 268 to 373; P = 0.02). There could also be an increase in sleep efficiency with healing touch (76%, IQR 53 to 90 versus 66%, IQR 55 to 78; P = 0.04); more REM periods (4.5, IQR 2 to 5 versus 3.5, IQR 2 to 4; P = 0.03), and more N2 minutes (213 minutes, IQR 136 to 236 versus 160, IQR 107 to 204; P = 0.03). However, there may be no difference in sleep latency, number of awakenings, WASO, N3 minutes, or the proportion of time spent in each sleep stage (Cone 2014).

Massage

Table 3 presents the results of Jacobs 2016 (34 participants), which investigated the effect of massage compared to standard care on actigraph sleep parameters. There was insufficient information to report univariate statistics, and SDs or CIs, thus we presented the results of the mixed-effect model. The mixed-effect model showed that total sleep time (TST) may be similar for the massage group (391 minutes at baseline plus 53 minutes at end) compared to standard care (431 minutes at baseline minus 30 minutes at end), as was sleep efficiency.

2. Changes in subjective measures of sleep (parent/participant surveys and validated sleep assessment tools)

We rated the certainty of the evidence contributing to this outcome as very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the findings.

Multicomponent relaxation intervention

One study reported the effect of a multicomponent relaxation intervention (Relax to Sleep) compared to usual care on Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) scores, five to seven days after discharge from the hospital (Papaconstantinou 2018). The Relax to Sleep program may reduce scores on the CSHQ more than usual care (MD -3.2, 95% CI -6.21 to -0.19; P = 0.037; 1 study, 48 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain.

Massage
Bedtime stories

Two studies (112 participants) from the same author group observed and reported the effect of bedtime stories on sleep behaviors, with the Sleep Onset Behavior Catalog (White 1983; White 1990).

In White 1983, the authors compared parent-recorded bedtime story versus no bedtime story. They found that parent-recorded bedtime stories may lead to longer mean duration of sleep (measured on the third night) compared to usual care (23 minutes versus 15 minutes; 18 participants). Time to fall asleep might also be shorter following parent-recorded bedtime stories (22 minutes versus 27 minutes) versus no story. The authors neither reported the P values for these results nor stated if these differences between the groups were statistically significant.

White 1990 (94 participants) evaluated the effect of recorded bedtime stories on sleep latency in four groups, using the Sleep Onset Behavior Catalog: parent-recorded/parents absent versus stranger-recorded/parents absent; versus no story/parents absent; versus no story/parents present. Children listening to a parent-recorded story may have longer sleep latencies (mean 57.5 minutes) compared to when a parent is present (43.5 minutes); both groups had longer sleep latency than those who had the stranger-recorded story, and no story/parent absent (P < 0.001). However the evidence is very uncertain.

Secondary outcome

Participant or parent satisfaction, or both

The certainty of evidence for participant or parent satisfaction, or both, was rated as very low.

One study investigating the effects of massage versus usual care suggested that satisfaction may be increased in the massage group compared to usual care (Jacobs 2016; 34 participants). They reported that 87% (13/15) of participants felt they slept better, and most parents in the study (92%; 11/12) reported that they wanted their child to receive massage in the future.

Another study of multicomponent relaxation intervention versus usual care in children in pediatric ICU reported that parents thought the music, touch, and reading components of the intervention were acceptable and feasible, with positive effects on their children (Rennick 2018; 20 participants).

None of the studies of behavioral interventions evaluated cost-effectiveness, delirium incidence or delirium-free days at hospital discharge, length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, or mortality.

One study, Field 1992, reported the effect of massage versus usual care on sleep, using video observation (72 participants). Videos were coded for (1) quiet sleep (no body movements), (2) active sleep (body movement), (3) awake and lying quietly, and Cochrane Trusted evidence.

## Physical activity interventions versus usual care

### Primary outcome

**Changes in objective and validated measures of sleep (PSG or actigraphy)**
Enhanced physical activity

One study investigated enhanced physical activity compared to usual care. The results suggested that there may be no clear difference between the groups in either total sleep time or sleep efficiency, shown in Table 4. We rated the certainty of this evidence as low.

**Changes in subjective measures of sleep (parent/participant surveys and validated sleep assessment tools)**
Play activities

One study investigated play versus a no-play group to promote sleep, using sleep logs. For this study, we only have a conference abstract and as such, there is insufficient information to determine effect estimates between groups. The findings provided in the abstract suggest that there may be inconsistent findings across age groups and gender. The authors reported that TST in the no-play group was 49% higher in four- to seven-year-old boys, 9.5% higher in 7.1- to 11-year-old boys, and 22% higher in 11.1- to 14-year-old boys. However, girls from the two youngest age groups may have more sleep in the play group (4% higher for 4- to 7-year-old girls, and 14% higher for 7.1- to 11-year-old girls); girls in the oldest age group had 46.1% more sleep in the no-play group. Boys in the usual care group had more daytime sleep across all age groups (4 to 7 years: 26%; 7.1 to 11 years: 46%; 11.1 to 14 years: 36%), similar to girls in the oldest two age groups of the no-play group (7.1 to 11 years: 23%; 11.1 to 14 years: 59%). In contrast, the youngest girls had more sleep during the day in the play group (13%). We rated the certainty of this evidence as very low.

### Secondary outcomes

None of the studies of physical interventions evaluated participant or parent satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, delirium incidence or delirium-free days at hospital discharge, length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, or mortality.

## DISCUSSION

### Summary of main results

Our review sought to assess the effects of non-pharmacologic sleep promotion interventions for hospitalized children and adolescents. All included studies took place in inpatient pediatric settings, including a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU), and burn, oncology, general pediatric, surgical, cardiology, and psychiatric units. The types of interventions varied widely, including behavioral interventions, such as multicomponent relaxation interventions, massage, and touch therapy; and physical activity interventions, such as exercise bicycle and age-appropriate play. The timing, duration, and frequency varied across interventions, anywhere from one-time interventions to the entire duration of hospital admission.

We included 10 studies, with a total of 528 participants, who ranged in age from 3 years to 22 years. Compared with usual care or controls, behavioral and physical activity interventions showed inconsistent effects across objective and subjective metrics of sleep quality and quantity. A study of touch therapy found it may improve total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and number of REM periods, with low-certainty evidence. Other studies, including multicomponent relaxation interventions, bedtime stories, massage, physical activity, and play interventions demonstrated variable effects on sleep quality and duration, with low- or very low-certainty evidence.

### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

It is remarkable that none of the included studies enrolled children under three years of age, who have a high burden of hospitalization and are undergoing neurodevelopment most rapidly. For example, recent point prevalence studies in the USA, Canada, and Europe found that two-thirds of all children admitted to pediatric ICUs for more than 72 hours are under the age of three years. The majority of studies in this review evaluated the effect of non-pharmacologic sleep promotion interventions in school-age children and adolescents, identifying major knowledge gaps for a vulnerable infant and toddler inpatient population. Thus, the omission of children in younger age groups limits generalizability of the findings. Also, none of the studies specifically addressed children with functional impairments, for whom specific interventions may not be applicable (i.e. lighting interventions in blind children, noise interventions for deaf children, physical activity interventions for children with limited mobility). However, the included studies did represent a wide spectrum of pediatric inpatient settings, which is a strength of the evidence.

None of the studies focused on specific environmental interventions, such as noise reduction and lighting optimization, which may be more feasible and generalizable across settings than multicomponent interventions. None of the studies investigated important patient-centered outcomes, including delirium, duration of mechanical ventilation, cost, and mortality.

Finally, most of the included studies had a small number of participants, and the largest study was only retrievable as a conference abstract, limiting our ability to evaluate those data.

### Quality of the evidence

We used the GRADE process to judge the certainty of the evidence. We judged the evidence to be of low- and very low-certainty, due to limitations in study design (high risk of performance bias), low numbers of included trials, and small sample size limitations. There was variable reporting among trials for random sequence generation and concealment of allocation. Both objective and subjective assessments of sleep quality and quantity were affected by substantial variability in the types of outcomes measured. There were also substantial differences in populations and interventions, which decreased our certainty of the evidence for behavioral interventions. The 10 included studies largely focused on different populations, including children admitted to inpatient psychiatry; children with oncologic diagnoses, including central nervous system tumors; critically ill children; and children in general pediatric and surgical units, which may limit generalizability of the interventions across pediatric inpatients. Finally, all studies were single-center, which limits generalizability across different hospital settings. ## Potential biases in the review process

We are confident that this review comprehensively summarizes the currently available evidence from randomized controlled trials of non-pharmacologic sleep promotion interventions for pediatric inpatients. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full-text reports, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and GRADE levels. We followed up on all ongoing trials to delineate availability of results and publication. We did not exclude any potentially relevant trials, and took all measures to minimize the introduction of additional bias. However, there remains a possibility that we failed to identify relevant unpublished trials contributing positive or negative results, as well as studies not indexed in English language databases. There is also the potential of non-financial, unconscious bias, due to author interest in this research and clinical topic, as evidenced by previous publications relevant to the topic.

## Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

We did not identify other reviews by other authors for this research question. One systematic review focused on sleep in critically ill children. It was limited to the pediatric ICU setting and was broader in scope, including all descriptive studies, interventions, and outcomes relevant to sleep in the pediatric ICU. Another systematic review focused specifically on non-pharmacologic sleep promotion interventions in preterm infants in neonatal ICUs, a population that was specifically excluded in this review. None of the trials included in the current Cochrane Review were included in the previous systematic reviews.

## AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS

### Implications for practice

The randomized controlled trials included in this Cochrane Review provided insufficient information for review authors to determine the most effective non-pharmacologic interventions for sleep promotion in hospitalized children. The available evidence is limited, and of low- or very low-certainty; however, it provides a foundation for the development of rigorous studies in vulnerable patient populations. Importantly, a critically important age group and patient population, infants and toddlers admitted to any inpatient setting were not represented in any of the trials, since we did not consider infants in neonatal ICUs for this review. Furthermore, none of the trials evaluated important participant-centered outcomes, including delirium, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mortality.

### Implications for research

Future clinical trials investigating interventions for non-pharmacologic sleep promotion in the pediatric inpatient setting must prioritize the inclusion of hospitalized infants and young children (ward and ICU) in addition to other age groups, to enable analysis of efficacy according to age. A focus on these young patients will help identify best practices for sleep promotion in a vulnerable population undergoing rapid neurocognitive and physical development. While the study of multifaceted interventions is pragmatic, feasibility and sustainability of interventions is key. Thus, it would also be beneficial to investigate single interventions, such as noise reduction and lighting optimization versus usual care to determine the most effective combinations for multifaceted interventions. Future trials should also prioritize use of objective assessment tools and measures. Polysomnography and actigraphy should be considered the first line for sleep measurement, with consistent reporting of validated measures for both sleep quality and quantity. However, the challenges of using and interpreting actigraphy and polysomnography in acutely ill children must also be considered, with a focus on efficient methods for sleep measurement that do not interfere with care or a child's natural sleep pattern. Only validated subjective tools for sleep measurement should be used, when possible. Development of surveys to address gaps in infant and toddler sleep assessment is needed. Research must also evaluate the evolution and recovery of sleep patterns after transfer or discharge from the ICU. Finally, research focused on non-pharmacologic sleep promotion interventions should include core child-centered outcomes, such as delirium, duration of mechanical ventilation, cost, and mortality. While non-pharmacologic sleep promotion may seem like a common sense approach to care, rigorous interprofessional research is needed to affect culture change in the pediatric inpatient setting to prioritize sleep hygiene.

## Study characteristics

### Methods
Type of publication: manuscript

Study design: randomized controlled trial

Study grouping: parallel group

Country: USA

Funding: National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Scientist Award (MH00331), and NIMH research grant (MH40779)

Study period: not specified

Outcomes relevant to this review: validated subjective measures of sleep

Overall objective of study: to examine the independent effects of the massage component on the behaviors and physiology of children and adolescents who were hospitalized for depression or adjustment disorder

### Participants
Setting: inpatient psychiatric unit

Sample size: 72

Dropouts: not specified

Mean age: 13 years (range 7 to 18)

Sex: 40 boys, 32 girls

Inclusion criteria: hospitalized children and adolescents with a diagnosis of depression or adjustment disorder according to DSM-III-R criteria, assessed by a physician

Exclusion criteria: combination of conditions or complex medication timing schedule, or both

### Interventions
Intervention (N = 52; 26 = depressed, and 26 = adjustment disorder): the massage group received 30 minutes of back massage a day for 5 days, with pressure and smooth movements. The massage consisted of carefully timed stroking movement for 5-minute periods in each of the 3 regions: up and down the neck, from the neck across the shoulders to the back of the neck, and from the neck to the waist and back of the neck along the vertebral column. The 15-minute sequence was composed of 30 back and forth strokes per region at 10 seconds each. The same 15-minute sequence was repeated in its entirety for a 30-minute massage. The massages were given mid-afternoon.

Control group (N = 20; 10 = adjustment disorder, 10 = depression): The participant simply sat and watched a relaxing videotape (of pleasant sounds and visual images) with the student for 30 minutes. The participant was asked to remain still and quiet for the 30-minute session.

### Outcomes
Primary outcomes: anxiety, measured by State Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), Profile Of Mood States (POMS), and behavior observation ratings (7-item behavior rating scale); activity level (actometer); physiologic and biochemical measures (pulse, salivary cortisol, urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine); and nighttime sleep (video observation)

Secondary outcomes: none specified

Timing of outcome assessment/time points: first and last treatment days for nighttime sleep and urine cortisol/catecholamines; for all other outcomes: 1) 30 minutes before massage or video session, or both (baseline); 2) immediately before (pre-session); 3) immediately after (post-session); and 4) 30 minutes after session (follow-up)

stroke their child softly while reassuring them they were present and to read to their child for 20 to 30 minutes, once daily. Touch and reading took place during the same time period and did not occur independently of one another. Parents selected an age-appropriate book from a collection assembled by a Child Life Specialist. To minimize negative environmental auditory stimulation, parents were offered a choice of a fleece headband worn over the child's ears to: 1) solely reduce external noise or 2) deliver soft music. All parents chose music, and SleepPhones headbands (AcousticSheep LLC, Erie, PA) with pillow speakers were worn by PICU soothing group children after parents finished reading. The headbands remained on for up to one hour. Headbands were connected to iPods programmed with age-appropriate playlists, developed by a Music Therapist and verified with parents.

Control group (N = 10): usual care

Outcomes
Primary outcomes: acceptability and feasibility (survey and semi-structured interviews)

Secondary outcomes: psychological well-being, including distress (COMFORT Scale and Children's Critical Illness Impact Scale), anxiety (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and Post Hospital Behavior Questionnaire), and sleep outcomes (sleep diaries and actigraphy)

Timing of outcome assessment/time points: continuous actigraphy during hospitalization and at 3 months post-discharge for 5 nights. Questionnaires were completed on the ward and at home.

## Study characteristics

### Methods
- Type of publication: manuscript
- Study design: randomized controlled trial
- Study grouping: group randomization (by month of year)
- Country: USA
- Funding: Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation for Childhood Cancer, and St Jude Children’s Research Hospital Cancer Center Grant/Award (CA21765)
- Study period: 2008 to 2011
- Outcomes relevant to this review: validated objective measures of sleep
- Overall objective of study: to determine whether a sleep intervention compared with standard care was successful in preserving nighttime sleep in children with central nervous system cancers, hospitalized for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue, and to explore associations between sleep and fatigue during treatment

### Participants
- Setting: inpatient oncology floor
- Sample size: 33
- Dropouts: 4 children excluded for inadequate actigraphy data
- Mean age: 9.5 years (range 4 to 19)
- Sex: 20 boys, 13 girls
- Inclusion criteria: children with medulloblastoma or histologically similar CNS tumors, aged 4 to 19 years, able to self-report symptoms, and English-speaking parent and child
- Exclusion criteria: not specified

### Interventions
- Intervention (N = 17): multicomponent cognitive and behavioral interventions delivered by one of three trained research staff, including verbal and written age-appropriate sleep education, and relaxation training delivered on day 0. Following training, parents implemented a relaxation technique (e.g. storytelling, book reading, or massage) selected by the participant nightly, before lights out. Stimulus control measures, delivered daily throughout the study, were aimed at decreasing nighttime environmental sleep disrupters. They included establishing a lights-out time (including turning off electronic equipment) and morning lights-on time; choice of white noise program; thick black fabric placed over room windows to minimize light entry; and 90-minute protected sleep periods, with bundled care between periods, instituted by nursing staff from lights out to lights on.
- Control group (N = 16): standard nursing care with addition of personal time spent each evening with research staff as an attention-control measure

### Outcomes
- Primary outcomes: sleep outcomes by actigraphy: total sleep time (minutes), per cent sleep (%), mean duration of sleep episodes (minutes), sleep episodes (number), longest sleep episode (minutes), wake episodes (number), longest wake episode (number), and activity score (mean number of activity counts per epoch)
- Secondary outcomes: fatigue (Intensity on 5-point scale and Fatigue Scale-Child or Fatigue-Scale-Adolescent)
- Timing of outcome assessment/time points: actigraphy continuously through hospitalization and daily sleep diary completed by parents. Fatigue scales completed on Day 0, 1 to 4, and Day 5

### Notes
- Conflict of interest: none reported Cochrane Trusted evidence.

Administration: participants received a headset with music or dead air, once in the morning and once in the evening, for a total of 2 hours, for three days; therapy times were selected so that there were minimal disruptions. Treatments for sessions 1 and 2 of the day were the same (i.e. music/music, no music/no music).

**Outcomes**
Primary outcome(s): agitation or sedation level of participant, measured by RASS (scored from + 4 to -5; positive scores equal to various levels of aggression, whereas negative score equal to various levels of sedation; a score of 0 = an alert and calm participant)

Secondary outcome(s): alertness, measured by the Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor (scored from 0 to 100, where a score of 100 indicates the participant is fully awake, and a score of less than 40 is suggestive of a deep hypnotic effect)

Other outcome(s): other relevant sleep outcomes not specified

Timing of outcome assessment/time points: RASS and BIS scored once for each observed time point over three days

## Unit of analysis issues

### Cross-over trials
We did not encounter any studies that met this criteria.

### Multiple groups
We planned to manage studies including multiple, correlated comparisons by combining all relevant experimental groups of the study into one group and combining all relevant control groups into one group, to create a single pair-wise comparison, when possible. Had it not been possible to combine all relevant experimental groups of the study into one group, we would have split the control group to ensure participants were not double counted.

## Dealing with missing data
Had we not been able to obtain missing data from study authors, we planned to attempt to calculate missing statistics (e.g. correlation coefficients or standard deviations) from other available statistics (e.g. standard error or CI). We had planned to impute data using all available information, and for missing participant data, we had planned to impute the data using the last observation carried forward (LOCF). Had we made assumptions during imputation, we would have documented this on the data extraction sheet and reported it in the risk of bias tables. Had we imputed data, we would have conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact on the results. In summarizing aggregate data where LOCF was not possible, we had planned to address the potential impact of the missing data on the findings of the review in the Discussion section.

## Assessment of heterogeneity
We had planned to use the Ih statistic (%) to determine the proportion of variation between included studies that would have been due to heterogeneity; a value above 50% would have defined substantial statistical heterogeneity. We had also planned to examine the result of the Chih test (P < 0.10 = significant heterogeneity) and CI overlap of included studies, with visual inspection of the forest plot, where poor overlap would have been suggestive of heterogeneity. As we anticipated the likelihood of high variability in participants, interventions, and outcomes between studies would be great, we planned to report Tauh — an estimate of between-study variance — with use of a random-effects model.

## Assessment of reporting bias
If the meta-analysis had included more than 10 studies, we planned to draw a funnel plot and inspect it visually for asymmetry, which may have been caused by publication bias, or other small study effects attributable to, for example, poor methodological quality, true heterogeneity, or chance.

## Data Synthesis
We had planned to conduct a meta-analysis using Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5). We had planned to make separate comparisons between each category of intervention (i.e. environmental interventions, behavioral interventions, physical therapy, complementary and alternative therapies, and any other non-pharmacological intervention) and usual care or alternative interventions in each of the following three settings: NICU, PICU, and inpatient floor. We had planned to use a random-effects model to combine the results of trials included in the meta-analysis, as there would likely have been clinical and methodological heterogeneity. Using RevMan 5, we had planned to calculate the RR for dichotomous outcomes using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Had continuous outcomes been measured in the same way across studies, we would have summarized across-study MD estimates using the inverse variance method, with 95% CI and P values; we would have used the SMD when studies used different methods to measure the same outcome. If variance data had...

not been available, we would not have estimated the mean between-group difference with 95% CI and P values.

### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We had planned to conduct the subgroup analyses listed below by using the statistical test for subgroup differences. We were unable to undertake any subgroup analyses due to insufficient details, number of studies.

1. Age (neonates, 1 month to < 2 years, ≥ 2 years to < 6 years, ≥ 6 years to < 13 years, and ≥ 13 years to 18 years): age is an important effect modifier to consider, given developmental differences in sleep between infants, toddlers, children of school age, and adolescents.
2. Diagnosis or subspecialty unit (oncology, cardiology, surgical, etc.): diagnosis is an important effect modifier to consider, given the potential effect of different organ system pathology on sleep. Surgical pain can also impact sleep significantly.

### Sensitivity analysis
We planned to perform sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of the following issues, if they were present among the included studies. We did not conduct a meta-analysis.

1. Re-analysis excluding studies of lower methodological quality (higher risk of bias)
2. Re-analysis excluding studies published prior to 1990
3. Re-analysis including cluster-RCTs
4. Re-analysis considering decisions made regarding cross-over studies

### Appendix 3. Criteria for judging risk of bias in RCTs
**Random sequence generation (selection bias)**
1. Low risk of bias: sufficient use of a random component for adequate sequence generation (i.e. computer random number generator or random number tables)
2. High risk of bias: insufficient component of randomization (i.e. participants were assigned by date of birth or date of presentation)
3. Unclear risk of bias: authors did not sufficiently explain the randomization and how it was performed in order to permit a judgment of low or high risk of bias

**Allocation concealment (selection bias)**
1. Low risk of bias: adequate concealment of the allocation (i.e. use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes or telephone randomization)
2. High risk of bias: allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (i.e. open random number lists, odd or even date of birth)
3. Unclear risk of bias: uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (i.e. concealment method not known)

**Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)**
We did not assess blinding of participants and personnel, as study participants, families, and personnel would have been aware of the intervention they were receiving or implementing.

**Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)**
1. Low risk of bias: (a) no blinding of outcome assessment, but we judged that the outcome measurement was not likely to have been influenced by the lack of blinding; or (b) blinding of outcome assessment was ensured
2. High risk of bias: there was no blinding, and the outcome measurement was likely to have been influenced by the lack of blinding
3. Unclear risk of bias: blinding of outcome assessor was not reported, and could not be confirmed through contact with study authors

- (a) no missing outcome data;
- (b) reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the true outcome (for survival data, censoring was unlikely to introduce bias);
- (c) missing outcome data were balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups;
- (d) for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have had a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate;
- (e) for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have had a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size;
- (f) missing data were imputed using appropriate methods

2. High risk of bias: missing data were not accounted for, not imputed using appropriate methods, or not evenly distributed between groups

3. Unclear risk of bias: missing data or losses to follow-up, or both, were not reported

Selective reporting (reporting bias)

1. Low risk of bias:
- (a) the study protocol was available, and all of the study’s prespecified (primary and secondary) outcomes that were of interest in the review were reported in the prespecified way;
- (b) the study protocol was not available, but it was clear that the published reports had included all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified

2. High risk of bias: not all prespecified primary outcomes were reported

3. Unclear risk of bias: not enough information to determine if the study was at low or high risk of reporting bias

Other potential sources of bias

1. Low risk of bias: study was free from other apparent sources of bias

2. High risk of bias: there was a potential, additional source(s) of bias that was not captured by the other domains (i.e. bias related to study design)

3. Unclear risk of bias: not enough information to determine if the study was at low or high risk of other bias

This review differs from the original protocol as outlined below:

1. It focuses on children and adolescents in the inpatient setting, excluding infants in the neonatal ICU, for whom a recent review has been published, and due to substantial differences in sleep architecture between preterm and full term neonates, and older infants and children.

2. In the protocol, we stated we would include studies with participants above or below the stated age range if separate data could be obtained, however, we did not identify studies that met these criteria as well as the other inclusion criteria.

3. We excluded studies if they did not report any outcomes relevant to sleep (objective or subjective measures, outlined in Primary outcomes), given the focus of the review, and the fact that interventions, like physical activity, massage, etc. are used for a multitude of purposes.

4. The protocol stated we would include validated parent and nurse surveys; however, we did not identify any validated surveys. Thus, we removed this inclusion criteria to facilitate a more inclusive review, to guide future research, and highlight the need for validated tools in this domain.

5. We identified considerable clinical heterogeneity across the included studies in participant populations, measurement tools and metrics used, study duration, and timing of outcome assessment. Thus, we were unable to pool the results in a meta-analysis for any of the outcomes, and presented mostly narrative measures of treatment effect. When possible, we calculated between-group differences and 95% confidence intervals for individual studies. When data were insufficient to provide this information, we presented them as described in Data synthesis, and used SWiM reporting guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook.
