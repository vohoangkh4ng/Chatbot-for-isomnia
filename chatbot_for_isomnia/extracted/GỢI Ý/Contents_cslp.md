## Section 1: Delivery of CBT-I in Specific Populations

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-i) in School-Aged Children and Adolescents
Insomnia is one of the most prevalent sleep disorders in school-aged children and adolescents. Although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) is the first-line treatment for adults, and existing studies show promising effects also for children and adolescents, the number of randomized controlled trials in younger age groups is rather small. CBT-i techniques for school-aged children and adolescents include bedtime shifts (including sleep restriction), stimulus control, thought challenging, psychoeducation, and relaxation techniques. The integration of parents, especially in school-aged children with insomnia, is highly recommended. More research is needed to investigate specific characteristics and models of child and adolescent insomnia.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Patients with Medical and Psychiatric Comorbidities
Insomnia is highly comorbid with other mental health and medical conditions and adversely affects quality of life and daytime functioning. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a safe and efficacious treatment for insomnia in the context of various comorbid conditions. In this article, the authors outline considerations for delivering CBT-I in patients with the most common co-occurring medical and mental health conditions, review the evidence for CBT-I in these populations as well as special considerations for its application, and highlight future areas for research in the area of CBT-I for comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Depression
This article reviews the literature on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in adults and adolescents with depression. Recent research has expanded on previous research, which established that sleep problems are an important predictor of depression and that sleep problems are associated with more severe depression, more suicidality, and worse outcomes for treatment of depression. The relationship between sleep problems and depression is complex, likely bidirectional, and impactful. To further improve the lives of patients with depression who experience insomnia, it will be important to investigate which patients will do better in a sequential versus concomitant approach.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia and Women’s Health: Sex as a Biological Variable
Differences in sleep for men and women begin at a very early age, with women reporting poorer sleep and having a higher risk for insomnia compared with men. ## Contents

Women are particularly vulnerable to developing insomnia during times of reproductive hormonal change. Sleep across the woman’s lifespan and special treatment considerations for using cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in women will be addressed in this review.

### Delivering Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Military Personnel and Veterans
Insomnia is commonly reported by military populations, especially those with co-morbid mental and physical health conditions. Co-occurring conditions result in an altered presentation of insomnia symptoms, and complicate provision of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), requiring supplementary assessment or modifications to traditional techniques. CBT-I has consistently demonstrated positive outcomes for active-duty service members and veterans, even in the context of significant comorbidities such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, sleep apnea, and chronic pain. Despite its promise, studies of CBT-I in some populations, including women and individuals with substance use disorders, remain relatively understudied in active-duty and veteran populations.

### Section 2: New Alternatives to CBT-I or Adaptations of CBT-I
#### A Meta-Analysis of Mindfulness-Based Therapies for Insomnia and Sleep Disturbance: Moving Towards Processes of Change
Mindfulness-based therapies (MBTs) are increasingly being investigated as a treatment for insomnia and general sleep disturbance, but significant gaps remain in the evidence base. In this article, the authors present (1) a unifying psychological process model that relates mindfulness to sleep; (2) a systematic review of the literature reporting on trials of MBTs for insomnia and sleep disturbance, which includes an assessment of quality of trial reporting, adaptation of MBTs for sleep, and whether mindfulness practice was associated with effects observed; and (3) a meta-analysis of MBTs for insomnia and sleep disturbance compared with attention/education and waitlist control groups.

#### Brief Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia
Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBTI) is an effective treatment of insomnia; however, there are insufficient CBTI providers for the 10% to 25% of the population who have insomnia. Brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBTI) is a 4-session manualized treatment paradigm administrable in medical settings by nonpsychologist health professionals. BBTI is effective in reducing symptoms of insomnia, such as sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency. In some cases, BBTI resulted in full remission from insomnia. Ongoing clinical trials are further testing the efficacy of BBTI using alternative treatment deliveries and in primary medical care settings.

#### Intensive Sleep Retraining Treatment of Insomnia
Effective and durable cognitive/behavioral therapies for insomnia are time consuming and not readily available to the large insomnia population. Intensive sleep retraining (ISR) provides multiple (>40) short (<5-minute) sleep latencies over a 24-hour period. Two pilot studies and a randomized controlled trial have shown that ISR is an Contents

immediately effective and durable treatment of sleep-onset insomnia. Its major disad-
vantage of dependence on sleep laboratory resources has now been overcome with
the development of wearable devices using behavioral responses as the indicator of
sleep onset to allow for the inexpensive, practical administration of ISR at home.

## Section 3: Considerations and Controversies Related to CBT-I

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapies for Insomnia and Hypnotic Medications: Considerations and Controversies
Insomnia is a costly health problem, where management has remained suboptimal
despite advances in the understanding and treatment of the condition. This article
provides an overview of the evidence-based treatment options of insomnia, looking
at short-term and long-term therapeutic outcomes for cognitive behavioral therapies
and pharmacologic therapies. Key issues of treatment delivery and implementation
are highlighted at the patient and health system levels, and novel approaches for
combining and sequencing treatment to maximize therapeutic outcomes for
insomnia are discussed. The impact of recent updates of major clinical guidelines
and future research directions for the field are discussed.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia and Acute Insomnia: Considerations and Controversies
The term “acute insomnia” has been part of the language of sleep medicine since the
late 1970s. Despite that, a comprehensive research agenda on the topic has only
recently been advanced. This has prevented a clinical viewpoint on the assessment
and management of acute insomnia. Although there is a cognitive behavioral therapy
for insomnia focused intervention, designed to circumvent the transition from acute
insomnia to insomnia disorder, the results from trials undertaken have been variable
and limited by small sample sizes. There is much work to be done regarding the
assessment, diagnosis, and management of acute insomnia.

### Delivering Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in the Real World: Considerations and Controversies
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has emerged as the first-line treat-
ment for chronic insomnia but remains massively underused relative to the preva-
lence of insomnia disorder. This article focuses on 3 key issues in the delivery of
CBT-I in the real world. First, where and how should CBT-I be delivered and who
should deliver it? Second, who is an appropriate candidate for CBT-I? Third, how
do you measure quality care with CBT-I? These issues give rise to targets for future
research aimed at improving the implementation science of CBT-I in the real world.

### Online Delivery of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Insomnia: Considerations and Controversies
This article reviews the current state of research and clinical use of online delivery of
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Strengths and limitations of this treatment
modality are discussed, as well as exploration of some of the controversies in the
field that are still under exploration. In addition, the article explores future areas of
research to test out the role of this treatment as an entry level into a stepped care
model of insomnia.
