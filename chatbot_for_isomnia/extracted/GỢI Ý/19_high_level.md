# Title: Non-pharmacological interventions to improve sleep quality and quantity for hospitalized adult patientsâ€”co-produced study with surgical patient partners: systematic review

## Summary: This systematic review investigates non-pharmacological interventions aimed at enhancing sleep quality and quantity among hospitalized adult patients, particularly surgical patients who are at increased risk of sleep disruption due to surgical stress and postoperative pain. The review includes 59 studies involving 14,035 patients and identifies 13 unique interventions, highlighting the importance of improving the sleep environment and utilizing relaxation techniques. Despite the potential benefits of these interventions, the review notes a lack of high-quality evidence and standardized sleep measurement, indicating a moderate to high risk of bias across the studies.
