# Title: Why garden? â€“ Attitudes and the perceived health benefits of home gardening

## Summary: This article investigates the psychological and physical health benefits associated with home gardening, an activity that has been underexplored compared to other urban green spaces. Through a survey of 5766 gardeners and 249 non-gardeners in the UK, the research examines motivations for gardening and the perceived health benefits. Findings indicate that frequent gardening (2-3 times a week) correlates with improved well-being, reduced stress, and increased physical activity. While health improvement is not the primary motivation for gardening, participants reported significant pleasure from the activity. The study advocates for greater recognition of domestic gardens in urban planning due to their health benefits.
