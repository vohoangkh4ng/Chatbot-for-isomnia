# Title: The associations between plantâ€‘based dietary indices with depression and quality of life and insomnia among Iranian adolescent girls

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between plant-based dietary indices and mental health outcomes, specifically depression, quality of life, and insomnia, among 733 adolescent girls in northeastern Iran. Utilizing validated assessment tools, the research found that a healthy plant-based dietary index is linked to lower odds of insomnia, while an unhealthy index correlates with higher chances of depression. The findings suggest the need for further studies to confirm these associations.
