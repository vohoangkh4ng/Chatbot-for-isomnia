# Title: Later school start times in a flexible system improve teenage sleep

## Summary: This article investigates the impact of flexible school start times on teenage sleep patterns. It highlights the pervasive issue of sleep deprivation among teenagers and presents evidence that delaying school start times can be an effective solution. The study monitored students over a period of nine weeks, comparing sleep duration and quality between those starting school at 8 am and those starting at 9 am. Results showed that students who opted for later start times slept 1.1 hours longer, experienced improved sleep quality, and reported higher satisfaction with the flexible system. However, overall sleep duration did not significantly increase compared to baseline, suggesting that frequent use of the later start option is crucial for maximizing benefits. The findings underscore the potential of flexible school start times to enhance adolescent sleep and cognitive outcomes.
