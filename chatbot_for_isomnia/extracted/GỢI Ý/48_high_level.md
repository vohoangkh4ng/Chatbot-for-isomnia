# Title: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial

## Summary: This study investigates the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in improving sleep quality and reducing PTSD symptoms in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Conducted as a randomized controlled trial with 45 participants, the results indicate that CBT-I significantly enhances sleep outcomes compared to a waitlist control group, with improvements in sleep duration, subjective sleep quality, and overall psychosocial functioning. The benefits of CBT-I were sustained at a 6-month follow-up, suggesting its potential as a valuable component in the treatment of PTSD. Further research is recommended to explore the relationship between CBT-I and nightmares.
