# PIPPAH SUPPLEMENT

## Introduction

PIPPAH was initiated in 1995 by the Office of Adolescent Health of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), Health Resources and Services Administration, US Department of Health and Human Services. This public/private initiative is designed to promote an adolescent health agenda among professional organizations. The American Dietetic Association (ADA) is one of several organizations that compose PIPPAH. The other participating organizations are the American Medical Association; the American Bar Association; the American Nursing Association; and the National Association of Social Work.

Since 1935, MCHB has increased the resources it devotes to the enhancement of adolescent health. Because the most prevalent health risks facing adolescents today involve psychological, behavioral, and economic factors, MCHB envisioned that much progress could be made by funding and directing coordinated efforts among health, mental health, and law-related organizations.

PIPPAH's main objectives to achieve the goal of improving adolescent health status include the following:
- To have an impact on the infrastructure of each participating organization
- To increase the awareness of the members in the participating organizations on behalf of adolescent health and well-being
- To encourage collaboration across disciplines and professional organizations to improve members' knowledge and skills in working with adolescents.

ADA has developed an adolescent health agenda within the organization. Many successful projects have been undertaken by ADA, including this Journal supplement, which addresses these overall PIPPAH objectives. I hope you will find this supplement to the Journal of The American Dietetic Association to be a valuable resource in assisting you to address the unique nutrition needs of adolescents.
