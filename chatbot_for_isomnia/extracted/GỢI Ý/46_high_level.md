# Title: Gut microbiota and glucometabolic alterations in response to recurrent partial sleep deprivation in normal-weight young individuals

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of recurrent partial sleep deprivation (PSD) on gut microbiota and metabolic health in normal-weight young men. Through a randomized crossover design, the researchers found that PSD led to significant changes in microbiota composition, including an increased Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio and alterations in specific microbial families associated with metabolic disturbances. Additionally, insulin sensitivity was negatively affected following PSD compared to normal sleep. The findings suggest that short-term sleep loss can subtly influence gut microbiota, warranting further research to explore its implications for metabolic health.
