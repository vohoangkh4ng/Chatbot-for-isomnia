# Title: Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Pediatric Prolonged-Release Melatonin for Insomnia in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder

## Summary: This article investigates the long-term efficacy and safety of prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) in treating insomnia among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurogenetic disorders. Following a previous 13-week double-blind study, a prospective follow-up was conducted with 95 subjects who received nightly doses of PedPRM for up to 52 weeks. Results indicated significant improvements in sleep duration, latency, and quality, with a majority of participants experiencing enhanced sleep patterns. The treatment was generally safe, with minimal adverse effects reported, suggesting that PedPRM is a viable long-term option for managing insomnia in this population.
