# Title: Embodiment: I sat, I felt, I performed â€“ Posture effects on mood and cognitive performance

## Summary: This article explores the relationship between physical posture, mood states, and cognitive performance. It builds on previous findings that suggest upright postures can induce positive mood states, which in turn may enhance processing speed in cognitive tasks. The study investigates the effects of implicitly manipulated postures on mood and cognitive performance, revealing that participants adopting an upright posture reported a more positive mood and increased processing speed compared to those in stooped postures. However, no differences in processing accuracy were observed, and the proposed mediation by mood states was not supported by the data.
