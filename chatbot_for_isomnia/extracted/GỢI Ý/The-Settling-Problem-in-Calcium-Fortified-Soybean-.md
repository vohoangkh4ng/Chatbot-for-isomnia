### The Settling Problem in Calcium-Fortified Soybean Drinks

To the Editor:
Reilly and colleagues recently reported on the acceptability of sweetened, flavored soymilk by elementary school children. The authors characterized fortified soymilk as containing calcium equivalent to dairy milk. Natural soymilk is a poor source of calcium; therefore, calcium salts—most commonly tricalcium phosphate and calcium carbonate—must be added to make soy calcium-rich.

However, bioequivalence cannot be assumed from the mere addition of a fortificant. Nor can one assume that the added calcium will even be ingested. In a study of calcium-fortified soymilk, Zhao and colleagues concluded that the products tested could be a “good source of calcium provided . . . [the] fortificant remains well dispersed and is actually consumed.” This matter of dispersion has not received adequate attention generally, and was ignored by Reilly and colleagues.

In screening for potential bioavailability of beverage fortificants, we previously noted that some soy beverages, as marketed, exhibited appreciable sedimentation of the added calcium. We have subsequently studied this issue more systematically and report here that the problem is widespread, involves both tricalcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, and causes actually ingested calcium from these beverages to be much less than the labeled content.

We evaluated eight national brands of soy beverages fortified to labeled levels ranging from 200 to 500 mg calcium/serving, including the brand studied by Reilly and colleagues. We poured two servings of each, one with prior vigorous shaking and one without. (The beverages concerned all carried instructions to shake before using.) We measured the calcium content of each serving by ashing the samples and analyzing the ash solution by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. We then decanted the remaining beverage, cut open the cartons, and scraped the residue from the bottoms. This residue was similarly ashed and analyzed for calcium.

The unshaken samples had measurable calcium that averaged just 31% of the labeled content. Shaking resulted in improvement to a mean level of 59%, still well short of the labeled content. In all cases the calcium residue made up for what was missing from the poured servings. The foregoing average values obscured large differences between products. Two, when shaken, contained a level of calcium consistent with the label, while one failed to reach even 20% of the labeled content. These differences were not related to the calcium salt employed, to the fortification level, nor to the refrigeration/shelf-stable status. In brief, settling was severe enough in six of the eight products to preclude full resuspension with even moderately vigorous shaking, and not one of the products was free of appreciable sedimentation under typical usage.

As the quantity of calcium added to these beverages to produce nutritionally useful calcium content far exceeds the solubility of tricalcium phosphate or calcium carbonate, there are obvious technical problems that manufacturers must overcome if they are to provide a calcium-fortified product that delivers anything remotely approaching the labeled content. Food and nutrition professionals should understand that soy beverages, while wholesome and nutritious foods in their own right, are not substitutes for dairy milk, irrespective of whether the addition of sugar and flavorings make them acceptable to school children. One might conclude from Reilly and colleagues that mere addition of calcium would be sufficient to make them an equivalent dairy alternative, but that is manifestly not the case.

While the issue here goes beyond bioavailability, it must also be noted that calcium from a tricalcium phosphate or calcium carbonate fortified soymilk is not equivalent to cow’s milk in young women.
