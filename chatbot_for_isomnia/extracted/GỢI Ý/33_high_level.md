# Title: Cognitive and Behavioral Interventions to Improve Sleep in School-Age Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

## Summary: This article presents a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effectiveness of cognitive and behavioral sleep interventions for school-age children and adolescents. The study highlights that sleep problems are prevalent in this demographic and can exacerbate other disorders. The analysis included six randomized controlled trials with a total of 528 participants, revealing that while self-reported total sleep time did not show significant improvement, actigraphy indicated a positive effect. The interventions led to a decrease in sleep onset latency and maintained positive effects over short-term follow-ups. However, the authors caution that due to the heterogeneity of treatment protocols and high risk of bias, the results should be interpreted carefully, emphasizing the need for larger, more rigorous trials.
