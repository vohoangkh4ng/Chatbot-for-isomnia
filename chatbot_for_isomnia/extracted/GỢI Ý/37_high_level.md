# Title: Effects of transdiagnostic group treatment for sleep disturbances in adult attentionâ€‘deficit/hyperactivity disorders and autistic spectrum disorder: a pilot study

## Summary: This pilot study investigates the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic group treatment aimed at addressing sleep disturbances in adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The intervention, which included sleep scheduling and regularity, was conducted over five weeks with ten participants. Results indicated significant improvements in sleep disturbances immediately after the intervention and at a three-month follow-up, along with reductions in specific ASD symptoms. This study highlights the potential of a psychological approach to improve sleep and related symptoms in this population.
