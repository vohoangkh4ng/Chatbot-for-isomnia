Does splitting sleep improve long-term memory in chronically sleep deprived adolescents?

Sleep aids the encoding and consolidation of declarative memories, but many adolescents do not obtain the recommended amount of sleep each night. After a normal night of sleep, there is abundant evidence that a daytime nap enhances the consolidation of material learned before sleep and also improves the encoding of new information upon waking. However, it remains unclear how learning is affected when sleep is split between nocturnal and daytime nap periods during a typical school week of restricted sleep. We compared long-term memory in 58 adolescents who underwent two simulated school weeks of suboptimal continuous (6.5 h nocturnal sleep opportunity) or split sleep (5 h nocturnal sleep +1.5 h daytime nap at 14:00). In the first week, participants encoded pictures in the late afternoon on Day 5 and were tested after 2-nights of recovery sleep. On 3 consecutive days in the second week, participants learned about six species of amphibians in the morning, and six different amphibians in the late afternoon. Testing was performed in the evening following a night of recovery sleep. In the first week, the split sleep group recognized more pictures. In the second week, they remembered more facts about species learned in the afternoon. Groups did not differ for species learned in the morning. This suggests that under conditions of sleep restriction, a split sleep schedule benefits learning after a nap opportunity without impairing morning learning, despite less preceding nocturnal sleep. While not replacing adequate nocturnal sleep, a split sleep schedule may be beneficial for chronically sleep restricted learners.

INTRODUCTION

These findings suggest that it might be preferable to split available sleep time between a nocturnal bout and a daytime nap. Critically however, prior experimental research exploring the memory benefits of napping has only examined napping as a fixed amount of nocturnal sleep. Actigraphically assessed sleep length has been consistently shown to dip below 6 h on weekday nights for adolescents in East Asia. Sleep restriction is associated with poorer academic performance and a reduced capacity to encode new information. Delaying school start times and setting limits on bedtime can improve adolescent sleep, but implementing these will entail significant effort and take time to employ effectively. In the interim, it remains an open challenge to improve learning given the restricted sleep adolescents currently obtain.

A handful of studies—conducted in adults with a view to optimize splitting sleep into nocturnal and afternoon nap periods—controlled for total sleep obtained or two equivalent periods across 24 h. Performance on a battery of cognitive tests was compared with continuous nocturnal sleep of the same overall duration. Measures of subjective alertness, psychomotor vigilance and processing speed were found to be determined by total sleep obtained, rather than how that sleep was distributed across the day. It remains to be determined how long-term memory is affected when learning takes place under a similar split sleep schedule.

To address these gaps in our knowledge, we compared long-term memory in adolescents who learned across two simulated school weeks. | SRI1 | SR12 | SR13 | SR14 | SR15 | R11 | R12 | SR21 | SR22 | SR23 | R21 | R22 |

Fig. 1 Study Protocol. The study began with 2 baseline nights (B1–B2) of 9 h nocturnal sleep opportunity followed by the first school week period, during which one group were provided with a 6.5 h nocturnal sleep opportunity (00:15–06:45) and the other group 5 h nocturnal sleep opportunity (01:00–06:00) with a 1.5 h afternoon nap (14:00–15:30). This was followed by a “weekend” recovery period of 9 h nocturnal sleep opportunity (R11–R12). The second weekday (SR21–SR23) and weekend recovery period (R21–R22) of the experiment matched the first, except with 3-days of manipulation rather than 5. Picture encoding began at the end of the first manipulation period (SR15) and was tested after two nights of recovery (R1). Learning of factual knowledge took place in the morning and afternoon on each weekday of the second manipulation period (SR21–SR23) and was tested after one night of weekend recovery sleep (R21).

Fig. 2 Stimuli. a Factual knowledge encoding consisted of detailed information about 12 species of amphibians presented on slides. The test probed 360 2-alternative forced choice questions of varying difficulty, each followed by a confidence rating. b For the picture encoding task, participants viewed 160 images each followed by a building/no-building judgment. During retrieval, 160 old images were presented with an additional 80 new images, and participants indicated their confidence that it was an old or new image on a 5-point scale.

weeks of restricted sleep in a naturalistic school setting, where sleep opportunities on each day were either split into 5 h nocturnal sleep and a 1.5 h daytime nap, or 6.5 h of continuous nocturnal sleep (Fig. 1). During the second week and for three consecutive days, participants spent an hour learning detailed facts about six amphibians in the morning, and another hour learning about six different amphibians after the nap in the late afternoon (Factual Knowledge Task; Fig. 2a). Participants were then tested the following evening after recovery sleep (9 h time-in-bed (TIB)). This makes provision for both groups being rested during retrieval, so that observed memory effects could be reasonably assigned to the effects of splitting sleep on prior encoding and/or consolidation, rather than retrieval. We determined whether memory for material learned in the morning and afternoon would differ between groups, since there are different encoding and consolidation advantages for each.

relative loss of nocturnal sleep in the split sleep group could impair their ability to encode in the morning. However, the subsequent nap might compensate by enhancing consolidation of what was learned.

RESULTS

Actigraphy

Term-time sleep habits were actigraphically assessed for a one-week period occurring within 5 months prior to commencement of the study. Participants demonstrated a common pattern of shortened sleep on weekdays (TIB = 6.83 ± 0.94, total-sleep-time (TST) = 5.44 ± 0.84) and extension of sleep on weekends (TIB = 8.31 ± 1.00, TST = 6.69 ± 0.96; Table 1). Participants also adhered to a sleep schedule (23:00–08:00) in the week prior to commencement of the study, confirmed with actigraphy (TIB = 8.9 ± 0.37, TST = 7.45 ± 0.53). Actigraphy and polysomnography during the study indicated that TST was effectively altered in line with our experiment design during each night of the experiment.

Memory

Picture encoding. Encoding took place after five days on the split/continuous sleep schedule (14:45 on day SR15). Participants incidentally encoded pictures of landscapes by making building/no-building judgments and were not informed that memory for images would be tested later. Both groups were highly accurate at judging pictures to contain a building or not (6.5 h = 0.94 ± 0.06; split sleep = 0.97 ± 0.03) and significantly higher in the split sleep group, t(56) = 2.241, p = 0.029. Fig. 3   Memory performance. a For picture encoding, accuracy was higher and response times were faster for the split sleep group during the building/no-building judgments at encoding (SR15). Picture recognition scores (A′) were also significantly higher for the split sleep group. b Memory in the factual knowledge task for species learned in the afternoon was significantly better in the split sleep group, while morning learning was not significantly different between groups. Mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01

During retrieval 48 h later (16:45 on day R1), all participants indicated that they were unaware they would be tested for their memory of the previous session. Recognition of previously viewed images was tested alongside new images. The signal detection measure A′ was utilized to assess memory as it corrects for response bias. A′ scores were significantly higher in the split sleep group, t(56) = 2.505, p = 0.015, Cohen’s d = 0.66 (Table 2). These findings indicate a clear afternoon encoding advantage associated with a split sleep schedule.

Factual knowledge task—pretest. Participants performed a pretest prior to learning to establish their existing knowledge about amphibians. Two-alternative forced choice questions tested general facts about amphibians (general knowledge), specific facts about the species they were about to learn (specific knowledge), and ability to identify species from images (picture identification). Participants were also asked to rate their subjective level of knowledge and disgust (1 = low, 9 = high) when presented with a picture of each species. There were no significant group differences for general knowledge, t(56) = 1.395, p = 0.168, specific knowledge, t(56) = 0.579, p = 0.565, or picture identification t(56) = 0.349, p = 0.728. General knowledge about amphibians was relatively low (M = 61.55 ± 10.44% correct, chance level 50%), but significantly above chance (p < 0.001). Specific knowledge (M = 49.66 ± 9.03%) and picture identification (M = 52.88 ± 12.31%) did not differ from chance (p > 0.05). There was a non-significant trend for subjective knowledge to be higher in the continuous sleep group, t(56) = 1.843, p = 0.071, but ratings in this group were still very low considering a score of 1 represented “no knowledge” (M = 1.42 ± 0.64). On average participants rated all species as moderately disgusting (M = 4.69 ± 2.32), but these ratings did not differ between groups, t(56) = 1.069, p = 0.289.

Factual knowledge task—retrieval. Retrieval was tested at 20:30 on day SR21 via two-alternative forced choice questions, followed by confidence ratings (certain, somewhat certain and guess). Responses within each rating were corrected for response bias (correct–incorrect). Any group differences were expected to be present for participant’s most confident memories (certain). Table 2.

responses), which are the least prone to noise introduced by guessing. For certain memories, a mixed ANOVA with group (split sleep/continuous sleep) and time (morning/afternoon) showed a significant main effect of group, F(1,56) = 4.172, p = 0.046, an interaction, F(1,56) = 5.646, p = 0.021, but no effect of time, F(1,56) = 0.117, p = 0.734. Independent samples t-tests revealed significantly better memory of species learned in the afternoon for the split sleep group relative to the continuous sleep group, t(56) = 2.7, p = 0.009, Cohen’s d = 0.71, while groups did not differ significantly for morning learning, t(56) = 1.189, p = 0.239, Cohen’s d = 0.31. Within the split sleep group, the higher performance for afternoon compared to morning learning was significant, t(28) = 2.088, p = 0.046, while the numerically lower performance for afternoon compared to morning learning observed in the continuous sleep group was not, t(28) = 1.34, p = 0.191. This indicates that a split sleep schedule improves afternoon learning without any cost to morning learning. Overall memory showed a trend for a main group effect, F(1,56) = 3.825, p = 0.055, but no effect of time, F(1,56) = 0.363, p = 0.549, and no interaction, F(1,56) = 1.008, p = 0.32. Planned comparisons showed a similar pattern to certain memory, with a significantly better memory for afternoon learning in the split sleep group, t(56) = 2.177, p = 0.034, Cohen’s d = 0.57, but no group difference for morning learning, t(56) = 1.467, p = 0.148, Cohen’s d = 0.39, and no within group differences between morning and afternoon learning (p > 0.19). There were no significant main effects or interactions for somewhat certain (group: F(1,56) = 0.273, p = 0.603, time: F(1,56) = 0.343, p = 0.561, group * time interaction: F(1,56) = 1.743, p = 0.192), or guess responses (group: F(1,56) = 0.15, p = 0.7, time: F(1,56) = 1.388, p = 0.244, group * time interaction: F(1,56) = 0.637, p = 0.428).

Factual knowledge task—subjective measures. We explored whether a split sleep schedule impacted on participant’s subjective impressions of their learning capabilities while they were studying the material. We asked four questions that probed subjective motivation, focus on the task, ability to learn, and alertness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale: KSS). Morning and afternoon sessions consisted of two 30 min blocks separated by a | Morning          | Afternoon                             | Morning           | Afternoon          |

2 min break. Questions were administered during the break and at the end of the block. Ratings were collapsed across all three days to create separate means for morning and afternoon sessions (Fig. 4). ANOVA including group (split sleep, continuous sleep) and time (morning, afternoon) identified no main effects for focus, ability, or motivation (p > 0.05), but there were significant time * group interactions for focus, F(1,56) = 7.724, p = 0.007, and ability, F(1,56) = 5.976, p = 0.018. Consistent with the memory findings, focus on the task was significantly higher in the split sleep group in the afternoon, t(56) = 2.647, p = 0.011, but groups did not differ in the morning session, t(56) = 0.894, p = 0.375. The interaction for ability showed a similar pattern (Fig. 4b), but direct group comparisons did not differ in morning or afternoon sessions (p > 0.05). Subjective alertness showed a significant main effect of time, F(1,56) = 13.072, p = 0.001, and a group * time interaction F(1,56) = 25.62. p < 0.001, but no group effect, F(1,56) = 2.6, p = 0.112. Alertness was significantly higher in the afternoon for the split sleep group, t(56) = 3.34, p = 0.001, but groups did not differ in the morning, t(56) = 0.291, p = 0.772. Last, we correlated these subjective measures with certain memory scores within the appropriate time period (e.g., morning alertness with memory for species learned in the morning) within each group separately, making 16 comparisons in total (false discovery rate corrected). Significant relationships were only observed for the split sleep group, where memory for morning species was positively correlated with focus (Rs = 0.52, p = 0.004) and ability (Rs = 0.532, p = 0.003), while afternoon memory correlated significantly with ability (Rs = 0.519, p = 0.004). To summarize, the split sleep schedule led to higher levels of subjective alertness and focus in the afternoon after the nap, although correlations between these subjective measures and afternoon memory were not significant.

Psychomotor vigilance and memory task response times. Psychomotor vigilance was assessed shortly before the learning (10:15 and 16:30) and test sessions for picture encoding (16:30) and the factual knowledge task (20:15). Response times during both tasks were also analyzed as indirect measures of alertness, although note that participants were instructed to respond as accurately as possible for both memory tasks without any mention of the speed of responses. Prior to picture encoding (16:30 on SR1 5), the continuous sleep group had significantly more lapses, t(56) = 4.806, p < 0.001. Response times during the encoding task were also significantly slower in the continuous sleep group, t(56) = 2.615, p = 0.011, providing a congruent indication of reduced vigilance/sustained attention during the encoding session. Prior to picture retrieval (16:30 on R1 2), the continuous sleep group still had significantly more lapses, t(56) = 2.607, p = 0.012, but this time they were faster to respond than the split sleep group during the picture retrieval session at 16:45, t(56) = 4.387, p < 0.001. The higher number of lapses for the continuous sleep group prior to picture retrieval raises the possibility that observed memory impairments are related to lapses of attention during retrieval, rather than a deficit to prior encoding. However, PVT lapses (16:30 on R12) did not significantly correlate with memory (A′) in either experimental group (p > 0.05). # Continuous sleep

Groups did not differ in the morning, t(56) = 0.851, p = 0.398, although the split sleep group had significantly fewer lapses than the continuous sleep group in the afternoon t(56) = 4.987, p < 0.001.

There were no group differences for the PVT performed before the factual knowledge retrieval test at 20:15 on R21, t(56) = 1.269, p = 0.21. Similar to the picture encoding task, response times during retrieval were significantly faster in the continuous sleep group, t(56) = 2.147, p = 0.036.

# Polysomnography

When considering total sleep during each 24 h period (i.e., nocturnal and nap sleep combined for the split sleep group), the split sleep schedule was associated with consistently reduced TST (Fig. 5). There were two consistent changes in sleep architecture throughout the protocol. First, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep for the split sleep group was significantly reduced on two separate days in the first (SR13) and second week (SR21) (p < 0.01). Second, the continuous sleep group obtained significantly more slow wave sleep (SWS) on recovery days R11 and R21 (p < 0.01), indicating greater accumulation of sleep pressure in participants who did not nap in the afternoon prior to recovery sleep (see Supplementary Table 1 for nap sleep macrostructure).

Group comparison of only nocturnal sleep showed the expected decrease in TST on all SR days for the split sleep group, and significantly reduced time spent in all sleep stages (p < 0.05) except for N1 (p > 0.05). Subsequent analyses focused on sleep stage duration during sleep periods within 24 h of each task. For picture encoding, nocturnal and afternoon nap sleep times were combined (SR15). Although groups did not significantly differ in the length of any individual sleep stage (p > 0.05), the split sleep group had significantly lower total sleep time, t(53) = 3.173, p = 0.003, by approximately 15 min (split sleep: M = 350.52 ± 19.36 min; continuous sleep: M = 365.24 ± 14.64 min). Certain memory did not significantly correlate with any sleep stage duration or TST (p > 0.05).

Since learning in the factual knowledge task took place over 3 days (SR21–SR23), we examined averaged sleep characteristics across the two days where PSG was recorded (SR21 and SR23; Fig. 5). For combined night and daytime sleep, TST was again significantly lower in the split sleep group (split sleep: M = 354.71 ± 9.57 min; continuous sleep: M = 366.69 ± 9.41 min), t(53) = 4.682, p < 0.001. Analysis of macrostructure showed that REM sleep duration was significantly reduced by splitting sleep.

In the second week of the experiment, lapses for PVT’s (split sleep: M = 64.0 ± 17.38 min; continuous sleep: M = 75.36 ± 13.55 min), t(53) = 2.697, p = 0.009, while other sleep stages did not differ (p > 0.05). Again, certain memory in the morning or afternoon did not correlate significantly with any of these sleep metrics (p > 0.05). # DISCUSSION

We assessed the incidental encoding of pictures and learning of educationally realistic factual knowledge in sleep restricted adolescents under two sleep schedules: split sleep and continuous sleep. We found that splitting sleep between a nocturnal period (5 h sleep opportunity) and a short daytime nap (1.5 h sleep opportunity) resulted in better recall of learned material compared to a purely nocturnal schedule with the same total sleep (6.5 h), specifically for information learned after the nap in the afternoon. It is important to note that while splitting sleep had no adverse effects for declarative memory, several other cognitive faculties linked to REM sleep may have been affected, including procedural memory, creative problem solving, and emotional regulation. With regard to the latter, recently published data from the current study protocol showed that the split sleep schedule was associated with improved positive mood, despite reductions in total time spent in REM sleep. The split sleep schedule could be optimized to facilitate REM sleep, for example by slightly extending morning sleep, or taking naps earlier in the morning.

These findings expand upon prior observations that a daytime nap benefits long-term memory by showing that improvements remain under a habitual napping schedule when total available sleep time is matched between nap and no-nap conditions. Further studies are needed to optimize sleep schedules, establishing a balance between the cognitive benefits associated with these different aspects of sleep and the practicality of translating this behavior to schools.

The optimization of sleep schedules has been proposed as a low cost way to improve educational outcomes. The afternoon learning improvement we observed for both memory tasks suggests that splitting sleep could be one such strategy to improve learning. The 90 min mid-afternoon sleep opportunity in the current study was chosen to maximize the probability of participants obtaining a full cycle of N2, SWS and REM sleep, but is toward the upper limits of nap durations that may be practical to implement in schools. Relatively short naps of 30–60 min have been shown to provide benefits to memory lasting up to a week.

Therefore future studies should examine whether splitting sleep with shorter nap opportunities provides similar benefits for cognition. Most prior work has examined the benefit of naps in relation to the consolidation of material learned before sleep, but there are several indications that the nap advantage we observed is the result of enhanced encoding, rather than consolidation. The blocks of the factual knowledge task provide a relatively pure measure of encoding capacity, because the incidental nature of the task restricts the use of mnemonic strategies, while only those trials when participants are paying attention and make the correct building/no-building judgment were analyzed. The improved afternoon encoding we observed for the split sleep group on this task also indirectly suggests that improved afternoon learning for the factual knowledge task was related to enhanced encoding, rather than consolidation.

This conclusion also seems likely given that the split sleep group obtained less nocturnal sleep in which to consolidate factual knowledge learned in the afternoon. As splitting sleep resulted in less TST over 24 h, it was surprising that this group had an afternoon memory advantage without any negative impact on information learned in the morning. Although the mechanism underlying this observation cannot be directly explained with the current design—where learning was spread over several days and learning sessions—we posit that the memory impairments, although we cannot entirely rule out this possibility.

For the factual knowledge task, vigilance did not differ between groups prior to retrieval. Moreover, we observed an interaction between memory for information learned in the morning and afternoon: if vigilance during retrieval was an influential factor then memory for all information should be equally affected, regardless of when it was learned. A significant limitation to broad generalization of our work may be that the sleep length in our split and continuous groups was below the 8–10 h recommended for adolescents. In the absence of a control group obtaining the recommended amount of sleep, we cannot determine the level of impairment associated with a sleep duration, or whether splitting sleep is also advantageous for individuals with habitual sleep length that is closer to the recommended amount. However, this sleep schedule provides an accurate reflection of sleep obtained by adolescents. J.N. Cousins et al.

undergoing habitual chronic sleep restriction in East Asia, and was terminated following a response, or after a 5000 ms time limit had elapsed, and was followed by a 1000 ms ITI. Images that were incorrectly judged to contain buildings or not were excluded from subsequent retrieval analysis, since these trials suggest that images were not adequately attended to. Consistent with prior work, analysis focused on two outcome measures: (1) confidence ratings of 4 (probably saw) and 5 (definitely saw) to old images were classed as “hits”, (2) confidence ratings of 4 and 5 to new images were “false alarms”. To correct for response bias toward old/new responses, the signal detection measure A′ was calculated using hits and false alarms, for which 0.5 represents chance performance.

Factual knowledge task—pretest

This was performed prior to learning in order to probe knowledge of the species to be learned. This involved four stages: (1) Picture Identification: participants were shown a single image and identified the animal shown from two options. This was repeated for each species. (2) General knowledge: 20 two-alternative forced choice questions regarding general characteristics of amphibians. (3) Specific knowledge: 20 two-alternative forced choice questions about information that they would encounter during the learning session, similar to questions encountered in the main test after learning. (4) Subjective disgust: participants rated the amount of disgust they felt toward each species (1 = no disgust, 9 = extreme disgust), to control for the influence of emotion on memory. (5) Subjective knowledge: participants rated their prior knowledge of each species (1 = no knowledge, 9 = extensive knowledge). All tests were self-paced and trials were presented in a random order.

METHODS

Factual knowledge task—encoding

Participants were informed that all information they were about to learn would be tested. They were shown example test questions using a species not featured in the learning and instructed to not discuss or peruse information about frogs/amphibians outside of the specified learning blocks.

Participants learned about three frogs (Poison Dart Frog, Flying Frog, Gray Tree Frog), 3 toads (Burrowing Toad, Yellow-bellied Toad, Cane Toad), three newts (Alpine Newt, Orange-bellied Newt, Great Crested Newt) and 3 salamanders (Giant Salamander, Green Salamander, Mud Puppy) in separate 30 min blocks. Characteristics (e.g., habitat) were adapted from their actual biology and behaviors.

Two participants withdrew from the study and those who remained (29 male, mean age = 16.6 ± 0.9) were matched into 2 groups: split sleep (n = 29) and continuous sleep (n = 29). The groups did not differ significantly in age, gender, consumption of caffeinated beverages, non-verbal intelligence, morning-eveningness preference, symptoms of chronic sleep reduction, levels of daytime sleepiness, subjective sleep quality, self-reported and actigraphically assessed sleep habits, or levels of anxiety and depression (p > 0.22; Table 1).

The study was approved by the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. The study was a registered clinical trial. All participants and legal guardians provided written informed consent.

Picture-encoding task

Stimuli were identical to those used in our prior study, consisting of 240 images depicting a variety of landscapes and building types, of which half featured buildings while the other half did not. These were split into three sets of 80 images (40 buildings, 40 no buildings). Two sets were presented during both encoding and retrieval (160 old images), while one set was presented only at retrieval (80 new images). The use of each set during encoding and retrieval was counterbalanced across participants.

Encoding took place in a single 15 min block. Participants were instructed to look carefully at each image and indicate whether it contained a building or not. They were not informed that their memory would be tested at a later date. Each image was presented for 2500 ms before a response screen was displayed showing “(1) Building, (2) No building”. After participants responded with the corresponding keypress, an inter-trial interval (ITI) of 1000 ms elapsed before the start of the next trial. The 160 images were presented in a randomized order.

Retrieval tested the recognition of 160 old images randomly intermixed with 80 new images. Images were presented above a five-point confidence scale: “(1) Definitely did not see, (2) Probably did not see, (3) Unsure, (4) Probably saw, (5) Definitely saw”. Participants were asked to indicate whether they remembered each image from the previous session. The trial questions and confidence ratings were displayed until a response was made.
