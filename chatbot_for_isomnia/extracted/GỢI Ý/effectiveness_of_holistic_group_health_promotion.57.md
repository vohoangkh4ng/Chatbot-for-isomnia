## Introduction
In today’s world of excellence, almost everyone experiences various degrees of stress in their daily lives. Even children are not an exception to it as they are experiencing greater stress on account of rising expectations at both school and home to perform beyond their natural ability. India accounts for 21% of adolescent population worldwide. Stress resulting from academic schedules though prevalent in adolescents worldwide seems to be more severe among their Asian counterparts. Asian students are pressured with high academic burden, suffer greater academic stress, have low satisfaction relating to their academic performance, and high expectations. Literature shows that academic pressure causes various mental and behavioral disorders such as depression, frustration, anxiety, helplessness, and suicidal behavior; these are more common emotional disorders in adolescents. School related factors that result in depression among adolescents are poor academic performance, stressful events at school, and negative feedback from teachers and parents.

As adolescent girls of today are mothers of tomorrow, their health is the foundation for future generations. They are more vulnerable to stress than adolescent boys because of the inherent physiological changes, their social upbringing, and a feeling of greater pressure to achieve good academic grades at an early age. Rentala, et al.: Effectiveness of holistic group health promotion program on educational stress, anxiety, and depression among adolescent girls

Although anxiety and depression affect boys and girls almost similarly, the adolescent girls are much more vulnerable. Recently, subjective stress related mental health complaints such as pain, sleeping problems, and anxiety have increased among older adolescents, especially girls. Depression is more common among adolescent girls. Previous literature has revealed that there is high prevalence of depression, suicidal attempts, anxiety, and stress related symptoms among adolescent girls when compared to boys, which affects the girls health status and accomplishments. Poor psychological health can have several effects on adolescent girls such as poor eating habits, physical health, and coping skills. It also leads to school dropout, drug dependence, unprotected sex, and adolescent pregnancy. This advocates the need for early and effective identification of depression, stress, and anxiety, which can prevent many psychiatric disorders at their nascent stage. The implementation of stress management strategies such as deep breathing, progressive muscular relaxation, positive self talk, etc., at this stage are not only relevant to manage stress at a very young age but also very significant in improving school achievement and emotional well-being among adolescents. Although school programs targeting stress management are effective in reducing stress among children, only a few are available specifically for adolescent girls.

Background of the Study

As stress can affect health, emotional state, and academic performance, it is important that students develop effective strategies to manage stressful situations. A systematic review revealed that holistic mental health promotion programs conducted by involving family members, school faculties, and community members result in not only an improvement in their mental health but also the social, academic, work performance, and general health components. These programs provide the adolescents with important life skills, help in achieving their full potential, and overcome difficulties. Such integrative programs deal with multiple student behavioral problems and effectively reduce the burden on schools and teachers. Present day adolescents need psychological treatment that goes beyond teaching or talk therapy. These holistic stress management interventions devote on wellness of body, mind, and spirit. Adolescents thrive with a holistic approach to care that not only focuses on individual symptoms or behavior but also on their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs equally. Evidence suggests that conventional stress management that focuses on stress symptoms is of very little benefit as the integrated approach is more ideal to treat the underlying causes of emotional distress. Although there is lot of literature on stress related studies, academic stress, stress adjustment problems, and need for guidance and counseling, management of stress for the students is not addressed sufficiently, especially in India. It is known that earlier the adolescents learn to deal with their stress, the better will be their psychological and physical health as an adult. Several socio-demographic data sheet, personality inventory, IQ assessment, and other self-report methods were used to assess the participants for baseline data. # Effectiveness of holistic group health promotion program on educational stress, anxiety, and depression among adolescent girls

## Measures

The subjects responded to the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS‑21) and Education Stress Scale for Adolescents (ESSA). The outcome measures were assessed at baseline (T0) and at three follow‑up assessments in the 1st (T1), 2nd (T2), and 3rd (T3) months.

1. **Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS‑21)** was developed by Lovibond, S.H.; Lovibond, P.F. in 1995. It is a short version of a 42‑item self‑report instrument consisting of three 7‑item subscales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. Each scale includes seven items, with a total of 21 items rated on a 4‑point scale ranging from 0–3 (0-denoting did not apply to me at all and 3-denoting applied to me most of the time). The overall scores for the three subscales are calculated as the sum of scores for the relevant seven items multiplied by two. The Cronbach’s alpha for stress subscale is 0.77, depression is 0.77, and anxiety is 0.80 among adolescents.

2. **Education Stress Scale for Adolescents (2011)** (ESSA) was developed by Sun, Dunne, Hou, and Xu. It is a self‑report instrument containing 16 items designed to measure educational stress on five components that include study pressure (4 items), workload (3 items), worry on grades (3 items), self expectation (3 items), and despondency (3 items) rated on a 5‑point scale from 1 to 5 (1‑strongly disagree to 5‑strongly agree) with higher score indicating greater educational stress. Scores range from 16 to 80. The Cronbach’s alpha for ESSA five subscales were 0.81, 0.74, 0.71, 0.66, and 0.75, indicating moderate to good internal consistency among East Asian adolescents.

## Intervention development

The content validity of the intervention module was ensured by a panel of eight subject experts. The appropriateness of each session for use among adolescent girls was rated by the panel members. Their recommendations relating to theme drawing and topics for group discussion were incorporated to better suit the needs of the participants.

## Data analysis

Data were analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences software package (Version 23), and results were presented in a table form. Baseline characteristics of the experimental and control groups were analyzed.

groups were compared using one-way ANOVA or independent t tests or χ2 test. The changes in the outcome variables from baseline to 3-month follow-up were compared using two-way RM-ANOVA.

## Results

### Pre-intervention comparison
At pre-intervention level, there were no statistically significant differences between experimental and control group subjects in all baseline variables such as age, residence, religion, type of family, number of siblings, birth order, family income, type of college, percentage of marks in previous class, number of homeworks, study hours per day, percentage of IQ, and type of personality. Both the groups were similar in all the outcome variables.

### Intervention effects
Two-way repeated measures ANOVA were conducted to know the variation in the outcome variables from baseline to 3-month follow-up. There were significant holistic group health promotion intervention effects in all the outcome variables between the experimental and control group subjects. Compared to the control group, the experimental group showed statistically significant decrease in educational stress (F = 500.90, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.90), depression (F = 222.73, P < 0.001, # Effectiveness of holistic group health promotion program on educational stress, anxiety, and depression among adolescent girls

The effect size of the holistic group health promotion intervention effects was consistently large for all the outcome variables in experimental group subjects compared to control group subjects.

## Discussion

On the whole, subjects in experimental group showed a marked decreased in educational stress, depression, anxiety, and stress in 3 months follow‑up compared to control group which did not receive any intervention. The follow‑up results indicated that the effect continued and persisted even after 3 months. This justifies the integration of holistic stress management program for adolescent girls within the school setting to effectively reduce stress levels. These findings are similar to previous research results, which highlighted that providing mind‑body interventions or mindfulness interventions on adolescents at school setting significantly reduced anxiety, depression, and stress. This study provides research evidence for group based holistic health promotion intervention among adolescent girls. # Effectiveness of holistic group health promotion program on educational stress, anxiety, and depression among adolescent girls

facilitates wider scope for primary care providers to implement these kinds of interventions in school settings. The present study results demonstrate that spirituality based holistic intervention is an effective approach in bringing down negative emotions among adolescent girls. In the present study, educational stress decreased considerably among experimental group subjects than in control group subjects at 3 months follow‑up (F = 500.9, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.90). This reduction suggests that practicing various health promotion activities may result in decreased negative emotions. Holistic interventions not only help in dealing with the present difficulties but also aim to care for the self balancing abilities of individuals. The present study findings were supported by previous studies which highlighted that holding stress management programs reduce academic stress and improve mental health of the adolescents. The unresolved stress may cause depression, eating disorders, somatic symptoms, suicidal behavior, anxiety, poor concentration, physical illness, substance abuse, and dissociative disorders. Present study showed that depression scores statistically decreased with a large effect size among experimental group subjects compared to control group subjects. This reduction continued for 3 months, demonstrating that group based holistic approach can facilitate positive emotions among adolescent girls. The present study results are consistent with previous literature where mindfulness based school programs reported lower depressive scores and stress among students. The anxiety levels of the experimental subjects exhibited a significant decrease in 3 month follow‑up compared to control group subjects. These results were in line with findings of previous studies on adolescents where spirituality oriented stress programs reduced anxiety and stress symptoms. It proved to be highly efficient as it was conducted in groups with less cost and was well accepted.

As this study was carried out with a small sample, there is a need to substantiate the research results with an adequate sample size. Self-reporting measures were used to assess outcome variables. Including objective measures in the future will strengthen the study validity. Notwithstanding these limitations, it is a maiden study to demonstrate the effectiveness of holistic group health promotion intervention integrating spirituality component in improving outcomes among Indian adolescent girls who are educationally stressed.

The present study findings have several implications for primary health care providers, school counsellors, parents, teachers, and several other stakeholders. Primary health care providers are in better position to implement these interventions, which include mindful meditation, simple relaxation exercises, mirror therapy, and self love techniques to reduce academic stress and anxiety among adolescents.

### Conclusion

Findings demonstrated effectiveness of holistic group health promotion intervention in decreasing the educational stress, depression, anxiety, and stress among educationally stressed adolescent girls. This improvement sustained for 3 months. The present study may provide an avenue for primary health care providers to implement holistic based stress management program so as to promote adolescent mental health in Indian context.
