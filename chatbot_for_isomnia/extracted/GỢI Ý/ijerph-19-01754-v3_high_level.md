# Title: Traditional East Asian Herbal Medicine for Post-Stroke Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials

## Summary: This article presents a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of traditional East Asian herbal medicine (HM) for managing post-stroke insomnia (PSI). The study highlights the prevalence of PSI as a significant complication following a stroke, with current psychotropic drug treatments showing limited effectiveness and potential adverse effects. The review analyzed 24 randomized controlled trials involving 1942 participants, finding that HM significantly improved sleep quality and was generally safer than psychotropic medications, although the quality of the included studies was rated as low to moderate. The authors conclude that while HM may offer potential benefits for treating PSI, further well-designed trials are necessary to strengthen the clinical evidence.
