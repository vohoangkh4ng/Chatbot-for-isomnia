# Title: The Teensleep study: the effectiveness of a school-based sleep education programme at improving early adolescent sleep

## Summary: This article evaluates the impact of the Teensleep program, a school-based sleep education initiative aimed at improving sleep knowledge and quality among adolescents. The study involved 1504 Year 10 students from ten UK secondary schools and assessed changes in sleep knowledge, quality, hygiene, and daytime sleepiness before and after the intervention. Results indicated significant improvements in sleep knowledge, with modest changes in sleep quality and hygiene. The findings suggest that while the program effectively enhances sleep knowledge, the direct benefits on sleep patterns were limited, particularly for those with initially poor sleep. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of such educational interventions on adolescent sleep health.
