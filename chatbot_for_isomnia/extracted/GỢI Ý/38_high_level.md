# Title: The short-term and long-term adverse effects of melatonin treatment in children and adolescents: a systematic review and GRADE assessment

## Summary: This article systematically reviews the short-term and long-term adverse effects of melatonin treatment in children and adolescents with chronic insomnia. It aims to inform clinicians and guideline panels about the potential serious and non-serious adverse events associated with melatonin use, as well as its impact on pubertal development and bone health. The review includes data from 22 randomized studies and 4 observational studies, indicating that while melatonin is not linked to serious adverse events, there is an increased risk of non-serious adverse events. The findings highlight the need for further research to better understand the safety and long-term consequences of melatonin use in this population.
