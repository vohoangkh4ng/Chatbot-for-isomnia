# Title: Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia in adolescents with comorbid psychiatric disorders: A clinical pilot study

## Summary: This study evaluates the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in adolescents suffering from insomnia and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Conducted as a non-controlled clinical pilot study with 23 participants, the research found significant improvements in insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and associated psychiatric symptoms following the intervention. Results indicate that CBT-I can be beneficial in a clinical setting, although the authors caution that the findings should be interpreted carefully due to the study's uncontrolled nature and small sample size, highlighting the need for larger, well-powered clinical trials to confirm these effects.
