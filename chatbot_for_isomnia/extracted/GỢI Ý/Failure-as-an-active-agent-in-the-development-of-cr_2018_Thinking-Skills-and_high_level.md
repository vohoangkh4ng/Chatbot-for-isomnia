# Title: Failure as an active agent in the development of creative and inventive mindsets

## Summary: This study investigates how high school student inventors conceptualize failure and learning from failure within the context of invention. Utilizing a 14-year-old grants program for young inventors, the research reveals that students view creative failure as an integral part of the inventing process rather than a final setback. Through discourse analysis, the study highlights students' preference for framing creative failure in terms of "high points" and "low points," suggesting a productive approach to learning. The findings contribute to understanding how notions of creative failure can be applied across various disciplines, emphasizing the importance of failure as a learning opportunity in the invention process.
