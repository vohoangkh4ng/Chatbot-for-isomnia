# Title: Aerobic exercise affects sleep, psychological wellbeing and immune system parameters among subjects with chronic primary insomnia

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of aerobic exercise training on sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, and immune system parameters in individuals with chronic primary insomnia. Eighty previously sedentary participants aged 35-56 were divided into an aerobic exercise intervention group and a control group. After six months, significant improvements were observed in sleep duration, efficiency, and psychological measures in the exercise group, while the control group showed no significant changes. The findings suggest that exercise can serve as an effective non-pharmacological treatment for enhancing sleep quality and overall wellbeing in those suffering from chronic primary insomnia.
