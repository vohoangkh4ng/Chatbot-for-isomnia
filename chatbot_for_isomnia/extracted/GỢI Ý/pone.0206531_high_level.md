# Title: The music that helps people sleep and the reasons they believe it works: A mixed methods analysis of online survey reports

## Summary: This article investigates the use of music as a sleep aid among the general public through a mixed methods online survey involving 651 participants. The study reveals that 62% of respondents use music to help them sleep, identifying fourteen musical genres and 545 artists. Key findings indicate that stress, age, and music use significantly predict sleep quality. Thematic analysis of open responses highlights four main reasons people believe music aids sleep: it provides unique properties that stimulate sleep, is part of a normal sleep routine, induces conducive physical or mental states, and distracts from disruptive stimuli. The research underscores the complex relationship between music and sleep, emphasizing individual preferences and diverse reasons for music's effectiveness in promoting better sleep.
