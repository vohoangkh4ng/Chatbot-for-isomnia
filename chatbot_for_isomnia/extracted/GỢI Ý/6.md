# Abstract

**Study Objectives:** We compared the basic cognitive functions of adolescents undergoing split (nocturnal sleep + daytime nap) and continuous nocturnal sleep schedules when total sleep opportunity was either below or within the recommended range (i.e. 6.5 or 8 h).

**Methods:** Adolescent participants (age: 15–19 year) in the 8-h split (n = 24) and continuous (n = 29) sleep groups were compared with 6.5-h split and continuous sleep groups from a previous study (n = 58). These protocols involved two baseline nights (9-h time-in-bed [TIB]), 5 nights of sleep manipulation, 2 recovery nights (9-h TIB), followed by a second cycle of sleep manipulation (3 nights) and recovery (2 nights). Cognitive performance, subjective sleepiness, and mood were evaluated daily; sleep was assessed using polysomnography.

**Results:** Splitting 6.5 h of sleep with a mid-afternoon nap offered a boost to cognitive function compared to continuous nocturnal sleep. However, when total TIB across 24 h increased to 8 h, the split and continuous sleep groups performed comparably in tests evaluating vigilance, working memory, executive function, processing speed, subjective sleepiness, and mood.

**Conclusions:** In adolescents, the effects of split sleep on basic cognitive functions vary by the amount of total sleep obtained. As long as the total sleep opportunity across 24 h is within the recommended range, students may fulfill sleep requirements by adopting a split sleep schedule consisting of a shorter period of nocturnal sleep combined with a mid-afternoon nap, without significant impact on basic cognitive functions.

## Statement of Significance
Splitting sleep into main nocturnal period and a daytime nap has been shown to mitigate deterioration in adolescents’ basic cognitive functions when total sleep opportunity over 24 h is less than recommended (i.e. 6.5 h). With total sleep opportunity at 8 h—the minimum recommended, we found that a split sleep schedule with 6.5-h nocturnal sleep and a 1.5-h nap achieved similar performance in basic cognitive tasks, subjective alertness, and mood as the nocturnal sleep only schedule. Our findings suggest that adopting a split sleep schedule in this manner may be a plausible option for adolescents unable to obtain sufficient sleep at night.

**Key words:** adolescents; cognition; naps; continuous sleep; split sleep; vigilance ## Introduction

Sleep curtailment in adolescents is a problem for many societies, but is particularly challenging in societies with highly competitive school environments. In Singapore, 85% of students report sleeping less than the recommended 8–10 h a night. In such societies, later bedtimes arise not only from the maturational delay in circadian rhythms and slower build-up of homeostatic sleep pressure, but also a perceived need to study longer and later into the night. More than 60% of teens in such societies go to bed after midnight on school nights. Late bedtimes, together with resistance to altering early school start times, significantly curtail the amount of nocturnal sleep a student can obtain. While sleeping the recommended nocturnal duration may still be best, a pragmatic remedy to afford satisfactory total sleep duration in societies with entrenched cultural beliefs is to adopt a split sleep schedule where an acceptable total duration of sleep is split into a shorter nocturnal sleep period combined with a mid-afternoon nap.

In our previous study examining the neurocognitive impact of split sleep schedules across two successive weeks, we found that the group that split a restricted total sleep opportunity of 6.5 h in 24 h into a 5-h nocturnal period combined with a 1.5-h mid-afternoon nap were markedly more vigilant compared to the group who had all of their sleep allocated to night time. This benefit on vigilance may be attributed to having two opportunities to dissipate homeostatic sleep pressure over 24 h. Prior work on adults suggests that when provision for total sleep time (TST) is adequate, for example, 9–10 h of time-in-bed (TIB), apportioning this into two equal periods across 24–28 h does not influence daytime cognitive performance. It is however, an open question whether the cognitive benefits of splitting sleep with a daytime nap would still be observed when total sleep opportunity across 24 h lies within the recommended nocturnal sleep duration for adolescents.

To address this, the present study sought to characterize basic neurocognitive functions of split versus continuous sleep schedules in adolescents wherein total sleep opportunity is 8 h, that is, the minimum amount of sleep recommended for this age group. We compared these 8 h sleep opportunity groups (8-h TIB at night vs. 6.5-h TIB at night plus 1.5-h nap opportunity) to the 6.5 h sleep opportunity groups from our previous study.

The four groups did not differ significantly in the following measures assessed during screening: age, sex, BMI, daily caffeine intake, morningness-eveningness preference, symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, symptoms of chronic sleep reduction, self-reported sleep, and actigraphically assessed sleep parameters.

During the week prior to the experiment, participants refrained from napping and adhered to a 9-h nocturnal sleep schedule (11:00 pm–08:00 am) in order to minimize the effects of prior sleep loss and to facilitate circadian entrainment. Compliance was verified with actigraphy.

## Study protocol

NFS5 was a 15-day experiment that was held during school vacation time at a student dormitory. Details of living arrangements have been reported in previously published work. On the first two nights of the protocol, all participants had a 9-h nocturnal sleep opportunity (11:00 pm–08:00 am) for adaptation and baseline characterization. This was followed by two cycles of sleep manipulation (continuous or split sleep) and recovery nights. The first cycle began with five nights of manipulation and ended with two nights of 9-h recovery sleep opportunity, simulating a typical school week. This was followed by the second cycle which included three manipulation nights and two recovery nights. This mimicked the recurrent pattern of restricted sleep on school nights and recovery sleep on weekends in a school term. During the manipulation periods, the continuous sleep group had 8-h TIB at night (11:30 pm–07:30 am), while the split sleep group had 6.5-h TIB at night followed by a 1.5-h nap opportunity in the mid-afternoon the next day.

A total of 59 adolescents (29 males) were recruited into the fifth Need for Sleep study (NFS5)—a series of experimental studies that aim at characterizing adolescents’ cognitive functions under different sleep manipulations. Participants were selected from a pool of 121 volunteers, following inclusion criteria used in four previous NFS studies. Adolescents were eligible if they were between 15 and 19 years of age, reported no known health conditions or sleep disorders, had a body mass index (BMI) of ≤30, consumed ≤5 cups of caffeinated beverages per day, were not habitual short sleepers, and did not travel across >2 time zones in the month prior to the experiment.

Cognitive performance was assessed with a computerized test battery administered three times daily (except on the first and final days): at 10:00 am, 4:15 pm, and 8:00 pm. Table 1. Characteristics of all split and continuous sleep groups

P-values from the ANOVA and chi-squared tests contrasting the four groups are listed. Characteristics of the 6.5-h total TIB groups were obtained from a previous study.

Figure 1. Protocol. In this 15-day protocol, both the 8-h split sleep group and the 8-h split continuous group had two adaptation and baseline nights (B 1 and B ; TIB indicated by black bars = 9 h from 11:00 pm to 08:00 am). The first cycle of sleep opportunity manipulation lasted 5 nights (M1–M1) followed by two nights of recovery sleep (R11 and R1; TIB = 9 h). The second cycle consisted of three manipulation nights (M2 1 –M2) and two recovery nights (R21 and R2). During the two sleep opportunity manipulation periods, the split sleep group had a nocturnal TIB of 6.5 h (00:15 am–06:45 am) and a 1.5-h nap opportunity between 2:00 pm and 3:30 pm, while the continuous sleep group had a nocturnal TIB of 8 h (11:30 pm–07:30 am). Asterisks indicate nocturnal sleep and daytime nap episodes with polysomnographic recordings. A cognitive test battery was administered at 10:00 am, 4:15 pm, and 8:00 pm daily, except during the first and last days of the protocol.

There was no significant difference in any of the PSG parameters during the baseline night among all four groups of participants (p > 0.10; Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, even when we restricted our analyses to the 8-h continuous and the 8-h split sleep groups, no significant group difference was observed in TST, the durations of N1, N2, N3, and REM sleep (p > 0.07; Figure 2), and N2 sleep latency (p = 0.15; Figure 3, A). At baseline, no significant difference was found between the 8-h continuous and the 8-h split sleep groups in any of the PSG-assessed sleep parameters, including TST, the durations of N1, N2, N3, and REM sleep (p > 0.07; Figure 2), and N2 sleep latency (p = 0.15; Figure 3, A).

In the first 24 h of both sleep manipulation periods, out of their total TIB of 8 h, both groups had a similar total daily TST. | Sleep Condition                | Total Sleep Time (TST) | N2 Sleep Duration | N3 Sleep Duration | REM Sleep Duration |

With a total TIB of 8 h provisioned, vigilance performance of the split and the continuous sleep groups did not differ significantly throughout the protocol (8-h split vs. 8-h continuous sleep: p > 0.19). A group × day interaction in the daily average PVT lapse count was statistically significant (F = 2.62, p < 0.001). This was attributed to the greater number of PVT lapses in the | Sleep Condition                | N2 Sleep Latency | SWA in First Hour |

continuous sleep group relative to the split sleep group when a split sleep schedule appeared to confer more total TIB was restricted to 6.5 h (6.5-h split vs. 6.5-h continuous sleep: p < 0.02 from day M1). Also, PVT performance remained relatively stable for the two groups with a total TIB of 8 h per 24 h. In contrast, compounded effects of two sleep restriction periods on vigilance was observed in both the 6.5-h split and the 6.5-h continuous sleep groups.

Similar patterns were observed when PVT performance was considered for each time of day. In the morning, the number of PVT lapses was reduced on most days in the first sleep restriction and recovery cycle for the 6.5-h split sleep group relative to the 6.5-h continuous sleep group. In contrast, no significant contrast was found for the two 8-h groups. Prior to their nap on M2, the 8-h split sleep group was found to have a small increase in the number of PVT lapses from baseline (4.83 ± 1.92, p = 0.01), whereas the 8-h continuous sleep group’s morning vigilance was at baseline level during the entire study (p > 0.09).

In the afternoon and evening, compared to sleeping the 6.5 h continuously, splitting sleep with a mid-afternoon nap led to reduction in the number of PVT lapses. However, when total TIB was 8 h, the split and the continuous sleep schedules resulted in similar levels of vigilance performance at these two times of day. In the afternoon, PVT performance of the 8-h split sleep group was at the baseline level throughout the protocol (p > 0.06), and the number of PVT lapses was only slightly elevated from baseline on some days in the 8-h continuous sleep group.

Our sleep opportunity manipulations did not have any statistically significant impact on PANAS negative scores.

### Discussion
We split an 8-h total sleep opportunity over 24 h to allow for a 1.5-h nap in the afternoon to supplement a shortened nocturnal Daily average sleep opportunity of 6.5 h, and found that this split sleep schedule yielded comparable cognitive performance, subjective sleepiness, and mood as when adolescents slept the entire allocated sleep opportunity at night. The findings held up over multiple nights on this schedule and suggest that when the total sleep opportunity across 24 h is within the recommended range, scheduling part of the total sleep opportunity for an afternoon nap may have little impact on neurobehavioral functions. This offers a practical solution to students who are unable to obtain the full sleep recommendation at night wherein a mid-afternoon nap can be utilized to fulfill sleep requirements without significant costs to basic cognitive functions, alertness, and mood. The present work, the first examining split sleep schedules in adolescents with total sleep duration in the recommended range, converges with findings from studies performed in adults in laboratory settings showing that splitting at least 8-h TIB into two opportunities yielded similar vigilance outcomes compared to continuous sleep. This pattern was consistent across variations in how much sleep was allocated between the two opportunities—while our present study examined a longer nocturnal period with a 1.5-h day time nap, other studies have split the recommended amount of sleep into two opportunities of equal duration, and one examined several combinations of a longer anchor nocturnal period plus a nap ranging from 0.4-h to 2.4-h. These findings suggest that when adolescents and adults obtain at least the minimum recommended TIB, how sleep is apportioned across 24 h may not impact basic neurobehavioral functions relative to sleeping the equivalent amount continuously at night. Nevertheless, future work in adolescents should aim to contrast different allocations of sleep within the two opportunities to examine if splitting adolescents’ sleep in different ways would continue to be comparable to a continuous sleep schedule.

Notably, the pattern found in adolescents diverges from that of adults when total sleep opportunity falls below the recommended range. While our adolescent findings suggest that splitting sleep into a nocturnal period and mid-day nap preferentially boosts cognitive function for sleep restricted adolescents, in adults, a study reported that splitting any amount of sleep up, including durations as short as 6 h, does not affect daytime vigilance differently compared to a consolidated sleep period of the same total amount. Whereas in adults it appears that vigilance is a function of the total time in bed per 24 h independent of how sleep is distributed, our studies suggest that in adolescents, there are differential effects of splitting sleep that vary by the amount of total sleep obtained. This difference under conditions of sleep restriction may reflect ongoing maturation of brain systems governing arousal and cognitive processes in adolescence. Compared to adults, adolescents’ lapses in the PVT are shown averaged across the three tests each day, and separately for tests taken in the morning, afternoon, and evening. PVT results are plotted after the last baseline night, during the first cycle of sleep opportunity manipulation and after recovery nights, to the second cycle of sleep manipulation and recovery sleep. Observations for the 8-h split sleep group are shown in red open circles and dotted lines, while those for the 8-h continuous sleep group are illustrated in red filled circles and solid lines. For comparison, performance in a 6.5-h split sleep group and a 6.5-h continuous sleep group from a previous study are also presented. The least square means and standard errors estimated with general linear mixed models are plotted. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, and *p < 0.05 for significant contrasts between the split and the continuous sleep groups. |   |   SLEEPJ, 2020, Vol. 43, No. 12 |

vigilance, memory performance does not always show consistent deficits under adolescent sleep restriction protocols. For example, Voderholzer et al. found that restricting nocturnal sleep to 5 h for four consecutive nights had no impact on adolescents’ declarative and procedural memory consolidation. In addition, in our previous study, we found that even though the split sleep group (5 h nocturnal + 1.5 h nap) experienced a relative dip in vigilance in the morning, they were still able to effectively learn biology facts at that time, suggesting a potential dissociation in the effects of split sleep on tests measuring basic cognitive processes compared to those involving higher order cognitive functions that may be more interesting and cognitively engaging, and hence, less sensitive to momentary drop outs in performance. Interestingly, studies in undergraduates have also found that even after a normal night of 7–9 h TIB, a midday nap can still confer benefits on long-term memory. It thus appears that split sleep schedules, even without sleep restriction could still have a facilitative effect on memory.

The present study sheds light on the implications of splitting sleep on sleep architecture. Notably, split sleep schedules did not shorten the total amount of N2 and N3 obtained, as the naps that comprised mainly N2 and N3 sleep filled in for the shortened duration of these stages at night. However, these daytime naps consisted of a small amount of REM sleep and which did not offset the loss of nocturnal REM sleep due to earlier wake times in the split sleep group (06:45 am vs. 07:30 am). The 8-h split sleep group obtained 12–18 min less REM compared to the 8-h continuous sleep group. This said, we did not find group differences in basic cognitive performance, sleepiness, or mood, suggesting that the decreased REM duration may not be severe enough to affect these functions. Lastly, we found that a 1.5-h afternoon nap reduced SWA in the first hour of the subsequent nocturnal sleep episode, indicating that the daytime nap was effective in dissipating the homeostatic sleep pressure that built up with 6.5 h TIB at night. This could have contributed to the relatively stable vigilance performance of the split sleep group throughout the protocol.

Although it has been suggested that individuals who report napping regularly and those who do not may differ in their ability to nap, we found that all our adolescent participants were able to nap (minimum TST across all nap episodes = 32 min) regardless of whether or not they did so on a regular basis. Based on sleep diaries collected during the screening week, only 44% of those in the 8-h split sleep group reported taking a daytime nap at least once within the week. Yet, all were able to effectively utilize the 90-min nap opportunity regularly provided across a 15-day period, falling asleep within an average of 12.3 min and achieving an average sleep efficiency of 83.9%. While napping appeared to increase nocturnal sleep latency on some nights likely as a result of reduced sleep pressure on those nights, this effect was inconsistent across the manipulation period (significant only on M1 3), and was most pronounced on the first recovery nights following manipulation (R1 1 and R2) in which the split sleep group had an earlier bedtime (11:00 pm vs. 00:15 am) in addition to a daytime nap. Overall, these findings suggest that the prevalence of habitual napping in adolescents may be related to opportunity as opposed to ability, and support the feasibility of implementing midday naps in schools as a strategy to boost sleep health and neurobehavioral functions.

Limitations
The present study only examined splitting sleep between a long nocturnal period and a 1.5-h daytime nap. As such, the present conclusions cannot be generalized to other forms of splitting sleep. It is possible that patterns of cognitive functions, subjective sleepiness, and mood measured across the day will differ when nocturnal sleep is reduced to <5 h TIB, for example, when sleep is split into two equal periods (4 h + 4 h). Additionally, the nap opportunity used in our study might have been relatively long to be practicable (Table 1). Future studies may seek to evaluate additional combinations of split sleep schedules.

Adolescents are recommended to sleep 8–10 h each night. Although we used the minimum recommended sleep duration in this study, we cannot preclude the possibility that this TIB was not sufficient for some of our participants. Future studies should examine if our findings will replicate with a 10-h TIB per 24 h.

The present work did not include measures of glucose metabolism. While our previous study found a greater increase in blood glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test in the split sleep group (5-h nocturnal TIB + 1.5-h nap) compared to the continuous sleep group (6.5-h TIB at night), the metabolic outcomes of splitting sleep durations within the recommended range remain unknown.

In order to compare the present study to previous protocols and not to over-test participants, we sampled performance on the test battery three times across the day. This limited the ability to assess performance on a finer time scale, and in particular immediately before the nap when homeostatic sleep pressure would be higher in the split sleep group.

Lastly, as the present work contrasted groups of students in the same age range selected one year apart, there may be potential cohort effects. Nonetheless, participants in the NFS4 and NFS5 studies were matched on all relevant demographic variables as well as sleep habits assessed during screening.

Conclusions
In adolescents, we found that there are differential effects of splitting sleep on basic cognitive functions, alertness, and mood that depend the total sleep opportunity. These findings suggest that as long as the total duration of sleep obtained across 24 h is satisfactory, many students may be able to adopt a split sleep schedule incorporating a mid-afternoon nap combined with a shorter period of nocturnal sleep. This work adds to the growing literature on practical strategies that may be employed to boost sleep health in modern societies.
