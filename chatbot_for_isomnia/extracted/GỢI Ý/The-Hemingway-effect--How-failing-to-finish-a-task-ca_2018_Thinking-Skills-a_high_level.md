# Title: The Hemingway effect: How failing to finish a task can have a positive effect on motivation

## Summary: This study investigates the "Hemingway effect," which posits that individuals may feel more motivated to complete a task they previously failed to finish, particularly when they perceive they were close to completion. Two studies were conducted: the first involved undergraduate students who were interrupted while copying text, revealing that those with less remaining text reported higher motivation to continue. The second study focused on structured versus unstructured writing tasks, finding that the Hemingway effect was present only in the structured condition. The findings suggest that under certain circumstances, failure to complete a task can enhance motivation to persist, with implications for educational practices.
