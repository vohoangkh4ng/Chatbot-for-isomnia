# Title: How Many Sleep Diary Entries Are Needed to Reliably Estimate Adolescent Sleep?

## Summary: This article investigates the number of nights of sleep diary entries required to reliably estimate various sleep-related outcomes in adolescents, including bedtime, wake time, sleep onset latency, sleep duration, and wake after sleep onset. The study analyzes data from multiple adolescent samples across different countries and finds that at least five weekday nights of sleep diary entries are necessary for reliable estimates of bedtime, sleep onset latency, and sleep duration. The research also confirms the stability of adolescent sleep patterns over a 12-week period, highlighting the importance of reliable sleep assessments in understanding sleep behaviors and their implications for health and cognitive functioning.
