# Title: Does splitting sleep improve long-term memory in chronically sleep deprived adolescents?

## Summary: This article investigates the effects of a split sleep schedule on long-term memory in adolescents who are chronically sleep deprived. The study compares two conditions: continuous nocturnal sleep and a split sleep schedule that includes a daytime nap. Results indicate that adolescents who experienced split sleep recognized more pictures and remembered more facts learned in the afternoon compared to those with continuous sleep, suggesting that a split sleep schedule may enhance learning without impairing morning memory retention. The findings highlight the potential benefits of napping for adolescents facing sleep restrictions.
