# Total sleep deprivation decreases saliva ghrelin levels in adolescents

## Summary
Ghrelin, a regulator of food intake and energy expenditure, has been shown to be associated with insufficient sleep. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of a single night of total sleep deprivation on fasting saliva ghrelin and on nocturnal variation of saliva ghrelin concentration. A further aim of the study was to investigate the influence of body mass index on changes in saliva ghrelin levels. Altogether 35 adolescents (18 boys; age: 13.8 ± 1.14 years) were studied on two subsequent days (sleep and total sleep deprivation). Saliva samples were collected during the two experimental nights at 21:00 hours, 01:00 hours and 06:00 hours. Total-ghrelin concentration showed a continuous increase from the evening until 06:00 hours. This increase was blunted significantly (p = 0.003) by total sleep deprivation. Total-ghrelin level was significantly lower (p = 0.02) during total sleep deprivation at 06:00 hours (median 403.6 pg ml1; 95% confidence interval: 343.1–468.9 pg ml1) as compared with values during the sleep condition (median 471.2 pg ml1; 95% confidence interval: 205.4–1578.7 pg ml1). Acyl-ghrelin levels did not present any change at the three time points, and were not affected by total sleep deprivation. Stratifying the study population according to body mass index (normal weight and overweight/obese groups), the blunting effect of total sleep deprivation was more pronounced in the obese/overweight group (sleep: median 428.2 pg ml1; 95% confidence interval: 331.3–606.9 pg ml1 versus total sleep deprivation: median 333.1 pg ml1; 95% confidence interval: 261.5–412.9 pg ml1; p = 0.0479). Saliva total-ghrelin concentrations gradually increased during the night, and total sleep deprivation significantly blunted this increase. This blunting effect was mainly observed in subjects with overweight/obesity. The physiological and clinical implications of the present observation are to be clarified by further studies.

Over the last century there has been a secular nightly decline of 0.75 min per year in children's sleep duration that resulted in 75 min daily decrease during 100 years. In parallel, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased. According to the report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity the global “prevalence of overweight among children under the age of five years has risen between 1990 and 2014, from 4.8% to 6.1% with numbers of affected children rising from 31 million to 41 million during that time.” There is strong evidence suggesting that short sleep duration is a risk factor for obesity in both children and adults. Insufficient sleep duration may influence weight gain through several possible behavioural and biological pathways, including alterations in appetite-regulating hormones (leptin, insulin, ghrelin).

Ghrelin, an orexigenic gut peptide, is produced mainly by the stomach and the gastrointestinal tract, and its secretion is modified by meals (increasing before a meal and decreasing thereafter). More recently, it has been discovered that ghrelin is produced and released by salivary glands in humans. A circadian variation was described in ghrelin secretion, with a zenith at 01:00 hours and nadir at 09:00 hours in plasma samples, and with a zenith at 03:00 hours and a nadir between 06:00 hours and 09:00 hours in saliva samples. Two major forms of ghrelin circulate in human plasma and saliva: acylated/active (approximately 5% of total-ghrelin); and des-acyl (95% of total-ghrelin).

A number of studies demonstrated associations of multiple sleep aspects, including insomnia, sleep pattern, sleep duration and ghrelin level. Decreased nocturnal circulating total-ghrelin levels were found in patients with chronic insomnia compared with healthy sleepers. Insufficient sleep was found to be associated with increased serum total-ghrelin levels in a randomized-controlled trial. Overall, the studies investigating the connection between qualitative and quantitative markers of sleep and plasma ghrelin levels find null, positive and negative relationships.

The findings regarding the direct effects of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on appetite-regulating hormones are also inconsistent. In a randomized and balanced crossover design observation, a higher circulating level of total-ghrelin was found after TSD in 16 healthy male subjects. Another experimental study demonstrated a blunted rise of circulating ghrelin levels during TSD. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has been published investigating the effect of TSD on ghrelin levels in adolescence, particularly not on saliva ghrelin levels.

Results of studies investigating the association between salivary ghrelin concentrations and body mass index (BMI) are contradictory. Only the study of Li et al. investigated children and adolescents.

Saliva is a clinically informative, biological fluid. The saliva sampling is advantageous to the patient, especially in childhood. It is a non-invasive, pain- and stress-free technique that thereby enables multiple samplings. However, research on saliva and its applications for the diagnosis of diseases is still in its early stages, so the clinical research analysing biomarkers, hormones or any other compound from saliva samples has great importance. Aydin et al. presented a study that suggested that measurement of ghrelin in saliva may be an acceptable alternative to plasma sampling. These results are consistent with the findings of Benedix et al. who found significantly higher fasting saliva total-ghrelin levels compared with fasting plasma ghrelin level. The plasma and saliva ghrelin levels significantly correlated in healthy individuals.

The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of a single night of TSD on fasting saliva ghrelin and on nocturnal variation of saliva ghrelin concentration. A further aim of the study was to investigate the influence of BMI on changes in saliva ghrelin levels and on nocturnal variation. Although no other study has been published investigating the effect of TSD on saliva ghrelin levels in adolescence, based on the experimental sleep deprivation in adults, we hypothesized that fasting saliva ghrelin level would be increased by 1 night of TSD.

# 2 SUBJECTS AND METHODS

## 2.1 Ethics statement

The study design and consent forms were approved by the Regional and Local Research Ethic Committee, University of Pécs. The procedures of the investigation were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and subsequent revisions. Written informed consent was obtained from one of the parents of the participants, and from the adolescents before inclusion.

## 2.2 Subjects

Originally 43 subjects participated in the study. Eight of them were excluded because of history of acute or chronic medical condition, current smoking, sleep problems during the examination, insufficient saliva sample volume. The study participants were recruited from two different groups. From the remaining 35 adolescents (age: 13.8 ± 1.14 years; BMI: 21.81 ± 3.8 kg m2; all non-smokers), 10 subjects were admitted to the ward for sleep deprivation electroencephalogram (EEG) test in order to exclude epilepsy. In these patients, the EEG was normal, and epilepsy or any underlying disease were excluded. The remaining 25 healthy subjects volunteered to participate in the study, and they were also admitted for 2 days just for the purpose of the study. General characteristics of the subjects are provided in Table 1. | Characteristic               | Boys                          | Girls          | All            | p-Value   |

2.3 | Study design and procedure

The study was performed using an experimental, within-subject design. The participants spent two consecutive nights at the Department of Paediatrics, Clinical Centre, University of Pécs, Hungary. All participants were studied under 1 night of the sleep condition followed by 1 night of the TSD condition. Determination of salivary ghrelin values has been suggested as a non-invasive alternative to plasma. Although saliva has a higher ghrelin concentration than that of plasma and the circadian variation is also different in the two biosamples, a significant linear correlation has been demonstrated between salivary and plasma ghrelin levels. During the two experimental nights, saliva samples were collected at 21:00 hours, 01:00 hours and 06:00 hours by using Salivettes. Immediately after collection, saliva samples were centrifuged at 2300 g at 4C for 15 min, and the supernatant was divided into aliquots and stored at 80C until analysis. During both sleep conditions, food and drink (except water) consumption were not allowed from 18:00 hours to 06:00 hours. Study participants should not have brushed their teeth within 1 hr of sample collection. During the TSD condition in order to ensure wakefulness, the participants could choose movies, games and books, but more than light physical activity was not allowed, and they were supervised by one of the researchers. We measured body weight to the nearest 0.1 kg and body fat percent to the nearest 0.1% on TANITA BC 418 MA Segmental Body Composition Analyzer. Height was measured on a Seca 225 telescopic stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres. For the definition of overweight and obesity we used national sex-specific BMI-for-age growth charts. The study participants were classified according to their BMI values: 1: normal weight—BMI 10th–90th percentile; 2: overweight and obese—BMI > 90th percentile. We choose the BMI classification instead of body fat as no national (Hungarian) or internationally accepted standards exist for body fat percent measured by bioelectric impedance device. Food consumption and physical activity were recorded on the days before the examination nights. Daytime food intake was recorded by food intake diary; energy and macronutrient intake were calculated by a Hungarian software called NutriComp DietCAD, developed for dieticians and nutritionists, with a nutrition planning program, and having a comprehensive database of raw materials with nearly 1600 food contents and a wide range of nutrients. Thirty-one subjects produced valid food intake diaries (at least three meals recorded). Activity levels were measured continuously using waist-worn accelerometer-based monitors. The daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was calculated using Freedson's cut points. Twenty-six subjects produced valid physical activity data (at least 8 hr per day on both days).

2.4 | Measurement of salivary ghrelin concentration

The frozen saliva samples were defrosted, and acyl-ghrelin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) kits from DRG Diagnostics. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 9.5% and 13.7%. The assay sensitivity was 7.8 pg/ml, the specificity was 100% for human ghrelin, canine ghrelin and ghrelin 1-10, and < 0.1% for des-octanoylghrelin. There was no detectable cross-reaction in the case of ghrelin 14-28, motilin-related peptide, leptin, insulin, glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1. The saliva total-ghrelin concentrations were measured using RIA kits from DRG Diagnostics. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 10% and 14.7%, respectively. The assay sensitivity was 93.0 pg/ml, the specificity was 100% for human ghrelin, canine ghrelin, ghrelin 14-28 and des-octanoylghrelin. There was no detectable cross-reaction in the case of ghrelin 1-10, motilin-related peptide, leptin, insulin, glucagon and GLP-1.

2.5 | Data analysis

Shapiro–Wilk tests were performed to check normality of the acquired datasets. Wilcox test was used to compare the anthropometric parameters as well as the ghrelin levels (total and acyl) between boys and girls. Sleep condition and sleep deprivation condition were also compared with Wilcox test. Comparisons between confounder parameters (physical activity, energy, and macronutrient intake) and between the time points were compared by Wilcox test. Each time point measurement was averaged and plotted as a function of the time to draw the circadian chronograms. A 24-hr cosinor rhythmometry model was developed to obtain the best estimates of the overall acrophase, amplitude and mesor for ghrelin. Cosinor2 package from R was used to acquire. | Parameters of physical activity, energy and nutrient intake on the day before sleep and TSD condition | Sleep condition | TSD condition | p-Value |

The saliva total-ghrelin concentrations gradually increased during the night of the sleep condition. Total-ghrelin concentration was significantly higher at 01:00 hours than at 21:00 hours, and significantly higher at 06:00 hours than at 01:00 hours. The total- and acyl-ghrelin levels in the saliva during the sleep and TSD conditions are represented in Table 3. The nocturnal rise in total-ghrelin concentrations was perceptible during both sleep and sleep deprivation conditions. However, the amplitude of the increment was significantly lower during sleep deprivation. Total-ghrelin levels were significantly lower during TSD at 06:00 hours as compared with the sleep condition. Saliva acyl-ghrelin concentrations were not affected by TSD.

The study population was stratified by BMI into normal weight (NW; n = 22) and overweight/obese (OWO; n = 13) groups. Basal characteristics of the groups are shown in Table 4. There were no significant differences between either acyl- or total-ghrelin values of the two groups at any time. Total-ghrelin concentrations were significantly higher at night (01:00 hours) compared with evening (21:00 hours) only during sleep condition duration in both groups (NW: p < 0.001; OWO: p = 0.021). In the morning (06:00 hours), there were significantly. | Sleep condition median (95% CI) | TSD condition median (95% CI) | p-Value |

higher total-ghrelin concentrations than at night (21:00 hours) in both conditions and in both groups (T0: NW: p = 0.032; OWO: p = 0.044; T1: NW: p = 0.017; OWO: p = 0.007). Morning total-ghrelin concentrations were significantly higher also compared with evening total-ghrelin concentrations on both days and in both groups (T0: NW: p < 0.001; OWO: p < 0.001; T1: NW: p = 0.004; OWO: p = 0.01). The amplitude of the increment was significantly lower after TSD in the normal weight group (p = 0.048) and in the overweight/obese group (p = 0.003), too. However, the morning total-ghrelin level was significantly lower after TSD than after the sleep condition only in the overweight/obese group (p = 0.0479; Figure 2). Saliva acyl-ghrelin concentrations were affected neither by TSD nor by BMI stratification.

4 | DISCUSSION

The present study describes a nocturnal rhythm in saliva total-ghrelin levels in normal adolescents. The saliva total-ghrelin concentrations gradually increased during both nights. This nocturnal rhythm could not be observed in the case of acyl-ghrelin levels. Aydin et al. (2006) investigated the circadian variation of saliva total-ghrelin in 22 healthy adults. They found a circadian variation, with the highest concentration at 03:00 hours and with nadir at 06:00 hours. Cummings et al. (2001a) previously described circadian variation in plasma total-ghrelin in 10 healthy subjects. Plasma total-ghrelin levels reached a zenith at 01:00 hours, then gradually fell during the night to a nadir at 06:00 hours. However, there was a large inter-individual variability in the range of ghrelin values and heterogeneity in pre-breakfast surges. These findings are not in line with our findings; however, there were considerable differences between the studies in the age of the study population and in the timing of the last meal consumption, therefore it is difficult to compare the results. The subjects in the study of Aydin et al. (2006) had their last meal at 21:00 hours, while the subjects in the study of Cummings et al. (2001a) had dinner at 17:30 hours. These data do not permit to conclude whether the circadian changes in saliva ghrelin excretion are regulated by the biological clock or by food intake. In another experimental study, Natalucci et al. (2005) investigated the circadian rhythm of total-ghrelin levels during prolonged fasting. They found a striking increase in plasma total-ghrelin concentrations at four time points: at about 08:00 hours, between noon and 13:00 hours, and between 17:00 hours and 19:00 hours. According to the literature, it seems very likely that the circadian rhythm of total-ghrelin is influenced not just by the biological clock, but also by food intake and the timing of usual food intake. The examinations involving children could not demonstrate a significant association between insufficient sleep duration and plasma total-ghrelin levels. Another cross-sectional study involving teenaged participants found a negative association between active ghrelin and hours of sleep. There is more evidence about the connection of insufficient sleep and circulating ghrelin levels in the adult population. Most of the studies reported increased ghrelin levels after sleep deprivation. A study involving 1030 persons demonstrated a significant association between insufficient sleep duration and increased plasma total-ghrelin level. In an experimental examination, elevated daytime levels of plasma total-ghrelin were associated with 2 days of reduced sleep time (4 hr per night in bed). Another experimental study involving 19 healthy subjects demonstrated higher plasma total-ghrelin levels | Norma weight group (NW) | Overweight/obese group (OWO) |

F I G U R E 2 The effect of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on saliva ghrelin levels in normal weight (NW) and overweight/obese (OWO) subjects

The data are presented as mean ± SD

during sleep restriction (4.5 hr per night in bed) as compared with normal sleep. Opposite to these findings, significantly reduced fasting total-ghrelin level was demonstrated in subjects with insomnia.

Few studies investigated the association between TSD and ghrelin levels. These studies revealed elevated plasma total-ghrelin level after sleep deprivation. Contrary to the findings in adults, we found that a single night of TSD led to decreased fasting saliva total-ghrelin concentrations in adolescents. The reason for the difference between previous results and our present results can be due to the different age ranges and the difference in the biological fluid investigated (saliva versus plasma). According to previous papers, pubertal development influences fasting ghrelin level. The majority of the studies demonstrated decreasing ghrelin levels by age and pubertal development. The longitudinal study of Cheng et al. found a U-shaped association between plasma ghrelin levels, age and pubertal development. No data are available concerning the effect of puberty on salivary ghrelin levels.

We found that saliva total-ghrelin concentrations gradually increased during both nights. This nocturnal rhythm could not be observed in the case of acyl-ghrelin levels. Our findings are in line with the results of Dzaja et al. who presented a similar effect of sleep deprivation on plasma total-ghrelin levels.

The association between BMI and saliva ghrelin levels is still unclear. Abdalla and Choo found a positive correlation between fasting saliva total-ghrelin levels and BMI in 18–25-year-old young obese adult population. In contrast, the study by Aydin et al., involving 30 medical students, found a negative correlation between saliva total-ghrelin levels and BMI. Li et al. in a Chinese study investigating children and adolescents found significantly lower salivary and blood ghrelin levels in lean subjects compared with the other groups, but there were no differences between normal, overweight and obese groups. Our results support the findings of the latter study. The contradictory results concerning the association between BMI and salivary ghrelin can be attributed to the different age of the investigated population difference in BMI categories and in the time of the sampling.

The amplitude of the night increment was significantly lower after TSD in both normal and overweight/obese groups. Interestingly, the morning total-ghrelin level was significantly lower only in the overweight/obese group after TSD. According to our knowledge, there is no other study investigating the effect of sleep deprivation in normal and obese/overweight adolescents. The low ghrelin level after TSD may reduce hunger leading to breakfast skipping, which is especially characteristic of overweight/obese adolescents. Our hypothesis needs further confirmation.

Our study has several strengths. We included the investigation of possible confounding factors such as physical activity and food consumption. The study population is not a large sample but, compared with the other studies in this field, is one of the largest sample size. In addition, to the best of our knowledge there are no other publications investigating the nocturnal rhythm in saliva total- and active-ghrelin levels or the effect of TSD on total and active-ghrelin levels in adolescents. Notwithstanding these merits, the study has limitations also. Firstly, saliva samples were collected only three times per night, therefore we cannot provide information about daytime changes, but we wanted to exclude the effects of meal consumption. Secondly, the plasma ghrelin concentrations were not measured in parallel with saliva samples. Thirdly, at the beginning of the experiment there was no adaptation night.

CONCLUSIONS
- Saliva total-ghrelin concentration gradually increased during the night, and TSD significantly blunted this increase.
- Saliva total-ghrelin levels were significantly lower during TSD at 06:00 hours compared with those during the sleep condition.
- Overweight and obesity did not influence the saliva acyl- and total-ghrelin levels or their nocturnal rhythm; however, the inhibition of the morning rise of total-ghrelin was more pronounced in the overweight/obese subjects. The blunted morning rise of the total saliva ghrelin concentration in overweight and obese adolescents following TSD might be a factor that may partly explain the link between short sleep and breakfast skipping. Further studies are required to prove this hypothesis.
