# Title: Targeted Reactivation during Sleep Differentially Affects Negative Memories in Socially Anxious and Healthy Children and Adolescents

## Summary: This article investigates the role of memory reactivations during sleep in the long-term consolidation of both positive and negative memories in children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder (SAD) compared to healthy controls. The study found that while cueing during sleep facilitated retention of both types of memories, it led to a more negative perception of negative memories in SAD patients after one week. Additionally, increased EEG theta activity was observed in response to negative stimuli in SAD patients, suggesting that memory reactivation during sleep may contribute to the negative memory bias characteristic of SAD.
