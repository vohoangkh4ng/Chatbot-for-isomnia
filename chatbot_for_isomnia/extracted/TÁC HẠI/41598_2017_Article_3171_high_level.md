# Title: Irregular sleep/wake patterns are associated with poorer academic performance and delayed circadian timing

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between irregular sleep schedules, circadian timing, and academic performance among college students. By analyzing data from 61 undergraduates over 30 days, the researchers introduced a novel metric called the sleep regularity index (SRI) to quantify sleep regularity. The findings indicate that students with irregular sleep patterns experienced delayed circadian rhythms and lower academic performance, with a positive correlation observed between SRI and academic success. The study suggests that light exposure patterns significantly influence circadian timing and proposes that light-based interventions could improve sleep regularity in this demographic.
