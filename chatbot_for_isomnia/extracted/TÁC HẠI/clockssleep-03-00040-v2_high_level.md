# Title: How Smart Is It to Go to Bed with the Phone? The Impact of Short-Wavelength Light and Affective States on Sleep and Circadian Rhythms

## Summary: This article investigates the effects of short-wavelength light emitted from smartphones on sleep and circadian rhythms. The study, involving 33 male participants, utilized polysomnography and body temperature measurements over three experimental nights. It found that reading on a smartphone without a blue-light filter reduced slow-wave sleep and affected cortisol awakening responses, while evening melatonin levels were also diminished. The research highlights the disruptive impact of short-wavelength light on sleep quality and circadian rhythms, suggesting that affective states can influence subjective sleep quality.
