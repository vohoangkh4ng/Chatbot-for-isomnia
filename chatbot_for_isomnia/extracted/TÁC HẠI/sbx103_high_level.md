# Title: Disrupting Sleep: The Effects of Sleep Loss on Psychotic Experiences Tested in an Experimental Study With Mediation Analysis

## Summary: This study investigates the causal relationship between insomnia and psychotic experiences, specifically paranoia and hallucinations. Using a within-subjects crossover design, 68 nonclinical volunteers underwent a sleep loss condition (restricted to 4 hours of sleep for 3 nights) and a control condition. Results indicated that sleep loss significantly increased reports of paranoia, hallucinations, and cognitive disorganization, alongside heightened negative affect. Mediation analyses suggested that the changes in psychotic experiences were mediated by negative affect rather than memory impairment, supporting the hypothesis that insomnia plays a causal role in the occurrence of certain psychotic experiences.
