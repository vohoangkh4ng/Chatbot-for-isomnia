# Title: The relationship between smartphone addiction and musculoskeletal pain prevalence among young population: a cross-sectional study

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of smartphone addiction on the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain among university students. It includes a survey with demographic data, the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS), and the modified Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Results from 249 participants indicate high prevalence rates of musculoskeletal pain in the upper back (70.3%), neck (65.9%), and wrists/hands (68.7%). The study finds significant correlations between SAS scores, smartphone usage duration, and musculoskeletal pain in various body parts, suggesting that smartphone addiction is associated with increased pain prevalence.
