# Title: Structural Alterations in Large-scale Brain networks and their Relationship with Sleep Disturbances in the Adolescent population

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between gray matter volumes (GMVs) in the brains of adolescents and sleep disturbances. The study, conducted on a sample of Korean adolescents, found that GMVs in various global regions were negatively correlated with sleep disturbances. The findings suggest that structural changes in large-scale brain networks may be linked to the severity of sleep disturbances, highlighting the potential impact of sleep issues on adolescent brain development and associated health problems.
