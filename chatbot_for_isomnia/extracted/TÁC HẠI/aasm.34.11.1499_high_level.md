# Title: Poor Sleep Quality Predicts Deficient Emotion Information Processing over Time in Early Adolescence

## Summary: This article investigates the relationship between sleep quality and emotional information processing in early adolescents. It highlights that poor sleep quality, characterized by elevated night awakenings and decreased sleep efficiency, negatively impacts the ability to process emotional information, which is crucial for social competence during this developmental stage. The study involved 94 healthy children and assessed their sleep and emotional processing over three assessment waves, revealing significant correlations between sleep disturbances and emotional processing deficits. The findings underscore the importance of sleep in the socio-emotional development of adolescents.
