# Title: Adolescentsâ€™ health behaviors and obesity: Does race affect this epidemic?

## Summary: This study investigates the impact of health behaviors and individual attributes on adolescent overweight and obesity, utilizing data from Wave II of the Add Health study. The analysis reveals differing causal paths for obesity between African American and Caucasian adolescents, with African Americans showing higher susceptibility to obesity. Key findings indicate that while increased physical activity reduces obesity risk for both groups, low family socioeconomic status (SES) and sedentary behavior are significant factors for Caucasians, whereas increased sleep hours are positively related to obesity among African Americans. The results underscore the importance of considering racial disparities in developing effective obesity intervention strategies for U.S. adolescents.
