# Title: Deficits in Emotion Regulation Partly Mediate the Relation Between Sleep Problems and Depressive Symptoms in Adolescent Inpatients With Depression

## Summary: This study investigates the relationship between sleep problems and depressive symptoms in adolescents, focusing on the mediating role of emotion regulation strategies. Conducted with a clinical sample of 602 adolescents aged 13-18, the research found that sleep issues significantly influence depressive symptoms through decreased use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies and increased use of maladaptive ones. The findings suggest that incorporating sleep and emotion regulation skills into treatment programs could be beneficial, highlighting the need for further longitudinal studies to confirm these results.
