# Title: Sleep deprivation increases formation of false memory

## Summary: This article investigates the impact of sleep deprivation on memory formation, specifically focusing on the creation of false memories. The study utilized the misinformation paradigm to assess how one night of total sleep deprivation and seven nights of partial sleep deprivation affect memory retrieval in healthy young adults and adolescents. Findings indicate that sleep-deprived individuals are more susceptible to incorporating misleading information into their memories, highlighting the critical role of adequate sleep in cognitive functioning and the increased vulnerability of adolescents' memory during periods of sleep curtailment. The results underscore the importance of considering an individual's sleep history when evaluating eyewitness testimony.
