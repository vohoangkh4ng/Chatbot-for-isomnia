# Title: Delayed sleep phase syndrome in adolescents: prevalence and correlates in a large population based study

## Summary: This study investigates the prevalence of Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) among adolescents and its association with insomnia and school non-attendance. Conducted in Hordaland County, Norway, the research involved 10,220 adolescents aged 16-18 years. The findings revealed a DSPS prevalence of 3.3%, with a higher occurrence in girls (3.7%) compared to boys (2.7%). Notably, over half of the adolescents with DSPS also met the criteria for insomnia. The study highlights significant odds of school non-attendance linked to DSPS, suggesting the need for comprehensive clinical approaches for adolescents exhibiting DSPS symptoms.
