# Title: Insomnia symptoms and non-suicidal self-injury in adolescence: understanding temporal relations and mechanisms

## Summary: This article proposes a theoretical model exploring the bidirectional relationship between insomnia symptoms and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescents. The authors hypothesize that insomnia leads to increased depressive symptoms and impulsivity, which in turn elevate the risk of NSSI. Conversely, the shame associated with NSSI may exacerbate insomnia through repetitive negative thinking. Utilizing longitudinal data from a sample of Swedish adolescents, the study finds that insomnia is linked to increased NSSI over time, with depressive symptoms mediating this relationship. The findings suggest that screening for insomnia in adolescents could help identify those at risk for NSSI, highlighting the need for further research into the mechanisms involved.
